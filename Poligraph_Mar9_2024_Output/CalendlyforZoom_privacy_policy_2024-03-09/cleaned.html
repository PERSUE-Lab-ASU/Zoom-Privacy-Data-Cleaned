This can include name, email address, phone number; email addresses of other people and/or Invitees; the subject of the meeting; and any other information a User provides or collects upon scheduling, pursuant to the Calendly Terms or an executed agreement with Calendly.

A few of our features also use and display the meeting titles in your calendar (these are currently our one-off meeting feature, or if you are booking with another Calendly user). In all cases, however, no details about the appointments in your connected calendar are stored in Calendly, such as who you are meeting with, their email address, or the meeting title. Although connecting your calendar to our Services makes the scheduling process much more efficient, you are not required to connect your calendar to use our Services.

If you participate in a recorded virtual meeting where we use meeting assistant functionality, we will collect a recording of the meeting. We use third party partners to assist us with recording and creating a transcription of the meeting. You may opt out of recording at any time. When recording a virtual meeting you attend, we will gather audio and visual information of you as applicable and as you appear in the meeting (for example, if you do not turn on your video at a meeting, we will not record visuals of you). We will also gather any of your personal information shared on screen during the meeting (for example, by using a “screen share” feature to present materials).</p></li><li><p height="auto" font-weight="normal" class="sc-a4aa44fb-0 gPsCkV"><b font-weight="bold" class="sc-ed1f50a8-0 gfdHMB">Information Received from Third Parties</b>.

For example, if you use the Prelude service and enable applicant tracking systems integrations for the recruiting use case within Prelude, your ATS may send to Prelude certain Personal Data as determined by you.&nbsp; You can stop sharing your information from a third-party service with us by removing our access to that service.
