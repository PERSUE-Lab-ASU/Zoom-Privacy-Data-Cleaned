("we" or "us") values our users and respects their privacy. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") governs our collection and use of data in connection with our website (the "Site"), our applications, and any services we offer (collectively, the "Services"). Terms capitalized but not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy sets forth the nature, purpose, use and sharing of any information that identifies or can be used to identify you, the visitors to the Site, and users of our Services ("Personal Information"). This Privacy Policy does not govern privacy practices associated with offline activities, websites other than ours, or practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners, third party service providers featured on the Site or in the Services or advertisers. If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should immediately discontinue use of the Services and follow the procedure described in the section entitled "Opting-Out or Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences." We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from anyone under 16 years of age. If you are under age 16, please do not provide any Personal Information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any Personal Information from a child under the age of 16, please contact us immediately.</p><h5><strong>Changes in Privacy Policy</strong></h5><p>Any Personal Information that we collect and maintain will be subject to this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time. We may change the Privacy Policy at our sole discretion. However, if at any time we make material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you of those changes on the Services and through the publishing of an updated Privacy Policy. We will highlight any material changes to the Privacy Policy (the information we collect, how we use it or why) at the top of the Privacy Policy. If as the result of such changes you want to alter the ways in which we are allowed to use your Personal Information, you can do so by following the procedure described in the section entitled "Opting-Out or Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences."</p><h5><strong>CCPA and GDPR</strong></h5><p>As of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) is in full effect. The CCPA, together with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) governs the collection and processing of Personal Information belonging to our customers. This Privacy Policy details how we comply with the CCPA, and your acceptance of this Policy by continued use of the Site and Services shall constitute your agreement to comply with the CCPA in all respects as well. Generally, this means that we will only collect and process your Personal Information in ways that you agree with (as we set out in this Policy), and if we transmit your information to any other third party, we shall ensure that they process your information for the sole purpose for which it was transmitted to them and that you are aware of such needs. We do not sell your information. You agree that you will only use the Site and Services if you agree with this Privacy Policy (and the Terms of Use), and you agree that if you would like to exercise your rights under the appropriate data protection rules, you will follow the procedures outlined in the CCPA, the GDPR, or as indicated in this Policy. We take data protection and security very seriously, and shall keep you updated as to significant shifts in our collection or processing, or the legal framework under which we operate.</p><h5>Collection of Information</h5><ul><li>We collect the Personal Information you give us when you register with the Site or use the Services, including name, address, credit card or bank information, and other Personal Information requested as part of your use of the Site or the Services, or the information you choose to give us when you use the Services.</li><li>We collect Personal Information through your LinkedIn or Facebook account when you register with such account on our Site.

We only process location data with your prior consent. To use Location-based Services, you must enable certain features of your mobile device (e.g., GPS, WiFi, or Bluetooth) to allow us to identify your location.
