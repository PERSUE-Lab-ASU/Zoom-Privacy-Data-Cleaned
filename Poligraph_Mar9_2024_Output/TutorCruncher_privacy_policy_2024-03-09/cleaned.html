    <h1 id="1-strongterms-of-servicestrong"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></h1>

<p>By using the TutorCruncher and TimeCruncher website and services (herein after the “Services”) you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Service”). TutorCruncher Ltd (Company No. 08385970) is registered in England and Wales at The Food Exchange, New Covent Garden Market, London, SW8 5EL.</p>

<p>TutorCruncher reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service, at any time. TutorCruncher will make reasonable efforts to inform you about any changes to these terms of service.</p>

<p>These terms of service apply to any person (such as a self-employed tutor) or business (such as an agency) with a TutorCruncher company account (“you”). Some clauses relate to both you and any user who you intentionally or unintentionally give access to TutorCruncher (herein after “your users”).</p>

<p>Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools, new functionality (including, without limitation, the receipt and disbursement of payments), website features or other resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service.</p>

<p>To be clear from the outset, by using our Services (including our site), you confirm that you accept these terms of use and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use our Services. We recommend that you print a copy of these terms for future reference. Continued use of the Service after any changes in future to these Terms of Service shall constitute your consent to such changes.</p>
<h3 id="3-strongsection-a-account-termsstrong"><strong>Section A: Account Terms</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>You must provide your legal name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the onboarding/registration process.</li>
<li>Your login credentials may only be used by one person – a single set of login credentials shared by multiple users is not allowed.</li>
<li>Where you are an agency with an account, you may create login credentials for as many administrators, tutors, affiliates, clients and students as you need.</li>
<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. TutorCruncher cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to protect your login information. If you know or suspect that anyone other than you knows your user identification code or password, you must promptly notify us.</li>
<li>You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction or the UK (including but not limited to copyright laws and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Business Regulations 2003 (as amended from time to time)). You agree to indemnify us in respect of any breach or violation of any such laws, meaning that you will be liable for any loss or damage we suffer as a result of or in connection with such breach or violation. </li>
<li>You are responsible for all Content posted, activity conducted and all persons who access (or even just view or see screenshots of) our Services through your account or internet connection. You should not permit any person who is not the account holder to access or interact with your account or our Services without first making them aware of these Terms of Service. In any event, all such activity that occurs under your account including Content posted by or suggested by other people shall be your responsibility (save where TutorCruncher has accessed or is performing maintenance on any part of the site or your account).</li>
<li>You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content, but you are required to, and you hereby do, grant TutorCruncher a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform that user-generated content in connection with the Services.</li>
<li>We do not guarantee that our Services or any content on our site, will always be available or be uninterrupted. We may suspend or withdraw or restrict the availability of all or any part of our Services for business and operational reasons. We will try to give you reasonable notice of any suspension or withdrawal.</li>
</ol><h3 id="3-strongsection-b-payments-and-refundsstrong"><strong>Section B: Payments and Refunds</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>If you sign up for a free trial on a paying account, and you do not cancel or become a full member within 14 days, you will be sent an e-mail inviting you to begin paying for your subscription. If you choose not to pay once your trial has expired, your account will be suspended until payment is received. If you enter your payment information before the trial has ended, your trial ends on that day.</li>
<li>The Service is billed in arrears on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for unused months with an open account.</li>
<li>If you choose to save your details when paying for TutorCruncher’s service, TutorCruncher reserves the right to take payment for invoices from that card.</li>
<li>All payments are to be made in GBP, EUR or USD unless otherwise agreed.</li>
<li>TutorCruncher reserves the right to change our monthly fees upon 90 days notice from us. Fee change notices may be posted to the Service or on the TutorCruncher website.</li>
</ol><h3 id="3-strongsection-c-fee-calculationsstrong"><strong>Section C: Fee Calculations</strong></h3>

<p>Depending on your price plan, your fee may be made up for the following components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A fixed monthly fee. This may be charged upfront or retroactively depending on your price plan.</li>
<li>A fee for ‘Online payments’, which is a percentage of all payments made through our online card payment system. These fees are taken at the time of transaction.</li>
<li>A fee for ‘Offline payments’, which is a percentage of all lessons and ad hoc charges put through the system that haven’t been paid for using the online card payment system. These fees are generated at the end of each month and charged
in arrears. This is worked out by taking the sum of all charges for complete or “cancelled but chargeable” appointments and undeleted Ad Hoc Charges for each calendar month, then subtracting the sum of the payments made via the online card payment system.</li>
<li>If you avoid putting charge amounts through TutorCruncher by not invoicing to avoid fees and if it comes to our attention this has happened without any agreement made to allow you to do so, TutorCruncher is in the right to collect the amount owed as per your contracted fees.</li>
</ol><h3 id="3-strongsection-d-cancellation-and-terminationstrong"><strong>Section D: Cancellation and Termination</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>You alone are responsible for the proper cancellation of your account. You may cancel your account by emailing info@tutorcruncher.com.</li>
<li>TutorCruncher may cancel or suspend your account immediately without notice for any of the following reasons:
<ol>
<li>Failure to pay an invoice or late payment (payment delayed by 5 days or more) .</li>
<li>Illegal activity involving or in any way relating to use or misuse of TutorCruncher.</li>
<li>Any attempt by your users to extract data from the TutorCruncher system which you do not rightly have access to or damage TutorCruncher such that such access is made easier for others.</li>
<li>Any damage (intentionally or otherwise) to the service TutorCruncher offers by your users.</li>
<li>Any activity by your users which results in a significant increase in the costs to TutorCruncher of providing the TutorCruncher service.</li>
<li>Any activity by your users which defames TutorCruncher or damages its reputation.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In the event of cancellation or long-term suspension TutorCruncher will provide exports of your data using all TutorCruncher’s standard export features free of charge unless prevented from doing so by law. If any further data is required TutorCruncher will make a reasonable effort to provide that data in a usable format charging a reasonable hourly rate for that work (being no less than £100 per hour).</li>
<li>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will receive one final invoice usage in the month of cancellation.</li>
<li>Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content associated with your Account.</li>
<li>TutorCruncher reserves the right to refuse service to any new customer for any reason.</li>
<li>TutorCruncher reserves the right to modify the service at any time without notice. Unless otherwise agreed all customers will be provided with the same service as defined by their pricing tier.</li>

<p>Where we engage in some international transfers of Personal Data (those which would be considered to be outside the EEA and UK) we shall continue to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as the deemed application of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.
