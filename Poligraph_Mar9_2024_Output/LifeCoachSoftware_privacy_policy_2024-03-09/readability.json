In the event of delays over 60 days, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable receipt of a California Resident\u2019s request. The response we provide will explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.\n\n            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before fulfilling your request.\n          \n        \n      ", "length": 32148, "excerpt": "Privacy Policy", "siteName": null, "applied": false}
