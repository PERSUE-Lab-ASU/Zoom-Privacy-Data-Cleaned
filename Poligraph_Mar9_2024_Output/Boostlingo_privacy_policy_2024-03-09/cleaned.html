With ACH autopay, Boostlingo will automatically withdraw funds from Customer’s pre-approved bank account within two (2) business days of the invoice date.</p>
<p>7.1.3. Taxes: All subscription and/or platform usage fees are exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature including, for example, value-added; sales; use; or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer or LSP is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases under any applicable Order Form. If Boostlingo has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer or LSP is responsible under this Section, Boostlingo will invoice Customer or LSP and Customer or LSP will pay that amount unless Customer or LSP provides Boostlingo with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.<span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr" data-sk="tooltip_parent">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>7.2 In the event that LSP fails to make any payment when due, Boostlingo may, in addition to all other remedies available to it, suspend LSP’s account and shutdown further use of the Products. LSP agrees to provide such financial information regarding LSP and any of its Partners from time to time as may be reasonably requested by Boostlingo to verify the creditworthiness of LSP and any of its Partners. A late payment charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum allowed by law, shall be assessed on all overdue amounts. LSP shall reimburse Boostlingo’s costs of collection including, but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Boostlingo reserves the right to shut down LSP’s access temporarily or permanently to the Products if the LSP has unpaid undisputed invoices that are past due.</p>
<p>7.3 Disputed Payments. If LSP reasonably disputes any portion of a Boostlingo invoice, LSP must pay the undisputed portion of the invoice and submit written notice of the claim (with sufficient detail of the nature of the claim, the amount and invoices in dispute and information necessary to identify the affected Product(s)) for the disputed amount. All claims must be submitted to Boostlingo in writing within sixty (60) days from the date of the invoice for those Products. LSP waives the right to dispute any charges not disputed within such sixty (60) day period. If the dispute is resolved against LSP, LSP shall pay such amounts plus interest at the rate referenced in Section 7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Boostlingo will not exercise its right of suspension in the event LSP provides Boostlingo notice that LSP disputes such charges, in good faith, pays all undisputed charges on time, and cooperates diligently to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p><strong>8 LICENSE; OWNERSHIP AND RESTRICTIONS.</strong></p>
<p>8.1 License Grant. Subject to LSP and its Partners compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the payment of applicable fees and charges, Boostlingo grants to LSP and its Partners a limited, revocable, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to (a) resell the Products to End Users solely for End Users’ use for internal business purposes ; (b) use the Products; and (c) (i) market the Products to End Users, (ii) demonstrate the Products to End Users, and (iii) service and support End Users.

<p>8.2 Ownership.<br>
8.2.1 Intellectual Property. LSP acknowledges that all right, title and interest in the Products, including any and all software and other technology used to provide the Products and any intellectual property rights therein or thereto, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Boostlingo and its licensors. No title to or ownership of the intellectual property contained in the Products or any part of the Products or Boostlingo’s confidential information is transferred to LSP.</p>
<p>8.2.2 Development and Enhancements. LSP acknowledges that Boostlingo owns all rights, title and interest in and to the Products as well as all enhancements, updates, modifications, local versions or any derivatives of the Products, works produced pursuant to an SOW hereto, or any other works developed by Boostlingo in performance of this Agreement. LSP agrees that any works under this Agreement shall not be considered a “work made for hire”. Excluding LSP’s limited license granted in Section 8.1 of this Agreement, LSP hereby irrevocably transfers, conveys and assigns and agrees to transfer convey and assign, exclusively to Boostlingo any rights Boostlingo may have or may hereafter acquire or may propose to have or hereafter acquire in and to any Products, derivatives of the Products, updates or enhancements, and any works created pursuant to this Agreement, including all patent, trademark and copyright in the Products. For the avoidance of doubt, the Products (software, firmware and/or documentation) are licensed and not sold and all license rights shall immediately and automatically terminate in the event this Agreement is terminated and all rights to the Products licensed hereunder shall revert to Boostlingo and Boostlingo’s licensors.</p>
<p>8.2.3 Use of Marks. Unless otherwise permitted under this Agreement, LSP shall not delete or alter any Boostlingo trade names, trademarks or other insignia which are affixed to the Products or related documentation and may only use such marks in conjunction with its marketing and/or resale of the Products in accordance with Boostlingo’s then current guidelines on usage. LSP shall refrain from any other direct or indirect use or registration of such marks or similar marks.</p>
<p>8.2.4 IP Infringement Claims. LSP shall promptly notify Boostlingo of any claims with respect to the license or use of the Products or to any alleged intellectual property infringement. Boostlingo and its licensors reserve all other rights.</p>
<p>8.3 Restrictions.

LSP agrees to notify Boostlingo immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorized copying, transfer, disclosure, reverse assembling, or reverse compiling of any Product.</p>
<p><strong>9 RECORDS AND AUDIT.</strong> For the term of this Agreement and one year after Customer shall maintain accurate and complete financial records sufficient to justify its compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. Boostlingo reserves the right to audit by an independent auditor, at Boostlingo’s expense, all applicable books and records relating to the Products. Upon prior written notice by Boostlingo and no more than once a calendar year, LSP shall provide access to such records during normal business hours. Boostlingo shall bear the costs of an audit, including reasonable costs incurred to Customer to support the audit except where the audit reveals any default, fraudulent activity, or breach of this Agreement by LSP in which case LSP shall bear the cost of such audit. LSP shall implement any remedial action an audit reasonable identifies as necessary at its own cost.</p>
<p><strong>10 CONFIDENTIALITY.</strong></p>
<p>10.1 Confidentiality. During the Term of this Agreement, each party may disclose to the other certain Confidential Information to the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (a) is known to the Receiving Party prior to receipt hereunder from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, (b) becomes lawfully known (independently of disclosure by the Disclosing Party) to the Receiving Party from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, (c) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be secret or confidential, except through a breach of this Agreement, or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information.</p>
<p>10.2 Protection of Confidential Information. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Receiving Party will not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent, except disclosure to and subsequent uses by the Receiving Party’s employees or consultants on a need-to-know basis, provided that such employees or consultants have executed written agreements restricting use or disclosure of such Confidential Information that are at least as restrictive as the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Section. Subject to the foregoing nondisclosure and non-use obligations, the Receiving Party agrees to use at least the same care and precaution in protecting such Confidential Information as the Receiving Party uses to protect the Receiving Party’s own Confidential Information and trade secrets, and in no event less than reasonable care. The receiving party is prohibited from using the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to develop, make or market products or services that are or may be competitive with the products or services of the disclosing Party. Each Party acknowledges that due to the unique nature of the other Party’s Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will not have an adequate remedy in money or damages in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information. In addition to any other remedies that may be available in law, in equity or otherwise, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent such unauthorized use or disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LSP’s obligations will survive any termination of this Agreement or LSP’s relationship with Boostlingo.</p>
<p>10.3 Return or Destruction of Materials. All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information that have been disclosed by either Party to the other Party, and all summaries, copies, descriptions, excerpts or extracts thereof that are in the possession of the other Party, shall be and remain the property of the Disclosing Party and shall be promptly returned to the Disclosing Party, and the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to promptly delete or destroy all summaries, copies, descriptions, excerpts or extracts thereof in their possession upon the Disclosing Party’s written request. The Receiving Party shall have no obligation to delete or destroy copies that: (a) are contained in an archived computer system backup that was made in accordance with such Party’s security, e-mail retention, and/or disaster recovery procedures; or (b) are kept by a Party for record-keeping, archival, or governance purposes in compliance with such Party’s document retention policies. Any such retained Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for so long as it is retained. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will continue to be bound by its confidentiality and other obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. At the Disclosing Party’s option, the Receiving Party will provide written certification of its compliance with this Section.</p>
<p><strong>11 INDEMNIFICATION.</strong></p>
<p>11.1 BOOSTLINGO INDEMNIFICATION. Boostlingo shall defend or settle any suit or action against LSP based on a claim that the Product, to the extent provided by Boostlingo and not modified by LSP, Customer or their respective agents, infringes any third party’s U.S. or Canadian patent or copyright; provided, that (a) LSP gives Boostlingo prompt written notice of any claim, action or suit, sole authority to defend or settle as it sees fit, and full cooperation, and (b) Boostlingo is not obligated to indemnify or defend LSP or settle such claim, action or suit if the primary basis of the infringement arises out of (i) modification of the Product by anyone other than Boostlingo, (ii) combination of the Product with freeware, shareware or other third party software, or (iii) use of the Product for other than its intended purpose. If LSP or Customer is prevented from using any Product provided by Boostlingo due to claims of infringement of any U.S. or Canadian patent or copyright, Boostlingo may, at its expense: (i) procure the right to continue using the Product; (ii) modify the Product so that it is non-infringing; or (iii) procure a replacement product that has substantially the same functionality. If none of the above options are reasonably available, then Boostlingo may terminate this Agreement and all sublicenses granted by LSP hereunder, and refund to LSP the fees paid for such infringing Product(s).</p>
<p>11.2 LSP INDEMNIFICATION. LSP shall indemnify, and hold harmless Boostlingo against any and all losses, liabilities, lawsuits, claims, fines, expenses (including attorney’s fees and costs of litigation and investigation), costs or judgments arising out of: (i) any improper or unauthorized actions, activities or misrepresentations by LSP or any of its employees or agents in its performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to misrepresentations of the performance of the product; (ii) LSP’s use of the Products in breach of this Agreement, (iii) LSP’s violation of any warranty, representation or covenant under this Agreement; (iv) LSP’s violation of any third party rights, including, without limitation, infringement of any copyright, trademark or patent right, violation of any other proprietary right and invasion of any privacy or publicity right; or (v) Boostlingo’s authorized use of the Customer data. The foregoing indemnification obligation of LSP is contingent upon Boostlingo promptly notifying LSP in writing of such claim (provided the failure or delay in doing so shall not relieve LSP from any obligations to indemnify Boostlingo except to the extent that such delay or failure materially prejudices the defense of such claim), permitting LSP sole authority to control the defense or settlement of such claim, provided that LSP may not settle any such claim unless it unconditionally releases Boostlingo of all liability, and providing LSP reasonable assistance (at LSP’s sole expense) in connection therewith.</p>
<p><strong>12 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES &amp; DISCLAIMER.</strong></p>
<p>12.1 LSP’s Representation &amp; Warranty. LSP hereby represents and warrants that it has no outstanding contract or arrangement with any other person or entity that conflicts with or infringes on the licensing arrangement contemplated hereunder or which would prevent LSP from entering into and performing under this Agreement in good faith.</p>
