A late payment charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum allowed by law, shall be assessed on all overdue amounts. LSP shall reimburse Boostlingo\u2019s costs of collection including, but not limited to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.

All claims must be submitted to Boostlingo in writing within sixty (60) days from the date of the invoice for those Products. LSP waives the right to dispute any charges not disputed within such sixty (60) day period. If the dispute is resolved against LSP, LSP shall pay such amounts plus interest at the rate referenced in Section 7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Boostlingo will not exercise its right of suspension in the event LSP provides Boostlingo notice that LSP disputes such charges, in good faith, pays all undisputed charges on time, and cooperates diligently to resolve the dispute.</p>\n<p><strong>8 LICENSE; OWNERSHIP AND RESTRICTIONS.</strong></p>\n<p>8.1 License Grant.

Each Party acknowledges that due to the unique nature of the other Party\u2019s Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will not have an adequate remedy in money or damages in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information. In addition to any other remedies that may be available in law, in equity or otherwise, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent such unauthorized use or disclosure.

Boostlingo shall defend or settle any suit or action against LSP based on a claim that the Product, to the extent provided by Boostlingo and not modified by LSP, Customer or their respective agents, infringes any third party\u2019s U.S. or Canadian patent or copyright; provided, that (a) LSP gives Boostlingo prompt written notice of any claim, action or suit, sole authority to defend or settle as it sees fit, and full cooperation, and (b) Boostlingo is not obligated to indemnify or defend LSP or settle such claim, action or suit if the primary basis of the infringement arises out of (i) modification of the Product by anyone other than Boostlingo, (ii) combination of the Product with freeware, shareware or other third party software, or (iii) use of the Product for other than its intended purpose. If LSP or Customer is prevented from using any Product provided by Boostlingo due to claims of infringement of any U.S. or Canadian patent or copyright, Boostlingo may, at its expense: (i) procure the right to continue using the Product; (ii) modify the Product so that it is non-infringing; or (iii) procure a replacement product that has substantially the same functionality.

The foregoing indemnification obligation of LSP is contingent upon Boostlingo promptly notifying LSP in writing of such claim (provided the failure or delay in doing so shall not relieve LSP from any obligations to indemnify Boostlingo except to the extent that such delay or failure materially prejudices the defense of such claim), permitting LSP sole authority to control the defense or settlement of such claim, provided that LSP may not settle any such claim unless it unconditionally releases Boostlingo of all liability, and providing LSP reasonable assistance (at LSP\u2019s sole expense) in connection therewith.</p>\n<p><strong>12 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES &amp; DISCLAIMER.</strong></p>\n<p>12.1 LSP\u2019s Representation &amp; Warranty.

LSP shall reimburse Boostlingo\u2019s costs of collection including, but not limited to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.

All claims must be submitted to Boostlingo in writing within sixty (60) days from the date of the invoice for those Products. LSP waives the right to dispute any charges not disputed within such sixty (60) day period. If the dispute is resolved against LSP, LSP shall pay such amounts plus interest at the rate referenced in Section 7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Boostlingo will not exercise its right of suspension in the event LSP provides Boostlingo notice that LSP disputes such charges, in good faith, pays all undisputed charges on time, and cooperates diligently to resolve the dispute.\n8 LICENSE; OWNERSHIP AND RESTRICTIONS.\n8.1 License Grant.

Upon prior written notice by Boostlingo and no more than once a calendar year, LSP shall provide access to such records during normal business hours. Boostlingo shall bear the costs of an audit, including reasonable costs incurred to Customer to support the audit except where the audit reveals any default, fraudulent activity, or breach of this Agreement by LSP in which case LSP shall bear the cost of such audit. LSP shall implement any remedial action an audit reasonable identifies as necessary at its own cost.\n10 CONFIDENTIALITY.\n10.1 Confidentiality. During the Term of this Agreement, each party may disclose to the other certain Confidential Information to the other party.

Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Receiving Party will not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party without the Disclosing Party\u2019s prior written consent, except disclosure to and subsequent uses by the Receiving Party\u2019s employees or consultants on a need-to-know basis, provided that such employees or consultants have executed written agreements restricting use or disclosure of such Confidential Information that are at least as restrictive as the Receiving Party\u2019s obligations under this Section. Subject to the foregoing nondisclosure and non-use obligations, the Receiving Party agrees to use at least the same care and precaution in protecting such Confidential Information as the Receiving Party uses to protect the Receiving Party\u2019s own Confidential Information and trade secrets, and in no event less than reasonable care. The receiving party is prohibited from using the disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information to develop, make or market products or services that are or may be competitive with the products or services of the disclosing Party. Each Party acknowledges that due to the unique nature of the other Party\u2019s Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will not have an adequate remedy in money or damages in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information. In addition to any other remedies that may be available in law, in equity or otherwise, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent such unauthorized use or disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LSP\u2019s obligations will survive any termination of this Agreement or LSP\u2019s relationship with Boostlingo.\n10.3 Return or Destruction of Materials. All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information that have been disclosed by either Party to the other Party, and all summaries, copies, descriptions, excerpts or extracts thereof that are in the possession of the other Party, shall be and remain the property of the Disclosing Party and shall be promptly returned to the Disclosing Party, and the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to promptly delete or destroy all summaries, copies, descriptions, excerpts or extracts thereof in their possession upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s written request.

Any such retained Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for so long as it is retained. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will continue to be bound by its confidentiality and other obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. At the Disclosing Party\u2019s option, the Receiving Party will provide written certification of its compliance with this Section.\n11 INDEMNIFICATION.\n11.1 BOOSTLINGO INDEMNIFICATION. Boostlingo shall defend or settle any suit or action against LSP based on a claim that the Product, to the extent provided by Boostlingo and not modified by LSP, Customer or their respective agents, infringes any third party\u2019s U.S. or Canadian patent or copyright; provided, that (a) LSP gives Boostlingo prompt written notice of any claim, action or suit, sole authority to defend or settle as it sees fit, and full cooperation, and (b) Boostlingo is not obligated to indemnify or defend LSP or settle such claim, action or suit if the primary basis of the infringement arises out of (i) modification of the Product by anyone other than Boostlingo, (ii) combination of the Product with freeware, shareware or other third party software, or (iii) use of the Product for other than its intended purpose. If LSP or Customer is prevented from using any Product provided by Boostlingo due to claims of infringement of any U.S. or Canadian patent or copyright, Boostlingo may, at its expense: (i) procure the right to continue using the Product; (ii) modify the Product so that it is non-infringing; or (iii) procure a replacement product that has substantially the same functionality. If none of the above options are reasonably available, then Boostlingo may terminate this Agreement and all sublicenses granted by LSP hereunder, and refund to LSP the fees paid for such infringing Product(s).\n11.2 LSP INDEMNIFICATION. LSP shall indemnify, and hold harmless Boostlingo against any and all losses, liabilities, lawsuits, claims, fines, expenses (including attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation and investigation), costs or judgments arising out of: (i) any improper or unauthorized actions, activities or misrepresentations by LSP or any of its employees or agents in its performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to misrepresentations of the performance of the product; (ii) LSP\u2019s use of the Products in breach of this Agreement, (iii) LSP\u2019s violation of any warranty, representation or covenant under this Agreement; (iv) LSP\u2019s violation of any third party rights, including, without limitation, infringement of any copyright, trademark or patent right, violation of any other proprietary right and invasion of any privacy or publicity right; or (v) Boostlingo\u2019s authorized use of the Customer data. The foregoing indemnification obligation of LSP is contingent upon Boostlingo promptly notifying LSP in writing of such claim (provided the failure or delay in doing so shall not relieve LSP from any obligations to indemnify Boostlingo except to the extent that such delay or failure materially prejudices the defense of such claim), permitting LSP sole authority to control the defense or settlement of such claim, provided that LSP may not settle any such claim unless it unconditionally releases Boostlingo of all liability, and providing LSP reasonable assistance (at LSP\u2019s sole expense) in connection therewith.\n12 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES & DISCLAIMER.\n12.1 LSP\u2019s Representation & Warranty.
