While we don’t like to expose too much detail around our practices (as it can empower the very people we are protecting ourselves against), we have provided some general information below to give you confidence in how we secure the data entrusted to us.</p><h3>Data Center Security</h3><p>CoNote's applications and platforms, including the CoNote AI Engine, are deployed through Amazon's AWS data centers in the US East region.</p><p>We have flexibility through the AWS platform to store data in other regions, should our client have a specific request. Our data centers manage physical security 24/7 with biometric scanners.</p><p>We maintain data encryption at rest, advanced data filtration at the API level, and all of our APIs require token-based security.</p><p>CoNote employees cannot physically access the AWS data centers. Access is strictly limited to authorized personnel. You can read more about AWS data center policies <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/controls/">here</a>.</p><h3>Protection from Data Loss or Corruption</h3><p>Our databases are maintained on the AWS RDS platform and are designed for disaster recovery and automatic failover.</p><p>Account data is backed up at regular intervals throughout the day to multiple off-site locations.</p><h3>Application Level Security</h3><p>CoNote supports multiple ways of user authentication including OAuth2 and password authentication. CoNote never stores plain-text passwords and always encrypts its databases at rest.</p><p>All application communication is encrypted over SSL TLS 1.2 channels.</p><p>We perform regular external security penetration tests throughout the year using different vendors. The tests involve high-level server penetration tests, in-depth testing for vulnerabilities inside the application, and social engineering drills.</p><h3>Internal Protocol and Education</h3><p>We continuously train employees on best security practices, including how to identify social engineering, phishing scams, and hackers.</p><p>Employees on teams that have access to customer data (such as tech support and our engineers) undergo criminal history and credit background checks prior to employment.</p><p>All employees sign a Privacy Safeguard Agreement outlining their responsibility in protecting customer data.</p><p>All employees receive data privacy training.</p><h3>Responsible Disclosure</h3><p>If you’ve discovered a vulnerability in any CoNote service, please don’t share it publicly. Instead, please submit a report to us at <a href="mailto:security@conote.ai">security@CoNote.ai</a>. We review all security concerns brought to our attention, and we take a proactive approach to emerging security issues. Every day, new security issues and attack vectors are created. CoNote strives to stay on top of the latest security developments both internally and by working with external security researchers and companies. We appreciate the community’s efforts in creating a more secure web.</p><p>If you believe your account has been compromised or you are seeing suspicious activity on your account please email <a href="mailto:security@conote.ai">security@conote.ai</a>.</p><p><br></p></div></div><div class="divider _64px template-pages-start-here"></div><div id="ai-privacy-policy"><div class="rich-text w-richtext"><h2>AI Privacy Policy</h2><p>This policy is a supplement to our Privacy Policy and Data Security Statement and outlines CoNote’s practices for upholding privacy, protecting confidential information, and ensuring ethical uses of our AI.</p><h4>CoNote’s AI safety protocols</h4><p><strong>Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation:</strong></p><p>a. Minimize Data Collection: </p><ul role="list"><li>The only data collected by our AI engine is that which will directly influence your model. This data will not be used outside of your singular tenant space, where the model is run. </li><li>Our AI will never collect any other data without you explicitly enabling this collection.</li></ul><p>b. Purpose Specification: </p><ul role="list"><li>If you enable data collection, the sole purpose for this data collection by our AI engine will be to optimize the model.</li><li>In this instance, no confidential information will be collected or distributed.</li><li>The only information that will be collected are anonymized artifacts related to fine tuning the performance of the AI engine.</li></ul><p>Depending on your elected settings, data collection can be edited as desired to include more or less data. Again, unless you explicitly enable or authorize collection, no additional data collection will occur.</p><p><strong>Data Security and Confidentiality:</strong></p><p>a. Encryption: CoNote employs strong encryption techniques to protect confidential data during storage, transmission, and processing. </p><p>b. Access Controls: Based on user tier, robust access controls are available to limit data access to authorized personnel only and prevent unauthorized use or disclosure.</p><p>c. Anonymization and De-Identification: We apply best practice techniques to anonymize or de-identify personal data used in AI training and processing, ensuring privacy protection.</p><p>d. Any external APIs used with customer data have been vetted, are SOC2 type II certified, and do not use private data to train anything external on the API provider end. </p><p><strong>User Rights and Consent:</strong></p><p>a. Consent Mechanisms: Data will not be used between users, or even within one user’s tenant space, to train and improve engine results. Consent mechanisms will be implemented so that users can opt in to allow their own model to be trained on past data that they have submitted.</p><p>b. User Rights: CoNote respects individuals rights, such as the right to access, correct, and delete their personal data. We make every effort to make this clear and easy to understand within the application and also easy to contact the CoNote team if any concerns arise.</p><h4>CoNote’s Ethical Use of AI:</h4><p>Fairness and Non-discrimination: We strive to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a manner that is fair and unbiased. We are committed to avoiding discriminatory outcomes based on factors such as race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status.</p><p>Human Autonomy and Oversight: We recognize the importance of human autonomy and decision-making in the use of AI. We believe that AI systems should be designed to augment human capabilities, rather than replace or undermine them. Human oversight and intervention should be available when significant decisions are made by AI systems.</p><p>Safety and Reliability: We prioritize the development and deployment of AI systems that are safe and reliable. This includes rigorous testing, continuous monitoring, and ongoing assessment of potential risks and harms associated with AI technologies.</p><p>Social and Environmental Well-being: We consider the broader social and environmental impacts of AI systems. We strive to minimize negative consequences and actively work towards promoting positive societal outcomes, such as addressing social inequalities and minimizing environmental harm.</p><p>Collaboration and Multi-stakeholder Engagement: We believe that addressing the ethical challenges of AI requires collaboration and engagement among various stakeholders, including researchers, developers, policymakers, civil society, and affected communities. We actively seek diverse perspectives and input to inform our policies and practices.</p><p>Education and Awareness: We are committed to promoting education and awareness about AI technologies and their ethical implications. </p><p>Continuous Improvement: We acknowledge that AI technologies and ethical considerations are continually evolving. We commit to learning from experience, conducting regular assessments, and adapting our policies and practices to align with emerging ethical standards and societal expectations.<br></p><p></p></div></div><div class="divider _64px template-pages-start-here"></div><div id="privacy-policy"><div class="rich-text mg-bottom-24px w-richtext"><h2>Privacy Policy</h2><p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>You have full control over the data you share with us.</li><li>We do not sell your data.</li><li>Your data will be stored in secure data centers.</li></ul><p>Your privacy is important to us.

Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p><p>Binding Arbitration</p><p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in San Diego, California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p><p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in San Diego, California, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.</p><p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p><p>Restrictions</p><p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p><p>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</p><p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p><ol role="list" start="17"><li>CORRECTIONS</li></ol><p>There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.
