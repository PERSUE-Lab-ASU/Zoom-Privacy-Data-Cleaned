                        <h3>Information that we collect</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Personal Information we collect from customers helps us personalize and continually
                            improve your experience. Here are the types of information we gather:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Information Provided by You.</em> During your use of the Site, we may collect certain
                            Personal Information delivered by you to us either as part of your registration to the Site
                            or in any other way. This Personal Information may be updated by you from time to time. As a
                            result of your use of the Services, you may supply us with such Personal Information as your
                            name, e-mail address, uploaded content and metadata such as the source of that content.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Automatic Information.</em> When using our Site, we may also collect certain standard
                            Personal Information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP
                            address, your browser information (including browser type, capabilities and language), your
                            operating system, the date and time you accessed the website, and the website from which you
                            linked to our Site. In addition, we may collect other information from you (such as
                            location-based data) that have been stripped of Personal Information. We may group some or
                            all this Personal Information into aggregate data in order to describe the use of the
                            Services and our Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers
                            or other third parties, or in response to a government request. We may also group
                            demographic information that we collect from our users into aggregate data for the same
                            purposes. We reserve the right to use and share any non-Personal Information with third
                            parties for any lawful purpose. We may associate your Personal Information with non-Personal
                            Information within our database and we treat all the associated information as Personal
                            Information under this Privacy Policy. However, except as noted below, we do not share this
                            associated Personal Information with third parties.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Use of information collected</h3>

                        <p>
                            <em>Internal Use.</em> We use Personal Information for internal purposes only, to improve
                            our Site and to better tailor the Site to meet your needs. In addition, we use the Personal
                            Information collected to analyze Site usage and to deliver information to you about certain
                            promotions, services or items that might interest you. We may use your e-mail address to
                            contact you regarding Site notices from time to time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Editing Information.</em> You may review and edit any of your Personal Information by
                            using your e-mail address and password. If you cancel your account, your Personal
                            Information shall be deleted from our database except for residual information within our
                            databases, access logs, backup logs and other records, which may or may not contain
                            personally identifiable information.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Resolving Problems.</em> We may use your Personal Information and other data obtained
                            from your current and past activities, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We will not sell, trade or rent your Personal Information to others unless you explicitly
                            provide us with permission to do so.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Disclosure of personal information</h3>

                        <p>
                            <em>At Your Request.</em> We will not disclose, sell or transfer any of your Personal
                            Information to any third parties, except if you request us to do so as part of the Services.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Legal Disclosures.</em> In the event we are required to disclose Personal Information
                            and other related information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court
                            orders, or in compliance with applicable laws, we will make such disclosure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Sale of Business.</em> In the event the ownership of all or a part of our business were
                            to change, your Personal Information and other related information pertinent to the
                            business' operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>To Protect the Services.</em> We may disclose your Personal Information and other
                            related information in the event we reasonably believe such disclosure is necessary to
                            protect the Services, our rights or property, or the rights of any third party.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Third Party Service Providers.</em> We use third-party service providers to perform
                            certain services on our behalf. We may provide your Personal Information to these
                            third-party service providers when the information is necessary for them to perform their
                            duties. These third-party service providers are contractually restricted from using Personal
                            Information for any other purpose and required to comply with all applicable laws with
                            respect to the your Personal Information and other related information they receive.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>Special Cases.</em> We may disclose your Personal Information and other related
                            information, in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such
                            information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may
                            be violating this Privacy Policy or may be causing injury to or interference with (either
                            intentionally or unintentionally), our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that
                            could be harmed by such activities. You thus authorize us to disclose any information about
                            you to law enforcement or other government officials if we, in our sole and absolute
                            discretion, believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Sharing of information</h3>

                        <p>
                            Our Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of Personal Information we collect
                            from you. To the extent that you disclose information to other parties by using the
                            Services, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the Personal Information,
                            which you disclose to them. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties and
                            users will be subject to the privacy customs and policies of such third parties.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Protection of information</h3>

                        <p>
                            Personal Information collected about you is protected in several ways. If you create a
                            Typito account, access by you to your Personal Information is available through a password
                            and unique user ID selected by you. Your password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not
                            divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your personal information resides on
                            proprietary secured servers that only selected personnel and contracts have access to via
                            password.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We use industry standard security measures to protect your Personal Information so that it
                            is not made available to unauthorized parties. However, we cannot guarantee that the
                            Personal Information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be
                            completely secure. If you have any questions regarding which measures and techniques we use,
                            feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@typito.com">hello@typito.com</a>.
