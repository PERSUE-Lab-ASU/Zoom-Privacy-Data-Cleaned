Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements.

Similarly, under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), California residents have similar rights. Those rights might include:</p><ol><li>Right to access your Personal Data – You can ask us to confirm whether or not we have and use your Personal Data, and if so, you can ask for a copy of your data.</li><li>Right to correct your Personal Data – You can ask us to correct any of your Personal Data which is incorrect, after verifying the accuracy of the data first;</li><li> Right to erase your Personal Data – You can ask us to erase your Personal Data if you think we no longer need to use it for the purpose we collected it from you. You can also ask for such erasure in any case in which the process of your data was based on your consent, or where we have used it unlawfully or where we are subject to a legal obligation to erase your Personal Data. any request for such erasure will be subject to our obligations under the law (e.g. our obligation to keep some records for tax or customs purposes).</li><li>Right to restrict our use in your Personal Data –  You can ask us to restrict our use of your Personal Data in certain circumstances.</li><li>Right to object to how we use your Personal Data – You can object to any use of your Personal Data which we have justified by our legitimate interest if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms to data protection outweigh our legitimate interest in using the information.</li><li>You can always require us to refrain from using your data for direct marketing purposes;</li><li>You can ask us to transfer your information to another organization and/or provide you with a copy of your Personal Data (Portability Right).</li><li>You have the right to lodge a complaint at any time before the relevant supervisory authority for data protection issues. However, we will appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the authorities, so please feel free to contact us in the first instance.</li></ol>We may not always be able to do what you have asked. In addition, not all of those rights apply in every jurisdiction. For example, if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are otherwise legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way. In addition, the Portability Right doesn’t apply under the CCPA. So not always we will be able or obliged to provide you with those rights.  However, we encourage you to contact us with any such request, and we will be happy to assist you.<p></p><h2>Special Notification for California Residents</h2><p>We do not sell your personal information for the intentions and purposes of the CCPA. We can use your personal data for our purposes, but only as described above or after the anonymization of such data, including aggregate data which can no longer be associated with you.</p><h2>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h2><p>We reserve the right to change this statement from time to time at our sole discretion. If we make any changes, we will post those changes here so that you can see what information we gather, how we might use that information and in what circumstances we may disclose it. By continuing to use our site or our services or otherwise provide data after we post any such changes, you accept and agree to this statement as modified.</p><p>The information on this page was last
