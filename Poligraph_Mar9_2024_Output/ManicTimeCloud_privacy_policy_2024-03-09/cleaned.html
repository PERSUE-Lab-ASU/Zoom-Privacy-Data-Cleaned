                <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Your privacy is very important to us. ManicTime products are designed to work on your hardware, with
                    no need for outside services. Your data is your own. However, for ease of use, we also provide a
                    hosted ManicTime Cloud solution, where your data is sent to our servers.</p>
                <p>During your use of our services, we may collect some information.</p>

                <h2>ManicTime Client</h2>
                <p>All tracked data stays on your machine and it is not shared with us, however during your use of
                    ManicTime we may get some data.</p>
                <h3>1. Automatic version check</h3>
                <p>By default ManicTime checks for a new version every day, at which time we get your IP, Windows
                    version and which .Net versions you have installed.
                    This information helps us decide, if we can stop supporting some Windows or .Net version. </p>
                <b>What you can do about this?</b>
                <p>You can disable daily version check in Settings, General, uncheck "Automatically check for updates".
                </p>

                <p>There is no other automatic interaction with our services.</p>

                <h3>2. Log files and crash reports</h3>
                <p>Although we do everything in our power to make ManicTime reliable, crashes still happen. When you get
                    a crash report, you will also have an option to send it to us. We might also ask you for log files.
                    Log files can contain some information, like which applications you use (not how you use them or any
                    personal data, only which applications), when ManicTime was running... </p>
                <b>What can you do about this?</b>
                <p>You can look at the log files before you send them to us, but please understand, that if you edit the
                    log files, it does obstruct our ability to help.</p>

                <h2>ManicTime Server</h2>
                <p>All data stays on your machine, we do not have access to it, however during your use of ManicTime
                    Server we may get some data.</p>

                <h3>1. Automatic version check</h3>
                <p>By default ManicTime Server checks for a new version every day, at that time we can get your IP,
                    Windows version and which .Net versions you have installed.
                    This information helps us decide, if we can stop supporting some Windows or .Net version. </p>
                <b>What you can do about this?</b>
                <p>To disable this, edit ManicTimeServerSettings.json file and include these lines:</p>
                <pre><code>{
    ......
    "automaticVersionCheck": {
        "enabled": false
    },
}
</code></pre>

                <p>There is no other automatic interaction with our services.</p>

                <h3>2. Log files and crash reports</h3>
                <p>Although we do everything in our power to make ManicTime Server reliable, crashes still happen. When
                    you get a crash report, you will also have an option to send it to us. We might also ask you for log
                    files. Log files can contain some information, like the number of users using ManicTime Server, when
                    ManicTime Server was running... </p>
                <b>What can you do about this?</b>
