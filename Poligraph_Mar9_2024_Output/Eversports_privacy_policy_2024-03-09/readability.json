Recipients and third countries This section applies to data subject groups in Section 2. \u201cWe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d refer to the respective controllers in Sections 2.1 to 2.6. We commission external service providers to undertake various assignments for us. If one of these assignments involves processing your personal data, any such service provider is a processor within the meaning of the GDPR. We have written agreements with them (in accordance with Article 28 GDPR), which govern the handling of personal data and oblige processors to comply with suitably high security standards. An up-to-date table of all processors for the Eversports Group is available here: Some recipients are controllers in their own right for data transferred to them, so such processing does not constitute commissioned processing. The payment service provider that we use, PayPal, is one of these controllers in their own right. All PayPal transactions are subject to the PayPal privacy policy. The sports providers are also controllers in their own right for data transferred to them to arrange your booking. If you would like information about a sports provider\u2019s privacy policy, please contact that sports provider directly. The Eversports Group companies work together as joint controllers. They have signed a written agreement between them (in accordance with Article 26 GDPR) in order to manage their respective responsibilities. The joint controllers work together as follows:  The data processing operations defined in Section 2 of this Privacy Statement are carried out by Eversports, Eversports DE and Appointman as joint processing operations within the meaning of Article 26 GDPR. To this end, employees of Eversports Group companies are assigned to teams that cross over the boundaries of the individual corporate entities. The main controller for the data subject categories described in sections 2.1 to 2.6 is defined in the respective sections. All data processing issues can be addressed by mail to all companies in the Eversports Group. The issues are forwarded accordingly within the Group. Data protection issues can be addressed via e-mail to the following e-mail address: [email\u00a0protected]. We also transfer certain data to recipients in third countries (i.e. countries outside the EU/EEA). For these third countries there is either an adequacy decision of the EU Commission (recipients in the USA must certify themselves under the Privacy Shield agreement, or we have signed standard contractual clauses with the recipients in order to guarantee an adequate level of protection for your data. 4. Duration of the processing\u00a0 As a basic principle, your data are processed for the duration of the contractual relationship or for as long as needed for the above purposes. In addition, the data are stored only for as long as legal data retention obligations stipulate. If the use of the data is based on your consent, the data will be processed until such consent is withdrawn. Inactive Eversports online profiles, including profile data provided by the user, are erased by default three years after the last login if they no longer have any credit. Correspondence with prospective customers and applicants is stored for six months in case of any follow-up questions. Server log files are stored for 30 days and then erased. For details of the retention period for cookies and other technical tools of the Eversports online services, please refer to the \u201cTechnical notes\u201d section. 5. Your Rights As a basic principle, you shall have the rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability and objection. To exercise these, you can contact the controller directly. If you are not sure who is the controller for the processing of your data, you can also contact the parent group (Eversports) at any time, and your request will be directed to the right place within the group. If a user objects to processing for purposes which are necessary for the performance of a contract, that user will no longer be able to use the Eversports services, and as a result their Eversports online profile will be erased. Services from sports providers on Eversports can still be used directly from the sports provider (e.g. local bookings), since existing credit balances with the sports providers do not expire as a result. Subscribers to our newsletter may withdraw their consent to their subscriptions at any time, with future effect, via the link at the bottom of a newsletter or by e-mail to [email\u00a0protected]. Sports providers may at any time withdraw their consent to their feedback (including their name and photograph) being displayed on the Eversports websites, with future effect, by e-mail to [email\u00a0protected]. Consent to interest-based advertising on third-party service providers\u2019 websites may be withdrawn at any time, with future effect, in the Eversports online profile settings. In accordance with the GDPR, you shall have the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing. The Eversports Group does not carry out automated decision-making based on the data collected. If you believe that the processing of your data contravenes data protection law or otherwise infringes your data protection rights, you may contact the relevant controller or Eversports directly ([email\u00a0protected]). We always endeavour to resolve your request to your satisfaction. You have the right to contact the supervisory authority at any time and to lodge a complaint.
