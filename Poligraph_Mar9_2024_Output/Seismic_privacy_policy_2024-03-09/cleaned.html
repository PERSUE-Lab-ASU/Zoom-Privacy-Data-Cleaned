<p>Except as otherwise provided above, if you are a California, Colorado or Connecticut resident and would like to exercise your privacy rights, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Information, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Information provided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>



<p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within the time period required by applicable law. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>



<p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p>



<ul>
<li>Submitting a request by following the instructions found at this link</li>



<li>Call us at our Toll-Free Line: 1-833-222-9139</li>



<li>Emailing us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@seismic.com" target="_blank">privacy@seismic.com</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you are a California, Colorado or Connecticut resident, you may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-17-nevada-resident-rights">17) Nevada Resident Rights</h2>



<p>If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Information to third parties. You can exercise this right by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@seismic.com" target="_blank">privacy@seismic.com</a> with the subject line “Nevada Do Not Sell Request” and providing us with your name and the email address associated with your account. Please note that we do not currently sell your Personal Information as sales are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-18-european-resident-rights">18) European Resident Rights</h2>



<p>If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), or a similar law, with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.</p>



<p>For this Section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. Seismic, Inc. and its affiliates will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Seismic Services.</p>



<p>Where applicable, this section is intended to supplement, and not replace, the other provisions of the Privacy Policy. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@seismic.com" target="_blank">privacy@seismic.com</a>. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of services to customers, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.</p>



<p>What Personal Data Do We Collect From You and How Do We Use It?</p>



<p>Please refer to Section 2 – What Information Does Seismic Collect?&nbsp; and Section 4 – How We Use the Personal Information We Collect above for information about the Personal Data we collect about you and how we use it.</p>



<p>On What Basis Do We Justify Processing Your Personal Data</p>



<p>We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below, and depending on the Personal Data involved and the specific context in which we collect it. Seismic’s processing of your Personal Data is justified on one or more of the following legal bases:</p>



<ul>
<li>Performance of Contract: The processing is necessary to perform a contract with you or take steps to enter into a contract at your request. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Seismic Services that require such data. Examples of personal data processed due to this basis include: name, email address, address and phone number.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Our Legitimate Interests: The processing is in our legitimate interests, subject to your interests and fundamental rights, and notably our legitimate interest in using applicable data to conduct and develop our business activities, such as 1) developing and maintaining relationships with our customers; 2) our operation and improvement of our business, products and services; 3) marketing of our products and services, provision of customer support; 4) protection from fraud or security threats; 5) &nbsp;compliance with legal obligations, and 6) completion of corporate transactions. Examples of personal data processed due to this basis include: name, email address, address, phone number, Content, and information about you that is automatically collected when you use the Seismic Services as detailed above.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Compliance with Law: The processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal obligation;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>With Your Consent: You have consented to the processing (for example, where we are required by local law to rely upon your prior consent for the purposes of direct marketing); or</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Defend Our Rights; Protect Vital Interests: The processing is necessary to the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or rights or to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</li>
</ul>



<p>How and With Whom Do We Share Your Data?</p>



<p>Please refer to Section 5 – With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information for Business Purposes? above for information about how and with whom we share your Personal Data.</p>



<p>What Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Personal Data?</p>



<p>You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set forth below.&nbsp; For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@seismic.com" target="_blank">privacy@seismic.com</a>. Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision.&nbsp; In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.</p>



<p>Special Note Regarding Personal Data Processed by Seismic through the Services:&nbsp; If Seismic has collected or is otherwise processing your Personal Data through your use of one of the Services we provide our customers, you should contact that customer (e.g. the business with whom you emailed or otherwise engaged online using one of our Services) in the first instance to address your rights with respect to the Personal Data.</p>



<p><strong>Access</strong>:&nbsp; You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data.</p>



<p><strong>Rectification</strong>: If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data.</p>



<p><strong>Erasure</strong>: You can request that we erase some or all of your Personal Data from our systems.</p>



<p><strong>Withdrawal of Consent</strong>: If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Seismic Services.</p>



<p><strong>Portability</strong>:&nbsp; You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a machine-readable format.&nbsp; You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.</p>



<p><strong>Objection</strong>: You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your Personal Data for certain purposes, such as for direct marketing purposes.</p>



<p><strong>Restriction of Processing</strong>:&nbsp; You can ask us to restrict further processing of your Personal Data.</p>



<p><strong>Right to File Complaint</strong>:&nbsp; You have the right to lodge a complaint about Seismic’s practices with respect to your Personal Data with the supervisory authority of your country or EU Member State.</p>



<p>Transfers of Personal Data</p>



<p>The Seismic Services are operated from the United States (“U.S.”) by Seismic and its service providers, which may process your personal data in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, the European Union, Switzerland, or Australia.&nbsp; If you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Seismic Services, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, could be provided to Seismic in the U.S. and may be hosted on U.S., Canadian, United Kingdom, European Union, Switzerland, or Australian servers, and you authorize Seismic to transfer, store and process your information to these jurisdictions, and possibly other countries.&nbsp; You hereby consent to the transfer of your data to the U.S. pursuant to a safeguard(s) for cross-border transfer, such as a data processing agreement incorporating standard data protection clauses or the Data Privacy Framework. For more information on the Data Privacy Framework, please see the Data Privacy Framework section above.</p>
