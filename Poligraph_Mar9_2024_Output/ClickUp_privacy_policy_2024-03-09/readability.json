For example, you may\n            authorize our Services to access and display files from a third-party document-sharing service within the\n            Services interface. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party\n            service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service.

To better protect you, we provide this notice explaining our\n          online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and\n          used.\n\n        This Privacy Policy relates to information collected by Mango Technologies, Inc. DBA ClickUp (referred to in\n          this Privacy Policy as \"ClickUp\" \"we\" or \"us\" or \"our\") through your use of our website and our Services,\n          features, and information available on our website (which are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy\n          as the \"ClickUp Service\").\n        \n        If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this policy, please do not use the\n            ClickUp Services.\n      \n\n      \n        Scope of this Privacy Policy\n        Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not govern all the information ClickUp may process. Our\n          commitment to customers and service providers is governed by a separate Data Protection\n            Addendum. This Privacy Policy is also incorporated into and governed by our Terms of\n            Use.  Any capitalized words we use in this Privacy Policy that we haven\u2019t defined here will have the\n          same meaning that they\u2019re given in our Terms of Use.\n        Our commitments to employees are governed by our internal employment policies.\n        In all instances we are committed to transparency with our customers, employees, and to protecting your data\n          privacy.\n      \n      \n        What Information do we Collect?\n        You will be required to establish an account in order to take advantage of certain features of the ClickUp\n          Service. If you wish to establish an account you will be required to provide us with information (including\n          personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information). In addition, we may obtain\n          your personally identifiable information from you if you identify yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with\n          questions or comments.\n        Depending on your use of the ClickUp Service, we collect two types of information:  personally\n            identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.\n\n        Personally Identifiable Information\n          Personally identifiable information identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Examples of\n          personally identifiable information may include your name, IP address, company name, job title, address,\n          e-mail address, telephone number, and billing and credit card information.\n\n        Non-Personally Identifiable Information\n          Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single item of which, by itself, cannot be used to\n          identify or contact you, which may include demographic information (such as age, profession, company industry,\n          gender, current location, or zip code), IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and statistical data\n          involving the use of the ClickUp Service. Certain non-personally identifiable information may be considered a\n          part of your personally identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example,\n          combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same\n          pieces of information may be considered non-personally identifiable information when they are taken alone or\n          combined only with other non-personally identifiable information (for example, your account preferences).\n      \n      \n        Why do we Need your Personal Data?\n        We do not sell any data, including your personal data. We will only collect and process your personal data in\n          accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We need to collect and process certain personal\n          data in order to provide you with access to ClickUp. If you registered with us, you will have been asked to\n          check a tick box indicating your agreement to provide this data in order to access our services. This consent\n          provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to process your data. You maintain the right\n          to withdraw such consent at any time.\n\n        Information we collect automatically when you use the Services:\n          We collect information about you when you use our Services, such as browsing our websites and taking certain\n          actions within the Services, including:\n        \n          Your use of the Services: We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with\n            any of our Services. This information includes the features you use; the tasks, projects, teams and other\n            links you click on; the type, size and filenames of attachments you upload to the Services; frequently used\n            search terms; and how you interact with others on the Services. We also collect information about the teams\n            and people you work with and how you interact with them, like who you collaborate and communicate with most\n            frequently.\n          \n          Device and Connection Information: We collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other\n            devices you use to access the Services. This device information includes your connection type and settings\n            when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We also collect information through your device about\n            your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash\n            data. We use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you\n            with a better Service experience. How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings\n            of the device you use to access the Services.\n          Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: ClickUp and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and\n            analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and\n            pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices. For more\n            information, please see our Cookies and Tracking policy, which includes information\n            on how to control or opt out of these cookies and tracking technologies.\n          Log files: We collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files, which record\n            data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving\n            the use of the ClickUp Service. This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the ClickUp\n            Service, to monitor the use of the ClickUp Service, and to gather general demographic information. We may\n            link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes, such as\n            personalizing your experience on the ClickUp Service, and evaluating the ClickUp Service in general.\n        \n        \n        Information we receive from other sources\n          We receive information about you from other Service users, from third party services, and from our business\n          and channel partners.\n        \n          Other users of the Services: Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they\n            submit content through the Services. For example, you may be mentioned by someone else on a task, or a team\n            member may upload content about you to ClickUp. We also receive your email address from other Service users\n            when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services. Similarly, an administrator may provide your\n            contact information when they designate you as another administrator for a task, team or an Enterprise or\n            Unlimited Account.\n          Other services you link to your account: We receive information about you when you or your administrator\n            enable third-party apps or integrate or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, you or\n            your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to\n            access, store, share and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services. For example, you may\n            authorize our Services to access and display files from a third-party document-sharing service within the\n            Services interface. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party\n            service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You\n            should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data\n            may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.\n          Other partners: We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from\n            third-party partners, such as advertising and market research partners who provide us with information about\n            your interest in, and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements, or in cases where you give\n            such third parties permission to share information with us or where the information is publicly available\n            online or through your device or browser data.\n          ClickUp's use of information received, and ClickUp's transfer of information to any other app, from Google\n            APIs will adhere to Google's API Services User Data\n              Policy, including the Limited Use Requirements.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        Your Rights\n        Where and when is information collected?\n          Opt-out: You may contact us anytime to opt-out of: (i) direct marketing communications; (ii) automated\n          decision-making and/or profiling; (iii) our collection of sensitive personal data, if any; or (iv) any new\n          processing of your personal data that we may carry out beyond the original purpose. Please note that your use\n          of some of the platform may be ineffective upon opt-out. \n          Access: You may access the data we hold about you at any time by exporting your Team\u2019s data (if you are an\n          admin) or by contacting us directly. \n          Amend: You can also contact us to update or correct any inaccuracies in your personal data.\n          \n          Move: Your data is portable \u2013 i.e. you have the flexibility to move your data to other service providers as\n          you wish.\n          Erase and Forget: In certain situations, for example when the data we hold about you is no longer relevant or\n          is incorrect, you can request that we erase your data.\n          \n          You may contact us at help@clickup.com or via mail or courier 350 Tenth Ave 5th floor, San Diego, CA 92101\n          anytime for any other questions you may have about your personal data and our use of such personal data.\n        \n      \n      \n        Where will Data be Transferred?\n        Your data, including personal data that we collect from you, may be transferred to, stored at and processed\n          by us and other third parties outside the country in which you reside, including, but not limited to the\n          United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in\n          other parts of the world. By using our platform, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing subject to\n          the terms of our Data Protection Addendum. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your\n          data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy. Except as otherwise provided in our Data\n          Protection Addendum, your team's project and task data will never be transferred to third parties. The only\n          data we share with third parties is for analytics, error tracking, and marketing.\n      \n      \n        How Long will Data be Stored?\n        We will only retain your personal data as long as reasonably required for you to use the Site/Application(s)\n          and/or to provide you with the Services unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for\n          example, for regulatory purposes).\n      \n      \n        Do we Collect Information from Children under 16 years of age?\n        We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The ClickUp Service is not designed for or directed\n          to children under the age of 16.

We may also use your\n          information to send other e-mail communication related to the ClickUp website and to give you the option to\n          reactivate an inactive account. When required, we will always give you the option to unsubscribe in any email\n          we send you.\n        We may also use the information gathered to perform statistical analysis of user behavior or to evaluate and\n          improve the ClickUp Service.

We may disclose\n          personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing\n          this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating\n          our Terms of Service, to detect fraud, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, the ClickUp\n          Service or the general public. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade\n          Commission (FTC).\n        \n        We also may be required to disclose an individual\u2019s personal information in response to a lawful request by\n          public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n\n        Outside Contractors\n          We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, \"Outside Contractors\") to provide\n          specific services and products related to the ClickUp Service, such as hosting, credit card processing and\n          fraud screening, and mailing list hosting for the ClickUp Service.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, \"Corporate Affiliate\" means any person or entity which\n          directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with ClickUp, whether by\n          ownership or otherwise.

This\n          Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the ClickUp Service.\n        \n\n        Is the information collected through the ClickUp Service secure?\n          We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial\n          procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your\n          information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In\n          addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. If applicable law\n          imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personally identifiable information, you agree that\n          intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.
