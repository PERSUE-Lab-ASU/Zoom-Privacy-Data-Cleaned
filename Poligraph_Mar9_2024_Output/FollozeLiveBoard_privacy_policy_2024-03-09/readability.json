For example, metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of user content was collected. Google Analytics helps us understand how users use our Services by collecting information sent by your browser, including your IP address, and utilizing cookies. Google Analytics receives and stores information generated by your browser or device about your use of the Services and their use of the information is governed by their privacy policy.

These analytics may in some circumstances be associated with your Personally Identifiable Information so that users know who is interested in their content.

The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these vendors, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services.
