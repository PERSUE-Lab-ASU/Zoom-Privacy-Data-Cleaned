<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACH Processing – Fitli has integrated ACH processing into our product, and each merchant can choose to activate ACH, allowing their customers to add a bank account and pay for products and services via ACH.&nbsp; There is a monthly subscription fee of $5 to unlock this capability.</span></p>

<li>ARBITRATION / CLASS ACTION WAIVER</li>
</ol>
<p>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE.</p>
<p>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
<p>You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</p>
<p>You and Fitli must abide by the following rules: (1) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR FITLI MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTYS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSONS CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Fitli will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (4) Fitli also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (6) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (7) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (8) each side pays its own attorney’s fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Fitli may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. To the extent possible, such claims shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Douglas County, Colorado. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in Douglas County, Colorado in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Douglas County, Colorado for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</p>
<p>With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) in this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (1) or (2) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Fitli shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in Douglas County, Colorado.</p>

This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.</p>
<p>We may also send transaction-related communications such as welcome emails, order confirmations, and payment transaction notices. You expressly agree to receive this information. We may from time to time send you marketing or promotional communications, unless you elect to opt out of receiving such information. You can discontinue future promotional communications by following the specific unsubscribe instructions in the communications you receive.</p>
<p>Representatives of Fitli may access the information in your account from time to time&nbsp;in order to identify opportunities to improve your use of the system and to provide requested support to you or your clients.</p>
<p>Technologies used to capture data</p>
<p>When you interact with fitli, our overarching goal is to deliver a great experience. With that in mind, we may use certain technologies to help achieve that goal. These technologies come in many different forms including cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects, advertising identifiers, and similar technologies. We and third parties we partner with may use any of the above to help achieve the overall goal of a great customer experience. Additionally, mobile applications may use technologies available within your mobile device, such as location inputs, GPS, Wi-Fi, operating system, or other pertinent data sources available on your specific mobile device(s). Analytic software may be used to capture or analyze navigation, search, purchase, operating system, and location information.</p>
<p>Third parties</p>
<p>We may share your information with third party organizations which have contracted with Fitli to provide a service such as financial, payment processing, analytic, email, or other supporting services. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, rent, or share your information to third parties or otherwise disclose the information you have entrusted with Fitli with any organization not contracted with fitli.</p>
<p>Business Customers</p>
<p>We may share information about you (such as age or gender) and your use of the service with businesses customers contracted with fitli. In certain cases, you may be able to adjust your settings to increase or decrease the amount of information we share. Note that businesses will be able to see your public information and receive information about your transactions with them, regardless of settings.</p>
<p>Links</p>
<p>The service may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. We do not determine, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these other sites.</p>
<p>Cooperation with law enforcement</p>
<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose information about you in response to legal process (such as warrants and subpoenas) if we have a good faith belief that such disclosures are reasonably necessary to comply with legal requirements, to protect the safety of a person or the public, to stop activities that we may consider illegal, unethical, or harmful, or to protect our rights, reputation, or property and that of our customers, affiliates, or the public.</p>
<p>Social Media</p>
<p>We may integrate the service with social sharing features or other similar tools that let you share your actions. These features may enable sharing information with your friends or the public, depending on settings you establish with the social sharing service. Your actions with these social media are governed by the privacy policy of the relevant platform.</p>
<p>Public posts</p>
<p>The service may allow you to post or share content to a public area of the service (such as public profile, reviews, or similar). Be aware that any content or information you choose to disclose in these areas can be read, collected, and used by other users, the general public, and other services. We are not responsible for, and this policy does not cover, the privacy of information you choose to share in these areas.</p>
<p>Data retention and account termination</p>
<p>We typically retain information you provide us for as long as you are registered to use the service, and for a reasonable period of time thereafter. If you want your account closed, please contact us at support@fitli.com. Note that any public posts made by a user (such as business reviews) may be retained indefinitely. We may also retain information about users for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act effective as of April 21, 2000 regarding the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. The service is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 13, and we will not knowingly collect information from such persons. Any person who provides information to us through registration or in any other manner on the Site represents that they are 13 years of age or older. If we learn that a child under 13 has submitted personal information to us, we will delete the information as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>We take protection of your Personal Information very seriously and make commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access. We cannot guarantee, however, that our security measures will completely prevent unauthorized third parties from obtaining and using your personal information for improper purposes. You must keep secret any username or password which is registered in connection with your use of the service.</p>
<p>Changing or deleting your data</p>
<p>In many cases, information you enter into the service can be edited from the same screen. However, if you desire to have us delete any of your personal information or data please contact us at privacy@fitli.com and specify what you would like us to change or remove. We will affect the change or deletion within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>International data transfer</p>
<p>Our principal offices and data storage facilities are located in the United States. If you use the service from any country outside of the United States, it is likely that any data you provide us will be transferred outside your country of origin. By using the service, you provide express consent to having your data transferred to and stored in the United States.</p>
<p>Changes to the policy</p>
<p>If we make any changes to this policy, we will notify customers of the change either via a prominent message on the Fitli website or via an email message sent to your email on file. Your continued use of the service from the effective date of changes constitutes your agreement to be bound by any changes to this policy.</p>
