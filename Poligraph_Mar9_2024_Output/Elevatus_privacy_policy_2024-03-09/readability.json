For example, these pipelines may be hiring pipelines with different stages where automation occurs by defining how movement between stages in the pipeline occurs. You may perhaps create the automation logic for a stage in the pipeline for document submission where you may request Applicants to submit a specific document. Upon successful completion by the Applicant, they are automatically moved to the next stage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an Applicant, then by registering to a Company\u2019s portal your data will be processed according to the Company\u2019s definitions and purpose. Nevertheless, we assert that any Company cannot use artificial intelligence technologies during decision-making stages as they are meant to be used responsibly and human involvement and participation is required when autonomous decisions are made.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Data We Collect for AI</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You (the Company or the Applicant) create your Elevatus profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Products).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our products require certain information to perform predictions and to learn and improve, and for that we encourage sharing more information as long as it is restricted to our Legitimate Interests.

It is crucial to note that we do not create these pipelines nor determine the motives or grounds for their use in any particular way.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you are a registered entity (\u201cCompany\u201d) then you may use our Platform to define a multitude of pipelines, questionnaires, templates and the associated logic for (\u201cApplicants\u201d) to undergo for various purposes of your own determination. For example, these pipelines may be hiring pipelines with different stages where automation occurs by defining how movement between stages in the pipeline occurs. You may perhaps create the automation logic for a stage in the pipeline for document submission where you may request Applicants to submit a specific document. Upon successful completion by the Applicant, they are automatically moved to the next stage.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you are an Applicant, then by registering to a Company\u2019s portal your data will be processed according to the Company\u2019s definitions and purpose.

Insights are drawn from the answers and the Applicant is given a choice upon completion to either answer a psychometric test or to skip. A personality report is generated and shared with the Company. This report is intended to guide and not discriminate against the Applicant and does fall into any automated decision making process, but instead, is divorced from it.\n\n\n\nEVA-REC (Recruitment Module)\n\n\n\nEVA-REC is a bundle of products and services that are carefully designed to solve the hiring cycle (or a similarly defined process).\n\n\n\nEVA-BRAND (Company Branding)\n\n\n\nEVA-BRAND is the Company\u2019s way to showcase its culture and team atmosphere to an Applicant.
