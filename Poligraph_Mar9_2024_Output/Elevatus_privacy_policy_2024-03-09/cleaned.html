<h4 class="wp-block-heading">When Elevatus is a Data Controller</h4>



<p>We are a Controller when it comes to processing your data for our own purpose of improving our technologies and business by analyzing your data and/or training artificially intelligent algorithms.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">As an Applicant</h5>



<p>As an Applicant, these data may involve pseudonymized postings and applications, videos you record and content such as extracted speech and text. These data are utilized for the only purpose of improving our learning algorithms to yield a better, less biased experience of our platform.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">As a Company or Applicant</h5>



<p>Your data may be used to feed our ontology and our algorithms in order to allow us to serve powerful recommendations to you in the form of suggestions and recommendations, making the system smarter as a whole and the process more efficient.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">When Elevatus is a Data Processor</h4>



<p>We are a Processor when it comes to storing, managing and serving your data on your behalf as part of our Contractual obligations to you, consent given by you, or as part of legitimate interests.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">As an Applicant</h5>



<p>We process your information for the Company (the Controller) that you register to. The data we collect and process are your personal information pertaining to the purpose entailed and defined by the Company. The Company entrusts us to process your data.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">As a Company</h5>



<p>We are your data processor and we process your information and the Applicant’s information on your behalf.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Data we Collect</h3>



<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>



<p>Upon signing up as a “<strong>User</strong>”, you are required to enter your identification information such as your first name, last name, company name, email address, and an encrypted password (which is unknown to us). You are then directed accordingly to the purpose of your registration. If you are a registered entity (“<strong>Company</strong>”), then you are directed towards the Company profile builder, upon which you may be required to disclose more information about your Company.</p>



<p>If you are a person (“<strong>Applicant</strong>”), upon signing up, you are required to enter your first name, last name, email address, and an encrypted password. You may share your phone number if you choose – in some regions you may be required to. Afterwards, you are directed to the Applicant profile builder, upon which you may provide data not limited to your educational background, work experience, achievements and a video CV where you may present yourself. These will be visible in your profile to those who have a link to your profile, namely the Company on whose career portal you have signed up.</p>



<p><strong>Assessments</strong></p>



<p>As an Applicant, during video-based assessments and interviews, we collect and store data consisting of your videos and your details when you register for the assessment such as your email address and name. These data are important to identify you to the Company that invited you to the assessment.</p>



<p>As a Company, we save all data pertaining to managing and evaluating applicants to your video assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tracking System</strong></p>



<p>As an Applicant, you may be processed through a tracking system with custom made pipelines and automation rules defined by the Company. We track your progress through the system and keep your data safe and secure. Data that may be stored could, for example, be private or confidential documents that need to be submitted to the Company as per their requirements.</p>



<p>As a Company, we save all data pertaining to the tracking of applicants through your own customized templates, questionnaires and pipelines.</p>



<p><strong>Branding</strong></p>



<p>As a Company, we store all data you use to edit and customize the branding of your portal. Data included could be photos of team members, videos that may showcase the culture and image of your company, social media links.</p>



<p><strong>Interviews and Video Meetings</strong></p>



<p>As an Applicant or a Company, any video recorded or uploaded to the platform will be saved and stored securely on our servers.</p>



<p><strong>Automated Hiring Pipelines</strong></p>



<p>We provide the capability to easily define automated hiring pipelines. It is crucial to note that we do not create these pipelines nor determine the motives or grounds for their use in any particular way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are a registered entity (“Company”) then you may use our Platform to define a multitude of pipelines, questionnaires, templates and the associated logic for (“Applicants”) to undergo for various purposes of your own determination. For example, these pipelines may be hiring pipelines with different stages where automation occurs by defining how movement between stages in the pipeline occurs. You may perhaps create the automation logic for a stage in the pipeline for document submission where you may request Applicants to submit a specific document. Upon successful completion by the Applicant, they are automatically moved to the next stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are an Applicant, then by registering to a Company’s portal your data will be processed according to the Company’s definitions and purpose. Nevertheless, we assert that any Company cannot use artificial intelligence technologies during decision-making stages as they are meant to be used responsibly and human involvement and participation is required when autonomous decisions are made.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Data We Collect for AI</h3>



<p>You (the Company or the Applicant) create your Elevatus profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Products).</p>



<p>Our products require certain information to perform predictions and to learn and improve, and for that we encourage sharing more information as long as it is restricted to our Legitimate Interests. However, for the training, improvement or enhancement of our products, all information, commonly referred to as “Personally-Identifiable Information”, ”<strong>PII</strong>” or ”<strong>PII-data</strong>” such as your first and last name, your email, and phone number are excluded automatically from any automated or artificial learning, improvement or enhancement. We attempt to use all other data such as, your skills or previous job titles and achievements as anonymized data for machine learning purposes and technological enhancement.</p>
