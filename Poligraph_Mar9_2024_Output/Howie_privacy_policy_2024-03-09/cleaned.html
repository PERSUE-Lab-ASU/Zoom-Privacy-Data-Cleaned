<h2 id="information-we-collect-about-you-and-how-we-collect-it">Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It</h2>
<p>We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Website.</p>
<p>We collect several types of information from and about Users, Invitees and Viewers of our Website, including information:</p>
<ul>
<li>By which you may be personally identified, such as name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other identifier by which you may be contacted online or offline ("<strong>personal information</strong>");</li>
<li>That is about you but individually does not identify you; and/or</li>
<li>About your internet connection, the equipment you use to access our Website, and usage details.</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly from you when you provide it to us.</li>
<li>Automatically as you navigate through the site. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information-you-provide-to-us">Information You Provide to Us.</h2>
<p>The information we collect on or through our Website may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our Website. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our Website, subscribing to our service, posting material, or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our Website.</li>
<li>Records and copies of your correspondence (including email addresses), if you contact us.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect the following information, either directly from Users, Invitees, or Viewers, or through third parties regarding Users, Invitees, or Viewers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Appointment Information.</u> A User may voluntarily give us certain information when scheduling and setting up appointments.
This can include name, email address, phone number; email addresses of other people and/or Invitees; the subject of the
meeting; and any other information a User provides or collects upon scheduling, pursuant to the Howie Terms of Use or an
executed agreement with Howie. Howie processes the information an Invitee provides to a User when scheduling with the User
on the User’s behalf as a processor or service provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Calendar Information.</u> A User may connect their calendar with Howie. In most instances, our calendar integration
only uses and displays the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when
you’re busy. A few of our features also use and display the meeting titles in your calendar. In all cases, however, no
details about the appointments in your connected calendar are stored in Howie, such as who you are meeting with, their
email address, or the meeting title. Although connecting your calendar to our services makes the scheduling process much
more efficient, you are not required to connect your calendar to use our services. Howie processes the calendar information
on the User’s behalf as a processor or service provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Information Received from Third Parties.</u> If you choose to connect your account to your account with a third-party
service, we may receive or be granted access to information from such third-party service, including Personal Information.
You can stop sharing your information from a third-party service with us by removing our access to that service. Howie
processes that information on the User’s behalf as a processor or service provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Account and Billing Information.</u> Users provide Howie with certain information, including name, email address, username,
and password, when you set up your account. If you purchase a premium version of Howie, our third party payment processors
will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card
number, card type, and the expiration date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Chatbot Data.</u> If you engage with our virtual chatbot, we will collect the information you provide during the chat,
including transcripts of your conversation with the chatbot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Marketing Information.</u> Users, Invitees, or Viewers interested in Howie’s services may contact us through forms made
available on the Website and voluntarily give information such as name, work email, phone number, company, and role. Users,
Invitees, or Viewers interested in our newsletter may also submit their name and email addresses to join our mailing list.
We also receive other similar information provided by you if you participate in an event hosted by Howie or its partners
(such as webinars) and in your interactions with our social media accounts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, <strong>"posted"</strong>) on public areas of the Website, or transmitted to other users of the Website or third parties (collectively, <strong>"User Contributions"</strong>). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Although you may set certain privacy settings for such information by logging into your account profile, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.</p>
