Information We Collect</h4>\n<p>1.1. IR collects Personal Data and Non-Personal Data from you when you visit our website, when you send us information or communications, and when you download and use our Services.</p>\n<p>1.2. <strong>Personal Data</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>We collect Personal Data from you. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is an individual who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</li>\n<li>We only collect Personal Data that is necessary, relevant, and limited in relation to the Services we are providing to you. We only collect and store Personal Data that is provided by you or that you have given us permission to read from your system. We do not generate or collect additional Personal Data outside of what you provide. For example, we read an email address as an identifier, e.g. person@company.com, but we do not allow the addition of a natural language name unless that explicitly exists in the customer system, e.g. John Doe, and our system has been configured by you to read that name.</li>\n<li>Like most internet services, we automatically gather data about you or your device browser including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request. We store this information in log files each time you visit our website or access your account on our network. This data allows you a better experience using our Services.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>1.3. <strong>Non-Personal Data</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anonymous Data</strong><br>To make our website and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect \u201cAnonymous Data\u201d from you, such as browser type, operating system, domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. Anonymous Data has all Personal Data references removed such that the data cannot be reverse engineered or in any way attributed to the individual from which the information was collected. Anonymous Data collected by IR includes information about the date and time of the anonymous user\u2019s visit and about how they have used our Services.</li>\n<li><strong>Application Data</strong><br>IR collects Application Data when our products are deployed in your IT environment. \u201cApplication Data\u201d means data about the performance of your application, system data (such as version data, names of plug-ins, etc.) about the environment in which your application is operating, data about transactions being monitored by our Services, stack traces and source code snippets for certain classes of errors, and other similar data related to your application. Only data that is relevant to the Services you have purchased from IR will be collected.<p>Some Services may collect messages being sent and received from your Contact Centre so that we can convey those messages to and from carrier networks. Similarly, to transmit voice calls to and from the telecommunications carrier networks, we collect the voice communications being sent and received to route them appropriately. You can also use our Services to record voice communications or have them transcribed, in which case, we will also collect those voice recordings or transcriptions.</p></li>\n<li><strong>Information from Children</strong><br>We neither direct or target our Services to, nor do we intentionally collect Personal Data from, children who are under the age of 16. Further, we request that these individuals do not provide Personal Data through our Services. If we find that an individual under the age of 16 has created an account with us, we may disable that account or seek to have a parent or guardian provide consent for the child\u2019s account.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal Health Information and Sensitive Information</strong><br>IR\u2019s Services are not intended for, and you shall not use them to receive, send or otherwise process Personal Health Information (PHI) as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (HIPAA) or any sensitive Personal Data (e.g. information related to racial or ethnic origin, health or health records, political opinions, religion, or criminal background), unless otherwise provided in your written agreements with IR.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>2.

Third parties, with whom we partner to provide these features on our website, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2.4. <strong>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</strong><br>Please note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal to websites and online services you visit to disable the tracking of an individual user.

These features may collect your IP address, which pages you are visiting on our website, and may set Cookies to enable the feature to function properly.
