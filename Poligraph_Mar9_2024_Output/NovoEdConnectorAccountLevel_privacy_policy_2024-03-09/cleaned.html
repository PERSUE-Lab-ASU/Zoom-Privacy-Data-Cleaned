<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-data-do-we-collect">What data do we collect?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Personal data</strong></h3>



<p>“Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.&nbsp; We collect Personal Data from two categories of users of the Services:&nbsp; a) Administrators and Instructors for entities that contract with us or that might be interested in contracting with us or those we market to and who answer our inquiries (“Customers”), b) Persons (“Learners”) that our Customers desire to use our Services to provide learning and training. If you are using NovoEd’s website to take sample courses on behalf of a Customer, we treat you as falling under category (b) and are treated as such with respect to our Privacy Policy. &nbsp;When referred together, Learners and Customers are “Users”.</p>



<p>For Customers, we will collect Personal Data such as the names, customer ID, e-mail addresses, name of the entity they represent, phone numbers, and their IP Addresses.&nbsp; We also will collect and post content for Users in connection with the Service such as articles, checklists and courses (“Courses”).</p>



<p>For Learners, we collect Personal Data such as names, usernames, and email addresses.&nbsp; We also collect Learner IP addresses, names, emails, locations (country, state, city), school name or employer name; if applicable. We also collect a history of the Course(s) taken and completion of course activities and whether they logged in to view the course(s) (“Course History”).&nbsp;&nbsp; Learners may also submit content to share with other Learners or with Customers and instructors. The Courses have social tools such as discussions to allow Learners to interact and learn from each other.&nbsp; These discussions are logged.</p>



<p>If NovoEd offers you Courses under its own name (via this Site, for example), we treat you as a Learner and offer you the same rights as described in this policy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracking data</strong></h3>



<p>We and our third-party service providers may collect certain tracking information about your use of our Site and Service.&nbsp; For example, we collect:</p>



<ul>
<li>Google Analytics: as User uses the app; tracking user clicking behavior; session length, device used, and estimation of country of origin based on IP address.</li>



<li>Log information (including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring and exit pages, operating system, dates/time of access, pages visited, and time spent on those pages and related data)</li>



<li>Information collected by cookies</li>



<li>Web beacons (also called “Internet tags” or “clear gifs”; used to count visitors to our Site and which pages were viewed and links clicked)</li>



<li>Embedded scripts (code temporarily downloaded onto your device to collect information about your interactions with the Service and thereafter deleted or deactivated)</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>



<p>When you visit our Site we use cookies, or similar technologies like single-pixel gifs to record log data.&nbsp; We use both session-based and persistent cookies.&nbsp; Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser.&nbsp; Session cookies are used to track the session and remember you so you don’t need to sign in every time. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.&nbsp; They are unique and allow us to do site analytics and customization, among other things.&nbsp; If you access our Site through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Law enforcement and internal operations</strong></h3>



<p>Personal Data may be provided where we are required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary (i) to respond to claims asserted against Company or to comply with a legal process (for example, discovery requests, subpoenas or warrants); (ii) to enforce or administer our policies and agreements with Users; (iii) for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, product development and debugging purposes; or (iv) to protect the rights, property or safety of Company, its Users or members of the general public.&nbsp; We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Users about law enforcement or court ordered requests for data unless otherwise prohibited by law.&nbsp; However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to any third-party request to compel disclosure of your information.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="third-party-service-providers"><strong>Third parties service providers</strong></h2>



<p>We contract with other companies to perform functions or services for us.&nbsp; Our categories of service providers include software maintenance, security testing, data hosting, sending email messages, project management and customer service.&nbsp; We necessarily have to share your Personal Data with such third parties as required so that they can perform their functions.&nbsp; We take steps to ensure that these parties take protecting your privacy as seriously as we do, including entering into Data Processing Addendum(s), EU Model Clauses and/or ensuring they have EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification since all of our service providers are in the United States.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-my-data-protected">How is my data protected?</h2>



<p>We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration. For example:</p>



<ul>

<li>Data is kept on secure servers located in the US. Access to this data is controlled using RSA key pairs and AWS security groups; and limited to only a few Company employees.</li>

<li>Restricting staff access to Personal Data on a need to know basis with access monitored by logs.</li>



<li>Regular staff privacy and security training.</li>



<li>Third party Penetration testing.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we store, process or transmit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-choices">Your choices:</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Data subject rights for learners: NovoEd is only a processor of your personal data.</strong></h3>



<p>NovoEd provides a learning platform for our Customers.&nbsp; We process data at our Customer’s direction and the Customers are the controllers of the Personal Data of Learners who enroll in their courses.&nbsp; Customers use our tools to decide what Learner information is tracked and determine the purpose for which Learner Personal Data is collected.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a Learner accessing the Services to take Courses from a Customer and are located in the European Economic Area and would like to exercise any of your Data Subject Rights listed below, please contact the Customer whose Course you enrolled in directly.</p>
