(\u201c<strong> Complily</strong>,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.complily.com/\">https://www.complily.com/</a>, \u201c<strong>us</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>we</strong>,\u201d or \u201c<strong>our</strong>\u201d) thanks you for visiting the <strong>online and mobile resources </strong>we publish. We use the words \u201c<strong>you</strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>your</strong>\u201d   to mean you, the reader, and other visitors to our online and mobile   resources who are, in all cases, over the age of 13. Our privacy   statement (\u201c<strong>this statemen</strong>t,\u201d \u201c<strong>this privacy statement</strong>,\u201d and \u201c<strong>our statement</strong>\u201d)   informs you about from whom and the types of personal information we   collect, how we use it, who we share it with and why, and what we do to   try to protect it.</p>\n<p><strong>Online and mobile resources </strong>mean the websites and   other internet features we own that allow you to interact with our   websites, as well apps we\u2019ve created and distributed to let our   customers and followers view our online and mobile resources or   otherwise interact with the content we provide.</p>\n<p><strong>WHO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM</strong><br>\n  We may   collect personal information from the following groups of data subjects:   visitors to, and users of, our online and mobile resources; our   customers; current members of our workforce and those who apply for   posted jobs; and third-party vendors and business partners.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal information </strong>generally means information   that can be used to identify you or that can be easily linked to you   (for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address,   social security number and date of birth). The privacy laws in some   jurisdictions include unique elements in what they consider to be the   personal information of the consumers or data subjects they protect. If   those laws apply to us, as in the case of the California Consumer   Privacy Act (\u201c<strong>CCPA</strong>\u201d) or European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201c<strong>GDPR</strong>\u201d), our use of the phrase \u201cpersonal information\u201d includes the unique elements required by such laws.<br>\n  The   categories of information we collect from each of these groups, and the   ways in which we use it, differs. As you may have noticed, it\u2019s   possible that the same person could fall into more than one group. Most   of this statement addresses our processing and sharing of personal   information collected from visitors to and users of our online and   mobile resources and our customers.<br>\n  Nonetheless<strong>, </strong>we collect and retain the types of <strong>professional or employment related personal information </strong>you   would expect an employer to have about its existing and former   workforce and new job applicants. We provide legally required notices of   collection and describe our use and sharing of the personal information   of our workforce and applicants in greater detail in confidential   internal human resource manuals and documents accessible to members of   our workforce, or by publication on the proprietary workforce/applicant   portals and apps we operate. In some cases, such portals and apps may be   operated by third parties who transfer the personal information to us.   In those situations, the legal responsibility to provide notice usually   rests with the third party, not us.</p>\n<p>In addition, like all corporate enterprises, we buy goods and   services, lease equipment and office space and attend industry events.   In doing so, we interact with many existing and potential <strong>vendors and business partners </strong>from   whom we necessarily collect certain personal information in connection   with our contractual and business relationships. As with our customers,   this information is typically limited to minimum business contact   information. We use and share personal information collected from our   vendors and business partners to manage, administer and perform under   our contracts with them, or share information about our products. We   describe our use of vendor and business partner personal information in   greater detail in our confidential contracts with those parties or on   the internal vendor management portals we operate.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT WE COLLECT</strong><br>\n  There are two types of   information that we obtain from you online and then store and use: (i)   non-personal information that\u2019s collected automatically from each   visitor, such as your device operating system; and (ii) personal   information that you voluntarily provide to us or that is collected   automatically.</p>\n<p><strong><em>By using our online and mobile resources or purchasing   our products or services, you are signifying to us that you agree with   this section of our privacy statement and that we may use and disclose   your information as described</em></strong>.<br>\n  <em><u>Voluntarily Submitted Information</u></em><em>.</em></p>\n<p>If you participate in certain activities via our online and mobile   resources, you may be asked to provide us with information about   yourself. The types of personal information we collect in those   situations includes <strong>identifiers </strong>(such as your name, email address, physical address, and phone number), <strong>professional information </strong>(such as the business you are in), and <strong>financial account information </strong>(such   as your credit card information). We do not sell, rent, or trade   voluntarily submitted personal information with third parties.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want us to collect this type of personal information,   please don\u2019t provide it. This means you shouldn\u2019t participate in the   activities on our online and mobile resources that request or require it   and you may want to communicate with us by phone or regular mail   instead. Participation is strictly your choice. Not participating may   limit your ability to take full advantage of the online and mobile   resources, but it will not affect your ability to access certain   information available to the general public on the online and mobile   resources.</p>\n<p>Some of the ways you voluntarily give us your personal information and how we use it:</p>\n<p><strong>Emails and Online Forms \u2013 </strong>When you send us an email   or fill out an online form, such as to contact us, your email address   and any other personal information (e.g., home address or phone number)   that may be in the content of your message or attached to it, are   retained by us and used to respond back directly to you and to process   your request. Depending on the personal information provided,   communications from us may be in the form of emails, telephone calls,   and/or text messages. We may also send you information about any of our   products or services we think may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Registering for an Account \u2013 </strong>When you register for   an account or you register your child for a sub-account, you submit   personal information to us such as your name and email address (or your   child\u2019s name and email address) which we then retain. We use that   information to create and manage your account and, in some cases,   establish a password and profile to communicate with you and any   sub-accounts you created via email.</p>\n<p><strong>Registering for Events \u2013 </strong>When you register for   services, webinars, events, conferences, or programs we ourselves may   host (rather than outsource to a third-party event manager with its own   privacy policies), you will be submitting the types of identifiers   described above. If the event requires a fee, we may also ask you to   submit <strong>credit card or other financial information</strong>. We use this information to register you for the event and send you communications regarding the event.</p>\n<p><strong>Becoming a Subscriber to Our Service \u2013 </strong>We use any   information provided from our customers to perform our contractual   obligations and provide the products and services purchased to them, to   manage their accounts and communicate with them.<br>\n  <strong>Social Media and Community Features \u2013 </strong>Some   of our online and mobile resources may offer social media-like   community features letting users post messages and comments, and/or   upload an image or other files and materials. If you choose to make use   of these features, the information you post, including your screen name   and any other personal information, will be in the public domain and <strong>not covered/protected by this statement</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>A<u>utomatically Collected Information</u>.</em></p>\n<p>When you visit our online and mobile resources, basic information is   passively collected through your web browser via use of tracking   technologies, such as a \u201ccookie\u201d which is a small text file that is   downloaded onto your computer or mobile device when you access the   online and mobile resources. It allows us to recognize your computer or   mobile device and store some information about your preferences or past   actions.</p>\n<p>We allow third party vendors to use cookies or similar technologies   to collect information about your browsing activities over time   following your use of the site. For example, we use Google Analytics, a   web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (\u201c<strong>Google</strong>\u201c).   Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how you use the online   and mobile resources and enhance your experience when you visit the   online and mobile resources. For more information on how Google uses   this data, go to <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites\">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>. You can learn more about how to opt out of Google Analytics by going to <a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>\n<p>The internet activity information collected through cookies and other   similar means includes such things as: the domain name and IP address   from which you accessed our online and mobile resources; the type of   browser and operating system you use; the date and time and length of   your visit; the specific page visited, graphics viewed and any documents   downloaded; the specific links to other sites you accessed from our   online and mobile resources; and the specific links from other sites you   used to access our online and mobile resources.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you access our online and mobile resources from a   phone or other mobile device, the mobile services provider may transmit   to us uniquely identifiable mobile device information which allows us to   then collect mobile phone numbers and associate them with the mobile   device identification information. Some mobile phone vendors also   operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices and we   may receive this information as well if location services are enabled on   your device. If you do not want us to collect and use <strong>geolocation data</strong>, disable location services through your device settings.</p>\n<p>Regardless, we use both automatically collected information and   mobile device information to compile generic reports about popular pages   on our online and mobile resources, and to see how our customers and   followers are accessing our online and mobile resources. We then use   that data to administer the online and mobile resources and make them   better, make your activities more convenient and efficient and to   enhance the functionality of our online and mobile resources, such as by   remembering certain of your information in order to save you time.</p>\n<p>We use and retain your personal information in accordance with   applicable law and as long as necessary to carry out the purposes   described above in accordance with our internal data retention   procedures.</p>\n<p><em><u>User Beware: External Sites, Apps, Links and Social Media</u></em><em>.</em></p>\n<p>We maintain a presence on one or more external social media platforms   such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn. We may further allow   features of our online and mobile resources to connect with, or be   viewable from, that external social media presence. Similarly, our   online and mobile resources may contain links to other websites or apps   controlled by third parties.</p>\n<p>We are not responsible for either the content on, or the privacy   practices of, social media platforms, or any third-party sites or apps   to which we link. Those apps, sites and platforms are not controlled by   us and therefore have their own privacy policies and terms of use. If   you have questions about how those apps, sites and platforms collect and   use personal information, you should carefully read their privacy   policies and contact them using the information they provide.</p>\n<p><strong>WHEN/WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>We use non-personal information to administer our online and mobile   resources, make them better, and to make business decisions about what   programs our customers might like.</p>\n<p>We use voluntarily provided personal information to respond to your   inquiries and provide you with the services you have requested, amongst   other uses as further described below. We do not sell or rent your   personal information to third party data vendors or marketing companies.   As you might expect, we disclose your information when required by law.</p>\n<p><em><u>Affiliates</u></em><em>.</em><br>\n  In addition to those third   parties set forth above, we may share your information, including   personal information, within our family of companies including but not   limited to  Complily. Those companies will use such information in generally   the same manner as we do under this privacy statement which includes   sending you information about their products, services, or initiatives   that may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p><em><u>Legally Compelled Disclosures</u></em>.<br>\n  We may disclose   your information, including personal information, to government   authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by such   government authorities, or at our discretion or otherwise as required or   permitted by law, including but not limited to responding to court   orders and subpoenas.</p>\n<p><em><u>To Prevent Harm</u></em><em>.</em><br>\n  We may disclose your   information, including personal information, when we have reason to   believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our   rights or property, other users of the online and mobile resources, or   anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>\n<p><em><u>Business Transfer</u></em><em>.</em><br>\n  If we or any of our   affiliates, or substantially all of its or their assets, are acquired by   one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale,   reorganization, consolidation, or liquidation, personal information may   be one of the transferred assets.</p>\n<p><em><u>Vendors and Business Partners</u></em><em>.</em><br>\n  We may   share your information, including personal information, with our vendors   and other third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship.   We may also share your information, including personal information, with   vendors who provide third party software services that you have chosen   to assist you with your sales funnels. We do our best to disclose only   the information each of those parties need.</p>\n<p>We have adopted standards for those vendors and business partners who   receive personal information from us. We attempt to bind such vendors   and business partners to those standards via written contracts. We   further attempt to contractually restrict what our vendors and business   partners can do with the personal information we provide to them such   that it is used only to the extent necessary to carry out the business   purpose for which it was provided; is not disclosed to anyone else   without our consent or under our instruction; remains, as between us and   the applicable vendor or business partner, our property; and is not   transferred out of the United States without our consent.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please note, however, that we cannot guarantee that all   of our vendors and business partners will agree to these contractual   requirements; nor can we ensure that, even when they do agree, they will   always fully comply.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS AND OPTIONS</strong><br>\n  You do not have to   provide personal information to enjoy most of the features of our online   and mobile resources. Moreover, you can opt out of certain activities   like newsletters and announcements. Residents of California and data   subjects whose personal information was obtained while they were in the   GDPR Jurisdictions have certain additional rights.</p>\n<p><strong>GDPR Jurisdictions </strong>means the countries composed of   the European Economic Area (including Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Norway)   and the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,   Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,   Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,   the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain,   and Sweden.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Andorra, Argentina, Canada (only commercial   organizations), Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey,   New Zealand, Switzerland, Uruguay and Japan have received an \u201cadequacy   decision\u201d from the European Commission, adheres to the material terms of   the GDPR. Switzerland also has its own data protection via its Federal   Act of Data Protection (\u201cDPA\u201d).</p>\n<p><strong>GDPR longer has jurisdiction over The United Kingdom</strong>.   Since the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) has now formally left the European   Union, it is no longer regulated domestically by the material terms of   the GDPR.&nbsp; The United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation   (\u201cUK-GDPR\u201d) is the UK\u2019s data privacy law that governs the processing of   personal data domestically.<br>\n  If we are using personal information you   provided to us in order to enable us to send you materials, such as   newsletters or product alerts via text or email, and you decide you   don\u2019t want to receive such materials, you may opt out by following the   opt-out instructions in the email or other communication (e.g., by   responding to the text with \u201cSTOP\u201d), or by contacting us using the   contact information below.

At   this time, we do not specifically respond to browser \u201cdo not track\u201d   signals.</p>\n<p><strong>CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY</strong><br>\n  Federal law imposes special   restrictions and obligations on commercial website operators who direct   their operations toward, and collect and use information from, children   under the age of 13. We take those age-related requirements very   seriously, and consistent with it do not intend for our online and   mobile resources to be used by children under the age of 13 without   first obtaining the verifiable consent of such child\u2019s parent or legal   guardian. Moreover, we do not knowingly collect personal information   from minors under the age of 13, only a parent or legal guardian may   provide such information after adhering to our verification process for   submitting such information via the online and mobile resources. If we   become aware that anyone under the age of 18 has submitted personal   information to our online and mobile resources, we will delete that   information and will not use it for any purpose whatsoever. If you   believe that someone under the age of 18 has submitted personal   information to our online and mobile resources, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@complily.com\">support@complily.com</a>.&nbsp;   We encourage parents and legal guardians to talk with their children   about the potential risks of providing personal information over the   Internet.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW WE PROTECT COLLECTED PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>\n  We   will take all reasonable security precautions to protect your personal   information provided to our online and mobile resources. We have adopted   a security program that includes technical, organizational,   administrative, and other security measures designed to protect, in a   manner consistent with accepted industry standards and applicable law,   against anticipated or actual threats to the security of personal   information (the \u201c<strong>Security Program</strong>\u201d). We cannot,   however, guarantee that your information, whether during transmission or   while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be free from   unauthorized access or that loss, misuse, destruction, or alteration   will not occur. Except for our duty to maintain the Security Program   under applicable law, we disclaim any other liability for any such theft   or loss of, unauthorized access or damage to, or interception of any   data or communications including personal information. We have every   reason to believe our Security Program is reasonable and appropriate for   our business and the nature of foreseeable risks to the personal   information we collect. We further periodically review and update our   Security Program, including as required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, as part of our Security Program, we have specific   incident response and management procedures that are activated whenever   we become aware that your personal information was likely to have been   compromised. We further require, as part of our vendor and business   partner oversight procedures, that such parties notify us immediately if   they have any reason to believe that an incident adversely affecting   personal information, we provided to them has occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT</strong><br>\n  When we   collect personal information from California residents, we become   subject to, and those residents have rights under, the California   Consumer Privacy Act or \u201c<strong>CCPA</strong>\u201d.

We fulfill our GDPR obligations with   respect to our workforce/job applicants, our customers (and their own   end-clients), and our vendors and business partners through a series of   separate notices, contracts or other terms provided to them at the time,   and in the manner and form, GDPR and local law within each GDPR   Jurisdiction requires.</p>\n<p>We describe, in the immediately following section of this statement,   how we comply with the GDPR for personal information collected from   visitors to and users of our online and mobile resources while they were   in a GDPR Jurisdiction. Thus, for purposes of that section, the words \u201c<strong>you</strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>your</strong>\u201d mean only such GDPR Jurisdiction-based visitors and users.</p>\n<p><strong>What do we collect from you in the GDPR Jurisdictions and how do we use it?</strong><br>\n  We   collect from you the categories of personal information already   described.

We use the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d   to mean you, the reader, and other visitors to our online and mobile   resources who are, in all cases, over the age of 13. Our privacy   statement (\u201cthis statement,\u201d \u201cthis privacy statement,\u201d and \u201cour statement\u201d)   informs you about from whom and the types of personal information we   collect, how we use it, who we share it with and why, and what we do to   try to protect it.\nOnline and mobile resources mean the websites and   other internet features we own that allow you to interact with our   websites, as well apps we\u2019ve created and distributed to let our   customers and followers view our online and mobile resources or   otherwise interact with the content we provide.\nWHO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM\n  We may   collect personal information from the following groups of data subjects:   visitors to, and users of, our online and mobile resources; our   customers; current members of our workforce and those who apply for   posted jobs; and third-party vendors and business partners.\nPersonal information generally means information   that can be used to identify you or that can be easily linked to you   (for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address,   social security number and date of birth). The privacy laws in some   jurisdictions include unique elements in what they consider to be the   personal information of the consumers or data subjects they protect. If   those laws apply to us, as in the case of the California Consumer   Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) or European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), our use of the phrase \u201cpersonal information\u201d includes the unique elements required by such laws.\n  The   categories of information we collect from each of these groups, and the   ways in which we use it, differs. As you may have noticed, it\u2019s   possible that the same person could fall into more than one group. Most   of this statement addresses our processing and sharing of personal   information collected from visitors to and users of our online and   mobile resources and our customers.\n  Nonetheless, we collect and retain the types of professional or employment related personal information you   would expect an employer to have about its existing and former   workforce and new job applicants. We provide legally required notices of   collection and describe our use and sharing of the personal information   of our workforce and applicants in greater detail in confidential   internal human resource manuals and documents accessible to members of   our workforce, or by publication on the proprietary workforce/applicant   portals and apps we operate. In some cases, such portals and apps may be   operated by third parties who transfer the personal information to us.   In those situations, the legal responsibility to provide notice usually   rests with the third party, not us.\nIn addition, like all corporate enterprises, we buy goods and   services, lease equipment and office space and attend industry events.   In doing so, we interact with many existing and potential vendors and business partners from   whom we necessarily collect certain personal information in connection   with our contractual and business relationships. As with our customers,   this information is typically limited to minimum business contact   information. We use and share personal information collected from our   vendors and business partners to manage, administer and perform under   our contracts with them, or share information about our products. We   describe our use of vendor and business partner personal information in   greater detail in our confidential contracts with those parties or on   the internal vendor management portals we operate.\nWHAT WE COLLECT\n  There are two types of   information that we obtain from you online and then store and use: (i)   non-personal information that\u2019s collected automatically from each   visitor, such as your device operating system; and (ii) personal   information that you voluntarily provide to us or that is collected   automatically.\nBy using our online and mobile resources or purchasing   our products or services, you are signifying to us that you agree with   this section of our privacy statement and that we may use and disclose   your information as described.\n  Voluntarily Submitted Information.\nIf you participate in certain activities via our online and mobile   resources, you may be asked to provide us with information about   yourself. The types of personal information we collect in those   situations includes identifiers (such as your name, email address, physical address, and phone number), professional information (such as the business you are in), and financial account information (such   as your credit card information). We do not sell, rent, or trade   voluntarily submitted personal information with third parties.\nIf you don\u2019t want us to collect this type of personal information,   please don\u2019t provide it. This means you shouldn\u2019t participate in the   activities on our online and mobile resources that request or require it   and you may want to communicate with us by phone or regular mail   instead. Participation is strictly your choice. Not participating may   limit your ability to take full advantage of the online and mobile   resources, but it will not affect your ability to access certain   information available to the general public on the online and mobile   resources.\nSome of the ways you voluntarily give us your personal information and how we use it:\nEmails and Online Forms \u2013 When you send us an email   or fill out an online form, such as to contact us, your email address   and any other personal information (e.g., home address or phone number)   that may be in the content of your message or attached to it, are   retained by us and used to respond back directly to you and to process   your request. Depending on the personal information provided,   communications from us may be in the form of emails, telephone calls,   and/or text messages. We may also send you information about any of our   products or services we think may be of interest to you.\nRegistering for an Account \u2013 When you register for   an account or you register your child for a sub-account, you submit   personal information to us such as your name and email address (or your   child\u2019s name and email address) which we then retain. We use that   information to create and manage your account and, in some cases,   establish a password and profile to communicate with you and any   sub-accounts you created via email.\nRegistering for Events \u2013 When you register for   services, webinars, events, conferences, or programs we ourselves may   host (rather than outsource to a third-party event manager with its own   privacy policies), you will be submitting the types of identifiers   described above. If the event requires a fee, we may also ask you to   submit credit card or other financial information. We use this information to register you for the event and send you communications regarding the event.\nBecoming a Subscriber to Our Service \u2013 We use any   information provided from our customers to perform our contractual   obligations and provide the products and services purchased to them, to   manage their accounts and communicate with them.\n  Social Media and Community Features \u2013 Some   of our online and mobile resources may offer social media-like   community features letting users post messages and comments, and/or   upload an image or other files and materials. If you choose to make use   of these features, the information you post, including your screen name   and any other personal information, will be in the public domain and not covered/protected by this statement.\nAutomatically Collected Information.\nWhen you visit our online and mobile resources, basic information is   passively collected through your web browser via use of tracking   technologies, such as a \u201ccookie\u201d which is a small text file that is   downloaded onto your computer or mobile device when you access the   online and mobile resources. It allows us to recognize your computer or   mobile device and store some information about your preferences or past   actions.\nWe allow third party vendors to use cookies or similar technologies   to collect information about your browsing activities over time   following your use of the site. For example, we use Google Analytics, a   web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (\u201cGoogle\u201c).   Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how you use the online   and mobile resources and enhance your experience when you visit the   online and mobile resources. For more information on how Google uses   this data, go to https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites. You can learn more about how to opt out of Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\nThe internet activity information collected through cookies and other   similar means includes such things as: the domain name and IP address   from which you accessed our online and mobile resources; the type of   browser and operating system you use; the date and time and length of   your visit; the specific page visited, graphics viewed and any documents   downloaded; the specific links to other sites you accessed from our   online and mobile resources; and the specific links from other sites you   used to access our online and mobile resources.\nAdditionally, if you access our online and mobile resources from a   phone or other mobile device, the mobile services provider may transmit   to us uniquely identifiable mobile device information which allows us to   then collect mobile phone numbers and associate them with the mobile   device identification information. Some mobile phone vendors also   operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices and we   may receive this information as well if location services are enabled on   your device. If you do not want us to collect and use geolocation data, disable location services through your device settings.\nRegardless, we use both automatically collected information and   mobile device information to compile generic reports about popular pages   on our online and mobile resources, and to see how our customers and   followers are accessing our online and mobile resources. We then use   that data to administer the online and mobile resources and make them   better, make your activities more convenient and efficient and to   enhance the functionality of our online and mobile resources, such as by   remembering certain of your information in order to save you time.\nWe use and retain your personal information in accordance with   applicable law and as long as necessary to carry out the purposes   described above in accordance with our internal data retention   procedures.\nUser Beware: External Sites, Apps, Links and Social Media.\nWe maintain a presence on one or more external social media platforms   such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn. We may further allow   features of our online and mobile resources to connect with, or be   viewable from, that external social media presence. Similarly, our   online and mobile resources may contain links to other websites or apps   controlled by third parties.\nWe are not responsible for either the content on, or the privacy   practices of, social media platforms, or any third-party sites or apps   to which we link. Those apps, sites and platforms are not controlled by   us and therefore have their own privacy policies and terms of use. If   you have questions about how those apps, sites and platforms collect and   use personal information, you should carefully read their privacy   policies and contact them using the information they provide.\nWHEN/WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION\nWe use non-personal information to administer our online and mobile   resources, make them better, and to make business decisions about what   programs our customers might like.\nWe use voluntarily provided personal information to respond to your   inquiries and provide you with the services you have requested, amongst   other uses as further described below. We do not sell or rent your   personal information to third party data vendors or marketing companies.   As you might expect, we disclose your information when required by law.\nAffiliates.\n  In addition to those third   parties set forth above, we may share your information, including   personal information, within our family of companies including but not   limited to  Complily. Those companies will use such information in generally   the same manner as we do under this privacy statement which includes   sending you information about their products, services, or initiatives   that may be of interest to you.\nLegally Compelled Disclosures.\n  We may disclose   your information, including personal information, to government   authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by such   government authorities, or at our discretion or otherwise as required or   permitted by law, including but not limited to responding to court   orders and subpoenas.\nTo Prevent Harm.\n  We may disclose your   information, including personal information, when we have reason to   believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our   rights or property, other users of the online and mobile resources, or   anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.\nBusiness Transfer.\n  If we or any of our   affiliates, or substantially all of its or their assets, are acquired by   one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale,   reorganization, consolidation, or liquidation, personal information may   be one of the transferred assets.\nVendors and Business Partners.\n  We may   share your information, including personal information, with our vendors   and other third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship.   We may also share your information, including personal information, with   vendors who provide third party software services that you have chosen   to assist you with your sales funnels. We do our best to disclose only   the information each of those parties need.\nWe have adopted standards for those vendors and business partners who   receive personal information from us. We attempt to bind such vendors   and business partners to those standards via written contracts. We   further attempt to contractually restrict what our vendors and business   partners can do with the personal information we provide to them such   that it is used only to the extent necessary to carry out the business   purpose for which it was provided; is not disclosed to anyone else   without our consent or under our instruction; remains, as between us and   the applicable vendor or business partner, our property; and is not   transferred out of the United States without our consent.\nPlease note, however, that we cannot guarantee that all   of our vendors and business partners will agree to these contractual   requirements; nor can we ensure that, even when they do agree, they will   always fully comply.\nYOUR RIGHTS AND OPTIONS\n  You do not have to   provide personal information to enjoy most of the features of our online   and mobile resources. Moreover, you can opt out of certain activities   like newsletters and announcements. Residents of California and data   subjects whose personal information was obtained while they were in the   GDPR Jurisdictions have certain additional rights.\nGDPR Jurisdictions means the countries composed of   the European Economic Area (including Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Norway)   and the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,   Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,   Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,   the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain,   and Sweden.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFurthermore, Andorra, Argentina, Canada (only commercial   organizations), Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey,   New Zealand, Switzerland, Uruguay and Japan have received an \u201cadequacy   decision\u201d from the European Commission, adheres to the material terms of   the GDPR.

Since the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) has now formally left the European   Union, it is no longer regulated domestically by the material terms of   the GDPR.\u00a0 The United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation   (\u201cUK-GDPR\u201d) is the UK\u2019s data privacy law that governs the processing of   personal data domestically.\n  If we are using personal information you   provided to us in order to enable us to send you materials, such as   newsletters or product alerts via text or email, and you decide you   don\u2019t want to receive such materials, you may opt out by following the   opt-out instructions in the email or other communication (e.g., by   responding to the text with \u201cSTOP\u201d), or by contacting us using the   contact information below.

You   need to understand it may take a period to remove your name from our   lists after your request and due to such latency, you may still receive   materials for a period of time after you opt out. In addition to opting   out, you have the ability to access, amend, and delete your personal   information by contacting us using the contact information below.\nSome browsers have a \u201cdo not track\u201d feature that lets you tell   websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At   this time, we do not specifically respond to browser \u201cdo not track\u201d   signals.\nCHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY\n  Federal law imposes special   restrictions and obligations on commercial website operators who direct   their operations toward, and collect and use information from, children   under the age of 13. We take those age-related requirements very   seriously, and consistent with it do not intend for our online and   mobile resources to be used by children under the age of 13 without   first obtaining the verifiable consent of such child\u2019s parent or legal   guardian. Moreover, we do not knowingly collect personal information   from minors under the age of 13, only a parent or legal guardian may   provide such information after adhering to our verification process for   submitting such information via the online and mobile resources. If we   become aware that anyone under the age of 18 has submitted personal   information to our online and mobile resources, we will delete that   information and will not use it for any purpose whatsoever. If you   believe that someone under the age of 18 has submitted personal   information to our online and mobile resources, please contact us at support@complily.com.\u00a0   We encourage parents and legal guardians to talk with their children   about the potential risks of providing personal information over the   Internet.\nHOW WE PROTECT COLLECTED PERSONAL INFORMATION\n  We   will take all reasonable security precautions to protect your personal   information provided to our online and mobile resources. We have adopted   a security program that includes technical, organizational,   administrative, and other security measures designed to protect, in a   manner consistent with accepted industry standards and applicable law,   against anticipated or actual threats to the security of personal   information (the \u201cSecurity Program\u201d). We cannot,   however, guarantee that your information, whether during transmission or   while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be free from   unauthorized access or that loss, misuse, destruction, or alteration   will not occur. Except for our duty to maintain the Security Program   under applicable law, we disclaim any other liability for any such theft   or loss of, unauthorized access or damage to, or interception of any   data or communications including personal information. We have every   reason to believe our Security Program is reasonable and appropriate for   our business and the nature of foreseeable risks to the personal   information we collect. We further periodically review and update our   Security Program, including as required by applicable law.\nNonetheless, as part of our Security Program, we have specific   incident response and management procedures that are activated whenever   we become aware that your personal information was likely to have been   compromised. We further require, as part of our vendor and business   partner oversight procedures, that such parties notify us immediately if   they have any reason to believe that an incident adversely affecting   personal information, we provided to them has occurred.\nTHE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT\n  When we   collect personal information from California residents, we become   subject to, and those residents have rights under, the California   Consumer Privacy Act or \u201cCCPA\u201d. This section of our   statement is used to allow us to fulfill our CCPA obligations and   explain your CCPA rights. For purposes of this section, the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d mean only such California residents.\nWhat did we collect from California Residents?\n  We collect the following categories of personal information: identifiers such as name, address, IP address, and other similar identifiers; personal information described in subdivision (e) of Section 1798.80 (California customer records statute) such as a name, address, telephone number, credit card number; commercial information such as products or services purchased; internet/electronic activity such as browsing history and search history; geolocation data including geographic coordinates/physical location; and audio, video, electronic or   other similar information.

To do so, just contact us support@complily.com \u00a0or 888-477-9719.\u00a0 We may ask you to fill out a request form. The CCPA   only allows us to act on your request if we can verify your identity or   your authority to make the request so you will also need to follow our   instructions for identity verification.\n  If you make a verifiable   request per the above, we will confirm our receipt and respond in the   time frames prescribed by the CCPA.\nTHE EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION\n  We do   collect or otherwise obtain personal information from data subjects   located in the GDPR Jurisdictions. We fulfill our GDPR obligations with   respect to our workforce/job applicants, our customers (and their own   end-clients), and our vendors and business partners through a series of   separate notices, contracts or other terms provided to them at the time,   and in the manner and form, GDPR and local law within each GDPR   Jurisdiction requires.\nWe describe, in the immediately following section of this statement,   how we comply with the GDPR for personal information collected from   visitors to and users of our online and mobile resources while they were   in a GDPR Jurisdiction. Thus, for purposes of that section, the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d mean only such GDPR Jurisdiction-based visitors and users.\nWhat do we collect from you in the GDPR Jurisdictions and how do we use it?\n  We   collect from you the categories of personal information already   described. The lawful basis on which we rely for such collection, later   use and disclosure, is what the GDPR refers to as legitimate interest.

More specifically, with respect to personal information collected from   you while you were in a GDPR Jurisdiction, you have these rights:   transparency, access, correction and deletion, portability, who, what,   why and where, and restriction/objection (for more information click here).\nIf you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact support@complily.com.

Among those conditions is our right to decline part or all of a   request if we cannot satisfy our reasonable doubts and concerns about   your identity in a manner that helps us minimize the risk that   unauthorized persons might use a GDPR right to access your personal   information. We will respond to all requests without undue delay, and in   accordance with the time frames, if any, prescribed by the GDPR. If you   are not satisfied with how we use your personal information or respond   to your requests, you have the right to complain to your data protection   regulator.
