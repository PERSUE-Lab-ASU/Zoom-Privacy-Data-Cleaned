<p><strong>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</strong><br>This Privacy Policy covers treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website or the Intelligage Services, but not the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather Personal Information, outlined below, from our users and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Website and the Intelligage Services, including to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to provide and improve the Intelligage Services, and to analyze how you use the Website. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at&nbsp;notices@Intelligage.ai.</p>
<p><strong>Will Intelligage ever change this Privacy Policy?</strong><br>We’re constantly trying to improve our Website and the Intelligage Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide notice of any changes on the Website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that any legal notices will still govern your use of the Website, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them even if you haven’t provided us with your email, or if you have told us you do not want to receive emails from us. If you use the Website or the Intelligage Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong><br>We may receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we may collect Personal Information such as your name and email address. Certain information may be required to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong><br>Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Website, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Intelligage may use the information collected automatically to gauge the interest in Intelligage’s products and services. If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. In addition, if you use any Intelligage Services, we may collect information regarding your login, your account and data you may process using the Intelligage Services.</p>
<p>When we collect the usage information described above, other than to provide support related to Your use of the Intelligage Services, we only use this data in anonymized, aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Website, and we can use that knowledge to make the Website interesting to as many users as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Will Intelligage Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</strong><br>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Anonymized Personal Information:</strong>&nbsp;We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners to understand how often and in what ways people use our Website and the Intelligage Services. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you individually.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties, Vendors and Agents</strong>: We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or the Website to you; for example, we may use Google Analytics to track usage of our Website. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, unless otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Take a look at our <a href="https://intelligage.io/data-processing-addendum/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://intelligage.io/data-processing-addendum/">Data Processing Addendum</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers: </strong>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>
<p>Protection of Intelligage and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Intelligage, our employees, our users, or others.</p>
<p><strong>Is Personal Information about me secure?</strong><br>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
<p>Intelligage retains Personal Information during the term of your use of the Intelligage Services and/or the Intelligage Website, and for one year thereafter, provided that Intelligage may retain your Personal Information for a longer period to the extent required by law, or as reasonably necessary to protect Intelligage’s interests.</p>
<p>In the event of any actual or suspected unauthorized access to your Personal Information, Intelligage will notify you as soon as it is reasonably practicable, and we will provide you with any information and cooperation as may be reasonably required to enable you to mitigate the consequences of the unauthorized access. &nbsp;If there is an actual security breach of Intelligage’s systems, we will, upon the advice of our legal counsel, issue a report that describes the nature of the breach, the steps we have taken to investigate and mitigate the breach and any information we may have regarding the actual disclosures resulting from the breach. If your Personal Information has been provided to Intelligage through the Intelligage Services being provided to a Intelligage customer, you agree that, except as required by law, you will look solely to that customer for any liability with regard to your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>What Personal Information can I access?</strong><br>You have the right to access, correct or request the removal of any Personal Information which Intelligage may have, although if your Personal Information has been provided to Intelligage through the Intelligage &nbsp;Services being provided to a Intelligage customer, you should first contact that customer regarding your Personal Information.</p>

When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.
