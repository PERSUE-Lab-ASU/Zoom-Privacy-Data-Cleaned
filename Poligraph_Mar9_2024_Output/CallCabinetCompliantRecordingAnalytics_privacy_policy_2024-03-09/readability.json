If that should happen, CallCabinet expressly reserves the right to refuse your personal data request. Before CallCabinet is able to accommodate any request, provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies we will verify your identity by requesting certain information or identification. In the instance of CallCabinet acting as a \u201cdata processor\u201d or \u201cservice provider\u201d, you will need to exercise your rights directly with the \u201cdata controller\u201d. GDPR Provides Individuals with Eight Rights: (a) The right to be informed Organizations need to tell individuals what data is being collected, how it\u2019s being used, how long it will be kept and whether it will be shared with any third parties.\u00a0 This information must be communicated concisely and in plain language. (b) The right to access Individuals can submit data access requests, via email which obliges CallCabinet to provide a copy of any personal data concerning the individual.
