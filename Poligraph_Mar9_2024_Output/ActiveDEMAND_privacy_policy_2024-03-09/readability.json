The Site can only access the information from a cookie sent by the Site. We cannot access cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein. Additionally, we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information about you through the use of a cookie. The only way we would learn such information is if you specifically and voluntarily submit that information to us, for example, by entering data on one of the forms on our website.</p>\n<p>We could use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are sent by third parties (e.g. advertising agencies or advertising clients). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. We encourage you to contact the advertiser or its privacy policy for more information on these cookies.

By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the Site best serve the users.</p>\n<p>Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Site, and we refer to these as \u201cperformance\u201d or \u201cfunctionality\u201d cookies. For example, the use of cookies helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Site. The information is used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies also identify you to our server, allowing you to avoid retyping your e-mail address and password each time you access the Site. You may decline to accept cookies sent by the Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, portions of the Site which require registration will not be accessible to you. In such cases, we ask that you register and provide us with basic information on our registration page, or sign in if previously registered. Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you access our Site. We also enable our users to employ cookies and similar tracking technologies in connection with their use of our Services in order to allow us and our users to track their subscribers. Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>\n<h2>Essential Website Cookies</h2>\n<p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
