The nature of collaborative work is causing interruptions which can reduce focus and productivity, especially when these happen at in-opportune moments. The challenge, however is, that in today's hybrid work, it's difficult for teams to know who is currently focused on their work (where an interruption is expensive) and who is open/available for an interaction. The aim of this project is to develop a team awareness tool that improves teamwork, focus and productivity by increasing teams' awareness about co-workers' current and upcoming focus/interruptibility to help balancing focused personal work and interactions with co-workers."}]}, {"role": "heading", "name": "Software Overview", "level": 2, "children": [{"role": "text leaf", "name": "Software Overview"}]}, {"role": "paragraph", "name": "", "children": [{"role": "text leaf", "name": "FlowTeams is a desktop application that reduces interruptions at times of focus, by visualizing your current and upcoming focus to your team members.
