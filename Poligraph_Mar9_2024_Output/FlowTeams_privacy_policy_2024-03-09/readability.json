The nature of collaborative work is causing interruptions which can reduce focus and productivity, especially when these happen at in-opportune moments. The challenge, however is, that in today's hybrid work, it's difficult for teams to know who is currently focused on their work (where an interruption is expensive) and who is open/available for an interaction. The aim of this project is to develop a team awareness tool that improves teamwork, focus and productivity by increasing teams' awareness about co-workers' current and upcoming focus/interruptibility to help balancing focused personal work and interactions with co-workers.</p>\n\n    <h2>Software Overview</h2>\n    <p>FlowTeams is a desktop application that reduces interruptions at times of focus, by visualizing your current and upcoming focus to your team members. That way, whenever they need to ask you a question, they will know if now is a good moment to interrupt, and if not, when later will be a more opportune moment. Thus, you can ideally focus for longer durations with less interruptions, while at the same time, effectively interact with your team.</p>\n\n    <p>To determine your <i>current</i> flow state, which is either 'available for interruptions', 'busy (e.g. in a meeting)', 'focused (i.e. do not disturb)' or 'away', an automated algorithm that was developed in <a href=\"https://hasel.dev/publication/flowlight-reducing-interruptions/\" target=\"_blank\">our previous work</a> will sense your current flow based on your computer interactions. Of course, you can always manually override the flow status or pause the automated measure. In addition, you can also sync the presence state of your Microsoft Teams, Slack and/or Zoom account, to make the automated flow state more accurate, such as when you are in a video call.</p>\n\n    <p>To determine your <i>upcoming</i> flow state, you can plan sessions you want to focus on your work (i.e. personal focus sessions) and sessions that you reserve for interactions with your team (i.e. interaction sessions). Think of the latter ones as times when you plan for work that requires less intensive focus, i.e. when an interruption is not as intrusive. These might be times you answer emails or organize your documents. Your team members will see the times you plan to focus (i.e. bad moment to interrupt) and times you plan to be available for interactions (i.e. good moment to interrupt) in FlowTeams. Finally, you can connect your Microsoft or Google Account, to sync these sessions as well as meetings between the calendar and FlowTeams. That way, if you already have something planned (in the calendar), FlowTeams will display it too. </p>\n\n    <h2>Collected Data</h2>\n    <strong>Computer Interaction and Usage Data collected by FlowTeams:</strong>\n    <p>The following data is collected by FlowTeams.
