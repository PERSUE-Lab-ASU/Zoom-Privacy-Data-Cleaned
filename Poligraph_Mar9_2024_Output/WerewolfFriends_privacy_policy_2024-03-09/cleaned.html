We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors. 
                
                Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading “Cookies and similar tracking technology” below. </li>

                From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources (including Facebook Messenger), but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.

                The types of information we collect from third parties include your nick name and picture and we use the information we receive from these third parties to improve your gaming experience for example in high score listings.</li>
        </ul>

            </p><ul><li>to our group companies, <b>third party services providers and partners</b> who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information.

                <li> to any <b>other person with your consent</b> to the disclosure.</li></ul>
            <p>            <b>Legal basis for processing personal information</b>

            Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

            However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.

            If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

            We will process your information for the purposes of operating our Website, Games and other Services and communicating with you as necessary for those purposes and in our legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, undertaking marketing activities, improving our Games, Website and other Services or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.

            If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below. </p>


        <p>
            <b>Cookies and similar tracking technology</b>
            
            We don’t use cookies on our website. </p>
        <p><b>How does Quicksave Interactive Oy keep my personal information secure?</b> 
        
        We use appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Specific measures we use include anonymizing your data – e.g. our analytics data is fully anonymous.</p>
    <p><b>International data transfers</b> 
        
        Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

        Specifically, our servers are located in Amazon Web Services in Ireland, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.  This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.

        However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing the Binding Corporate Rules for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.

        Our Binding Corporate Rules can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request
    </p>


    <p><b>Data retention</b> 
        
        We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. </p>

    <p><b>Your data protection rights</b>
        
        You have the following data protection rights:
        </p><ul>
            <li>If you wish to <b>access, correct, update or request deletion</b> of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below. </li>
            <li> In addition, you can <b>object to processing</b> of your personal information, ask us to <b>restrict processing</b> of your personal information or <b>request portability</b> of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.</li>
            <li> You have the right to <b>opt-out of marketing communications</b> we send you at any time.  You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.  To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below. </li>
            <li> Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can <b>withdraw your consent</b> at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. </li>
            <li> You have the <b>right to complain to a data protection authority</b> about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. </li></ul>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with
        applicable data protection laws.<p><b>Updates to this Privacy Notice</b>
        
            We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When we update our Privacy Notice, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make.  We will obtain your consent to any material Privacy Notice changes if and where this is required by applicable data protection laws</p>
