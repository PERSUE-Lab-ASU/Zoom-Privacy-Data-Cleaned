If there are any terms in this Privacy Policy you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our Service immediately.</p>



<p>This Privacy Policy pertains to Welo’s practices as a “Data Controller,” where we determine the means and purposes for processing personal data. Where we process data on behalf of our business customers (“Customers”), we act as their “Data Processor,” pursuant to our agreements with them.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What data do we collect?</h3>



<p class="body-note-box"><strong>In short:</strong> We collect technical data, profile data, content, and other data received from you, your organization and other third-party sources.</p>



<p>We collect and control various types of personal data regarding our Users of our Sites and Apps. Such data is collected and generated through your interaction with us or with our Service, through automatic means, or directly from you, from other Users, from our Customers, or from other third parties (including our Service Providers, as defined below). Specifically, we collect the following categories of data (which, to the extent it relates to an identified or identifiable individual, is deemed as “personal data”):</p>



<ul>
<li>Data automatically collected or generated: When you visit, interact with, or use our Service, we collect, record or generate certain technical data about you and your device(s). We do so either independently or with the help of third-party Service Providers, including through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies. Information on cookies and tracking technology is provided in this Cookie Notice. Automatically collected or generated data consists of connectivity, technical and aggregated usage data, such as IP addresses and general locations, device and application data (like type, operating system, mobile device or app id, browser version, locale and language settings used), date and time stamps of usage, the relevant cookies and pixels installed on or interacted with via such device, geolocation information, and the recorded activity (sessions, clicks, use of features, logged activities and other interactions) of visitors and Users in connection with our Service.</li>



<li>User Data received from you: When you contact us, sign up to the Service and create your individual profile, or sign up to an event that we host, organize or sponsor, you provide us with personal data. This would typically include your name, workplace and position, contact details (such as e-mail, phone and address), account login details (e-mail address and other authenticators are automatically hashed), as well as any other data you choose to provide when you use our Service, contact us, or interact with others via our Service. You may also provide us with your profile photo, calendar integration, time-zone, skills, device, general location, and activity logs and data, as well as your preferences, characteristics and objectives for using the Service. You may also send us a “Contact Us” or support requests, initiate a support chat, or provide us with feedback, reviews, or responses to our surveys or promotions, including by submitting an online form on our Service or social media channels, by posting on any of our online public forums or communities, by sending an e-mail to any of our designated addresses, or any other form of communication. Such data may include details on an issue you are experiencing, contact information and any other documentation, screen recording, screenshots or other information.</li>



<li>Customer Data: Welo’s Customers may provide us with additional data such as their billing details, business needs and preferences. To the extent that such data concerns a non-human entity (e.g., the bank account of a company or business), it will not be regarded as “personal data.”</li>



<li>User Data received from our Customers and Users: Customers and Users may provide us with the contact details of Users and potential Users, such as their employees, team members and colleagues, in order for us to contact, invite or subscribe them as Users to our Service (including by using single sign-on tools). Such data typically includes these individuals’ names, phone numbers and work e-mails; however additional data may be provided at the discretion of those providing it. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, this data is also regarded as personal data.</li>



<li>Data received from other third parties: We may receive personal data that relates to you from other sources. For example, if you participate in an event that we sponsor or participate in, we may receive your personal data from its organizers. We may also receive your contact and professional details (e.g., your name, company, position, contact details and professional experience, preferences and interests) from our Partners (defined below), from our service providers, and through the use of tools and channels commonly used for connecting between companies and individual professionals in order to explore potential business and employment opportunities, such as LinkedIn.</li>



<li>Data obtained through analytics tools: We use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to collect data about the use of our Sites and Service. Analytics tools collect data such as how often Users and visitors visit or use the Service, which pages they visit and when, which website, ad or e-mail message brought them there, and how they interact with and use our Service and its various features.

<li>Audio, video, chats and messages: our Service does not store or view user audio or video, which are encrypted in transit. Chats (within the rooms in the space and individual messaging) and messages broadcast to rooms or the Space are transient for the duration of the session and are neither persisted nor stored.

<div id="will-your-data-be-shared-with-anyone" class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Will your data be shared with anyone?</h3>



<p class="body-note-box"><strong>In short:</strong> We share your data with our Service Providers; in accordance with legal compliance requirements; and among other Space Users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p>



<ul>
<li>Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use it for a specific purpose.</li>



<li>Legitimate interest: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</li>



<li>Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal data to fulfill the terms of our contract.</li>



<li>Legal Obligations: Although we anticipate such circumstances to be extremely rare, we may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your personal data when we are legally required in order to do so to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. This could happen in response to a court order or a subpoena in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or such disclosure is required to protect the security or integrity of our products and services.</li>



<li>Service Providers: We engage selected third-party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own. Such service providers include providers of cloud infrastructure, communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), data and cyber security services, fraud detection, investigation and prevention services, web and mobile analytics, e-mail and communication distribution and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, social and advertising networks, content providers, e-mail, voicemails, support and customer relation management systems, and our legal, compliance and financial advisors and auditors (collectively, “Service Providers”). These Service Providers may have access to your personal data, depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Service, and may only use it for such limited purposes as determined in our agreements with them.</li>



<li>Partnerships: We engage selected business and channel partners, resellers, distributors and providers of professional services related to our Service (“Partners”), which allow us to explore and pursue growth opportunities by facilitating a stronger local presence and tailored experiences for our prospective and existing Customers and Users. In such instances, we may share relevant contact, business and usage details with the respective Partner, to allow them to engage with those Customers and Users for such purposes. If you directly engage with any of our Partners, please note that any aspect of that engagement which is not directly related to the Service and directed by Welo is beyond the scope of Welo’s Terms and Privacy Policy, and may therefore be governed by the Partner’s terms and privacy policy.</li>



<li>Application Providers and Event Sponsors: if so instructed or permitted by you or your Account Admin, we may share your personal data (such as your User Profile and contact details, as well as relevant usage data) with the provider(s) of any third party applications or integrations added to your Account. Similarly, if you register for any event that we host, organize or sponsor, then with your permission we may share your registration details with others, including the hosts, organizers, speakers, service providers and sponsors of that event, so that they may contact you with relevant information and offers, or to fulfill any promotions related to the event.</li>



<li>Customers and other Users: Your personal data may be shared with the Customer owning the Account to which you are subscribed as a User (including data and communications concerning your User Profile), as well as other Users of that Account or Space. For instance, you may be able to maintain a user profile with information about yourself that you can make available to other users or the public. Your personal data and activity within the Service may also be monitored, processed and analyzed by the Account Admin. This includes instances where you contact us for help in resolving an issue specific to a team of which you are a member (and which is managed by the same Customer). Please note that Welo is not responsible for and does not control any further disclosure, use or monitoring by or on behalf of the Customer (including sharing of boards or use of broadcast features within the Service), that itself acts as the “Data Controller” of such data.</li>



<li>Service integrations: When you access the Space as a User, you or your Account Admin may choose to integrate your Account on the Service with a third-party service (provided that such integration is supported by our Service). The provider of this integrated third-party service may receive certain relevant data about or from your Account on the Service, or share certain relevant data from that account on the third-party provider’s service with our Service, depending on the nature and purpose of such integration. This could include your User Data. Note that we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third-party services (but do typically require and store your authentication token in order to integrate with them). If you do not wish your data to be shared with such third-party service(s), you may elect not to enable such integrations and/or contact your Account Admin.</li>



<li>Protecting Rights and Safety: We may share your personal data with others if we reasonably believe that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of Welo, any of our Users or Customers, or any members of the general public.</li>



<li>Welo Internal and Affiliated Companies: We share personal data internally for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if Welo were to undergo any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all of its assets, your personal data may be shared with the parties involved in such an event. In the event we believe that such change in control might materially affect your personal data then stored with us, we will notify you of this event and the choices you may have via e-mail or prominent notice on our Service.</li>
</ul>



<p>Additional Purposes: For the avoidance of doubt, your personal data may be shared by Welo in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal and anonymous.</p>

<p>Your data may be stored in multiple locations around the world, for as long as necessary in accordance with our reasonable business needs; as necessary for the performance of our Service; for supporting and exercising our legitimate interests; and in accordance with our legal obligations.</p>



<p>With respect to personal data of individuals from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“UK”) or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We will generally collect personal data from you or a third party only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms).</p>



<p>European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses</p>



<p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal data, including using the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of information between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal data that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Data Processing Agreements that include Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request.
