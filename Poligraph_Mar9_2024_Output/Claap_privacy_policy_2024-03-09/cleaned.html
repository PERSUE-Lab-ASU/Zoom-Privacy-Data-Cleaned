It lets you see how many hours you spend in meetings in a Google Calendar. This web app is a standalone product, separate from our main Claap product and has no technical dependency with it.</p><p>Claap’s Meeting Calculator connects to the Google Calendar API to fetch your calendars and events, crunches the data, and displays some computed insights nicely. This connection happens directly from your browser to the Google API. This app only has read-only access to your calendar data. There are no servers or services involved that might cache the data. By using the Meeting Calculator you consent to allowing this API connection.&nbsp;</p><p>None of the data fetched from the Google Calendar API is saved elsewhere but in your browser. After you close the browser window/tab all data is deleted.&nbsp;</p><p>Claap does not store and has no knowledge of your calendar data.&nbsp;</p><p>Claap’s Meeting Calculator uses the following data processor in addition to Claap’s sub-processors listed above:</p><ul role="list"><li>Mailchimp (<a href="https://mailchimp.com/fr/">https://mailchimp.com</a>)</li></ul><p>‍</p></div><div id="tracking-technologies" style="scroll-margin-top: 100px;"><h2>Tracking Technologies</h2><p>‍</p><div id="cookies"><h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3><p>We use Cookies to enhance the performance and functionality of our website/app but are non-essential to their use.

Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p><p>‍</p></div><div id="what-is-personal-data"><h3>What is personal data?</h3><p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p><p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li></ul><p>‍</p></div><div id="why-is-gdpr-important"><h3>Why is GDPR important?</h3><p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Claap we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p><p>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</p><p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Claap processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p><p>We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data.
