<html><head></head><body><p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At DemoTime, Ltd, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
<h3 id="who-we-are-and-what-this-policy-covers">Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h3>
<p>Howdy! We are the folks behind a set of tools which help our users get the most out of our partners' marketing software such as Oracle Eloqua.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our websites (including demotime.com);</li>
<li>Our applications (including the main DemoTime app, and our browser extension);</li>
<li>Direct integrations with our app(s) - e.g. if you connect your Zoom account, this transfers data about users and meetings;</li>
<li>Any other products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites;</li>
</ul>
<p>This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at DemoTime Ltd. or work with us commercially. Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.” Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
<h3 id="source-template">Source Template</h3>

The document we adapted this from is made freely available for this purpose at <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">GitHub</a>. Beyond giving them credit as the original author of large parts of this document, we have no affiliation or association with Automattic</p>
<h3 id="relationship-with-oracle-eloqua">Relationship with Zoom and other third-parties</h3>
<p>Many of our services are offered to users of Zoom and other third-party tools. We are a technical partner and have built software that integrates with Zoom and others, however we do not speak for any of these parties in any capacity. We make no claim to represent them in any way. Any mention of these third parties (Zoom, MixPanel and other services we integrate with) in this document comes only from our perspective and is for descriptive purposes only.</p>
<h3 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information directly to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>
<h4 id="_information-you-provide-to-us_"><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></h4>
<p>It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic account information:</strong> We may ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, on our order forms we will ask for basic account information, or information may be provided within our applications</li>
<li><strong>Settings and Profile:</strong> There are some opportunities to provide information to us through the settings or operation of our applications. User profiles can be set-up with basic contact information</li>
<li><strong>Your Content:</strong> When using our applications you will likely configure steps with content. We do not access or share this information, except for engineers explicitly providing troubleshooting and support on your behalf</li>
<!-- <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> There are opportunities to link our Services to other third-party services. These vary by product but can include: Oracle Eloqua, Facebook, Google &amp; similar services. These are implemented as an explicit oAuth flow. Use of these connections will cause us to store oAuth credentials to maintain our integration with these services.</li> -->
<li><strong>Communications with us (hi there!):</strong> You may also provide us with information when you communicate with us directly via form, email, phone, Zoom, Teams or otherwise. We routinely store copies of electronic communication (email, chat logs, form submissions) as part of providing services. We may record Zoom or Teams meetings - if we do this will be explicitly indicated by the software and/or host.</li>
<li><strong>Job applicant information:</strong> If you apply for a job with us — awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, and work authorization verification as part of the application process.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="_information-we-collect-automatically_"><em>Information We Collect Automatically</em></h4>
<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services.</li>
<li><strong>Meetings:</strong> DemoTime processes and stores information about meetings &amp; attendance, in order to determine if a meeting was a sales-demo &amp; produce a summary</li>
<li><strong>Usage data of your app by your reps:</strong> People who install the browser-extension OR connect a product-analytics provider do so specifically to provide us with usage data. By seeing exactly what your rep did during the demo, we can accurately summarize the meeting &amp; add relevant content</li>
<li><strong>Usage information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we use Honeycomb.io to collect events for software observability. This helps us identify errors at scale. We reserve the right to collect any similar analytical data for operating, improving and supporting our Services. These can include information on which user or account is performing an action</li>
<li><strong>Location information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>
<li><strong>Push subscriber information:</strong> For our Push messaging services, you may implement an API (App Push) or embed a script (Web Push) which collects a push-sending token and a user-identifier (usually email address). We store this for you to enable you to send messages to that specific user.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information from cookies &amp; other technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. We use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our <a href="http://instant.marketing/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="_information-we-collect-from-other-sources_"><em>Information We Collect from Other Sources</em></h4>
<p>We may also get information about you from other sources. For example: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third Party Login:</strong> If you create or log in to your account through another service (like Google, Facebook or Microsoft) we’ll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your username, your email address)</li>
</ul>
<p>The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available. </p>
<p>Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-why-we-use-information">How and Why We Use Information</h3>
<h4 id="_purposes-for-using-information_"><em>Purposes for Using Information</em></h4>
<p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To provide our Services.</strong> For example, to set up and maintain your account, provide your service, backup and restore your information, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.</li>
<li><strong>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.</strong> For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.</li>
<li><strong>To place and manage ads.</strong> We may process our direct first party information for our own advertising purposes, for example to send hashes of email addresses for advertising targeting. This hashing algorithm is non-recoverable and is therefore privacy sensitive. We will only process data owned by our customers in this way on their direct instruction (e.g. providing the service on their behalf through our ad-targeting products).</li>
<li><strong>To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.</strong> For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.</li>
<li><strong>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</strong> For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of DemoTime, Ltd. and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.</li>
<li><strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong> For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.</li>
<li><strong>To customize the user experience.</strong> For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.</li>
<li><strong>To communicate with you.</strong> For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on DemoTime, Ltd.; texting you to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)</li>
<li><strong>To recruit and hire new employees.</strong> For example, by evaluating job applicants and communicating with them.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="_legal-bases-for-collecting-and-using-information_"><em>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</em></h4>
<p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our <a href="http://instant.marketing/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-information">Sharing Information</h3>
<h4 id="_how-we-share-information_"><em>How We Share Information</em></h4>
<p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below, as well as in the section called Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, which we may use to process payments), technical infrastructure (like Google Cloud, which hosts our application and MongoDB which hosts our database - although in both cases those companies do not access unencrypted data directly), postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, CRM, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that we utilize to directly provide requested services (like Facebook or Google for ad-targeting, Stannp or other providers for Direct Mail, Firebase for push-messaging or URL-shortening, Twilio and other SMS vendors for our SMS service, WhatsApp and Twilio for our WhatsApp service. This is not an exhaustive list and there may be others). Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our <a href="http://instant.marketing/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
<li><strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of DemoTime, Ltd., third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay. In practice this has never occurred. But it was in the source document, so we kept it in ours.</li>
<li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that DemoTime, Ltd. goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Published support requests:</strong> If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users' data. We aren't a data broker, we don't sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don't sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.</p>
<h4 id="_information-shared-publicly_"><em>Information Shared Publicly</em></h4>
<p>Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly. That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your “Likes” and comments on other websites are all available to others. We don't currently have features that operate this way, but we may add such features in the future.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-we-keep-information">How Long We Keep Information</h3>
<p>We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it. For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor, like the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. This may vary based upon defaults set by our technical infrasturcture partners. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to websites/Services and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites/Services.</p>
<p>We store the data we process (eg. data we process for our customers on their contacts) for 7 days, (except for more anonymized analytical data which is retained indefinitely). This direct processing window may be extended in the unlikely event of a backup restore or system failure. Some services, most notably push notifications, require us to store that particular record type indefinitely until the end of your contract.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.</p>
<h3 id="choices">Choices</h3>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit the information that you provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Limit the contact data that we process:</strong> When you use a field-merge, that data is sent to us for all contacts which pass through that step. Email address is also always sent. So you can limit the data we process by limiting the data you use in our applications. Or by limiting the number of contacts which pass through our applications.</li>
<li><strong>Opt out of marketing communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
<li><strong>Set your browser to reject cookies:</strong> At this time, DemoTime, Ltd. does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using DemoTime, Ltd. websites, with the drawback that certain features of websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. Currently it is not possible to directly use applications such as our configuration UIs without cookies.</li>
<li><strong>Close your account:</strong> While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services.Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="your-rights">Your Rights</h3>
<p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>
<h4 id="_european-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-_"><em>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em></h4>
<p>If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>
<h4 id="_california-consumer-privacy-act-ccpa-_"><em>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</em></h4>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li>
<li>Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);</li>
<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services);</li>
<li>Geolocation data (such as your approximate location based on your IP address);</li>
<li>Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information, or information you provide in a job application); and</li>
<li>Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the <em>Information We Collect</em> section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the <em>How and Why We Use Information</em> section. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the <em>Sharing Information</em> section. If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;</li>
<li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>
<li>Opt out of any sale of personal information; and</li>
<li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="_contacting-us-about-these-rights_"><em>Contacting Us About These Rights</em></h4>
<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other rights, <a href="https://instant.marketing">visit our website</a> to, well, find out how to reach us. When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-reach-us">How to Reach Us</h3>
<p>If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, <a href="https://demotime.com">visit our website</a> to contact us through web-form.</p>
<h3 id="other-things-you-should-know-keep-reading-">Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)</h3>
<h4 id="_transferring-information_"><em>Transferring Information</em></h4>
<p>Because DemoTime, Ltd.’s Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third-party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use Information section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with entities based in countries outside the EEA. You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it from the EU.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, DemoTime, Ltd. may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. DemoTime, Ltd. encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a statement to our homepage or blog, or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.</p>
