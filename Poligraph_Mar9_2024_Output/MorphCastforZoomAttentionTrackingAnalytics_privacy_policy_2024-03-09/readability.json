By way of example, you may provide your personal data through sending email in order to voluntarily contact Cynny, and through other interactions with the Services. Cynny processes the Business Users\u2019 Personal Data, according to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as data controller. The specific categories of such Business Users\u2019 Personal Data processed by Cynny consist of the following identifying information:</p>\n<p>\u2013 You may provide personally identifiable information about yourself when using the Service by expressly authorizing Zoom to provide Cynny with the data related to your profile and your video conferences:</p>\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>id</td><td>User\u2019s Zoom ID Zoom</td></tr><tr><td>email</td><td>Email the user used to register for the Zoom service</td></tr><tr><td>first_name</td><td>name</td></tr><tr><td>last_name</td><td>User</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>\u2018s account type (eg. Basic, licensed, ect)</td></tr><tr><td>timezone</td><td>Time zone of the user</td></tr><tr><td>pic_url</td><td>URL of the profile picture of the user</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<p>Zoom, always under your authorization, also makes available data relating to your videoconferences. Of these data, Cynny reads and uses only the following:</p>\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>id</td><td>Id of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>uuid</td><td>Unique id of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>agenda</td><td>Description of the meeting (maximum 2000 characters)</td></tr><tr><td>duration</td><td>Duration of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>Type of meeting (e.g. instantaneous, recurring, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>start_time</td><td>Date and start time of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>start_url</td><td>Url with which the Zoom account owner starts the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>status</td><td>Status of the meeting (e.g. Waiting, Started)</td></tr><tr><td>topic</td><td>Title of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>join_url</td><td>Url that allows Guests to join the meeting</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<p>\u2013 You may provide personally identifiable information about you when using the Service, such as: first and last name and Business User\u2019s or organization\u2019s related administrative contact, email address, physical address and other unique identifier, financial processing and payment information, as well as <strong>statistical data daily on the use of the Service, aggregated by reference pages in which the Service is implemented </strong>such as, by way of example and for this applicable, the license key assigned to each Business User under the Terms of Use of the Service available at the link <a href=\"https://www.morphcast.com/zmtou/\">MorphCast Emotion AI for Zoom \u2013 Terms of Use</a> and the Conditions of Use of other MorphCast services, available in the links contained in the page <a href=\"https://www.morphcast.com/mission/\">mission</a>, number of times the Service has been requested, initialized, authorized and started, number of errors that may have occurred, number of frames analyzed and usage time<strong> </strong>spent using the Service by each user.</p>\n<p>\u2013 Furthermore, if the Business User, Zoom account owner, as organizer of the videoconference/webinar, henceforth also called \u201c<strong>Host</strong>\u201c, has activated the MorphCast Emotion AI analysis available in the Service and the guest of the videoconference/webinar has expressly agreed to be analyzed, Cynny is appointed responsible of the processing by the Business User, as data controller, of additional categories of personal data (<strong>\u201cGuest Personal Data\u201d</strong>) exclusively for the purpose of their conservation and related accessibility by the Business User. The specific categories of Guest Personal Data consist of the following information: name entered by the guest prior to participation in the video conference/webinar; with a certain degree of accuracy, the dominant emotions according to the model of Paul Ekman; mood, level of attention and involvement (Russell\u2019s circumflex model of affects based on arousal and valence).</p>\n<p>\u2013 As regards the Host, Cynny, through the MorphCast For Zoom application, uses <strong>cookie and localstorage</strong> of the browser for its correct functioning. When you connect with your Zoom account, a cookie is provided to your browser containing:</p>\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Mph JWT</td><td>JSON web token used to authenticate all requests that occur between client and server. Without it, no requests from the client will be processed by the server</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom Access Token</td><td>Token provided at login via OAuth 2.0 flow, allows the server to interact with the Zoom APIs. This token has a fixed validity time decided by Zoom.</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom Refresh Token</td><td>Token that allows you to obtain a valid Access Token in case the previous one has expired.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<p>The data indicated above are not accessible from the Host as they are encrypted and decrypted by the server. Encryption takes place using the advanced AES-256 encryption standard with a unique initialization vector (Techtarget: definition of <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/initialization-vector-IV\">initialization vector</a>). This makes it very difficult for a hacker to decrypt the contents of the cookies.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, MorphCast for Zoom saves the timestamp indicating the expiration of the tokens in the Host\u2019s browser local storage, information that is used to decrease Client-Server interactions and therefore speed up the user experience.</p>\n<p>In addition to those used by Cynny in the MorphCast for Zoom application, once you enter a video conference/webinar, Zoom also uses cookies to:</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp; enable basic functionality</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp; analyze trends</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp; understand when and how you visit and interact with Zoom websites</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp; collect information about your device and settings</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp; enable third-party advertising on its websites</p>\n<p>Source: Information <a href=\"https://explore.zoom.us/en/cookie-policy/#:~:text=Zoom%20uses%20Cookies%20to%20enable,other%20websites%20through%20our%20partners.\">Cookie Statement powered by zoom.us</a>.</p>\n<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, Zoom requires your prior consent for different types of cookies or allows you to refuse them. Zoom cookies are also used for Guests, who instead will not have cookies or data in localstorage by MorphCast for Zoom.</p>\n<p>\u2013 Finally, Cynny may also collect personal data when users browse the MorphCast website through their browser\u2019s cookies. In that case, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.morphcast.com/site_privacy_cookie_policy/\">Website Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy</a> available on the website.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2013 Under no circumstances does Cynny collect any special categories of personal data, as defined by Article 9 of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>\u2013 Under no circumstances does Cynny collect any special categories of personal data, as defined by Article 9 of the GDPR.</p>\n<p><strong>Methods of processing Business Users\u2019 Personal Data</strong></p>\n<p>Cynny will process Business Users\u2019 Personal Data using manual, paper, computer and electronic instruments, even to store, manage or process such Business Users\u2019 Personal Data, suitable to ensure their security and confidentiality, according to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable privacy legislation, including GDPR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cynny will not sell, rent, license, or trade the Business Users\u2019 Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing use unless we receive your express consent to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Cynny may share specific Personal Data, such as the name and email address of Business Users, with <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/\">TrustPilot</a> solely for the purpose of allowing Trustpilot to send requests to review Cynny\u2019s services. This sharing of information is done with the understanding that Business Users may receive review requests from TrustPilot as part of our effort to enhance our service quality. In this process, Cynny acts as the data controller for the personal data of the Professional Users. This means that we are responsible for the collection, processing, and management of your personal data in relation to the sending of these invitations. Trustpilot, on the other hand, serves as the data processor, managing the personal data of the Professional Users according to our instructions and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws.</p>\n<p>Except for this specific purpose, and unless you provide us with permission, Cynny will not share Business Users\u2019 Personal Data, as collected through the use of the Service covered by this Privacy Policy, other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Purposes and legal basis of the processing of Business Users\u2019 Personal Data&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>We may use the Business Users\u2019 Personal Data you provide to us, in compliance with the applicable privacy legislation, when you use the Service, in the following ways:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>for the execution of pre-contractual and contractual obligations with the Business Users, including, without limitation, to allow us to provide you with a better service answering your requests and to quickly process your transactions.
