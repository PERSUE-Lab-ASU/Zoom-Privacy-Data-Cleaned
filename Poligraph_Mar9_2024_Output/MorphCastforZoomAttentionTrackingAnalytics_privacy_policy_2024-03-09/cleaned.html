<p>Effective March 3, 2024</p>
<p><em>Summary:</em></p>
<p><em>This Privacy Policy governs the MorphCast Emotion AI for Zoom Plugin, outlining Cynny’s practices for collecting and disclosing Business Users’ Personal Data. It applies exclusively to data collected through the Service, distinct from other Cynny services or the embedded Zoom service. Acceptance of this policy is required for use; changes will be communicated to users.</em></p>
<p><em>Personal data collection methods include direct user input and Zoom’s authorization to share profile and video conference data. This data encompasses user identification, meeting details, and, if consent is given, emotional analysis during video conferences.</em></p>
<p><em>Cynny uses cookies and local storage for functionality, including authentication and interaction with Zoom’s APIs, ensuring data encryption and security. Cynny also collects website navigation data through browser cookies, with specific policies outlined separately.</em></p>
<p><em>Personal data processing aligns with GDPR, aiming to secure and maintain confidentiality. Cynny commits not to sell or trade personal data for marketing without express consent and may share data with TrustPilot for service review purposes, acting as the data controller.</em></p>
<p><em>The policy details the purposes and legal bases for data processing, including contractual obligations, legal compliance, and direct marketing activities, with consent as a basis for newsletter subscriptions and feedback collection.</em></p>
<p><em>Data retention policies adhere to legal and contractual requirements, ensuring data deletion or anonymization after specified periods or upon account deletion. Third-party disclosures are limited to necessary operations and legal obligations.</em></p>
<p><em>Business Users have rights under GDPR to access, rectify, or delete their data, with mechanisms to withdraw consent for newsletters and marketing communications.</em></p>
<p><em>Updates to the policy will be communicated, especially for significant changes affecting personal data use. For inquiries or data management requests, contact details for Cynny and the appointed Data Protection Officer are provided.</em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>MorphCast® Emotion AI for ZOOM – Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy</strong></p>
<p>Cynny S.p.A. (“Cynny”), enrolled at the Business Registry of Florence, VAT number No. IT06340560488, D-U-N-S® number 434193325, is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your personal data under the applicable privacy legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation UE 2016/679 (“GDPR”). The contact details of Cynny are indicated within the “<em>Questions?</em>” section below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the product MorphCast Emotion AI for Zoom Plugin (the “<strong>Service</strong>”). This Privacy Policy explains Cynny’s collection and disclosure practices of the Business Users’ Personal Data (as defined below) of the companies or organizations using the Service (“<strong>Business Users</strong>”) to which the Service is exclusively addressed, as explained by the relevant Terms of Use, and applies solely to the Business Users’ Personal Data that we collect through the Service (and not also through the MorphCast website and/or other tools made available by Cynny not based on MorphCast Emotion AI for Zoom Plugin). For the privacy regulation of other services offered by Cynny, including MorphCast Emotion AI Interactive Media Platform, you may refer to the other policies adopted by Cynny which may apply in this respect, as available in the page at this link: <a href="https://www.morphcast.com/mission/">mission</a>. For the privacy regulation of Zoom service embedded in MorphCast Emotion AI for Zoom Plugin you may refer to the policies adopted by Zoom US which may apply in this respect, as available at this link: <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/privacy/">Zoom Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>– By using the Service, you signify your acceptance of the relevant provisions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.&nbsp; Your continued use of the Service following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you have accepted those changes.</p>
<p><strong>Categories of Business Users’ Personal Data we collect and how we collect it</strong></p>
<p>As for the modalities through which Cynny can collect the Business Users’ personal data (“<strong>Business Users’</strong> <strong>Personal Data</strong>”), please note that such modalities are determined by your use of the Services. By way of example, you may provide your personal data through sending email in order to voluntarily contact Cynny, and through other interactions with the Services. Cynny processes the Business Users’ Personal Data, according to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as data controller. The specific categories of such Business Users’ Personal Data processed by Cynny consist of the following identifying information:</p>
<p>– You may provide personally identifiable information about yourself when using the Service by expressly authorizing Zoom to provide Cynny with the data related to your profile and your video conferences:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>id</td><td>User’s Zoom ID Zoom</td></tr><tr><td>email</td><td>Email the user used to register for the Zoom service</td></tr><tr><td>first_name</td><td>name</td></tr><tr><td>last_name</td><td>User</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>‘s account type (eg. Basic, licensed, ect)</td></tr><tr><td>timezone</td><td>Time zone of the user</td></tr><tr><td>pic_url</td><td>URL of the profile picture of the user</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Zoom, always under your authorization, also makes available data relating to your videoconferences. Of these data, Cynny reads and uses only the following:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>id</td><td>Id of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>uuid</td><td>Unique id of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>agenda</td><td>Description of the meeting (maximum 2000 characters)</td></tr><tr><td>duration</td><td>Duration of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>Type of meeting (e.g. instantaneous, recurring, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>start_time</td><td>Date and start time of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>start_url</td><td>Url with which the Zoom account owner starts the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>status</td><td>Status of the meeting (e.g. Waiting, Started)</td></tr><tr><td>topic</td><td>Title of the meeting</td></tr><tr><td>join_url</td><td>Url that allows Guests to join the meeting</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>– You may provide personally identifiable information about you when using the Service, such as: first and last name and Business User’s or organization’s related administrative contact, email address, physical address and other unique identifier, financial processing and payment information, as well as <strong>statistical data daily on the use of the Service, aggregated by reference pages in which the Service is implemented </strong>such as, by way of example and for this applicable, the license key assigned to each Business User under the Terms of Use of the Service available at the link <a href="https://www.morphcast.com/zmtou/">MorphCast Emotion AI for Zoom – Terms of Use</a> and the Conditions of Use of other MorphCast services, available in the links contained in the page <a href="https://www.morphcast.com/mission/">mission</a>, number of times the Service has been requested, initialized, authorized and started, number of errors that may have occurred, number of frames analyzed and usage time<strong> </strong>spent using the Service by each user.</p>
<p>– Furthermore, if the Business User, Zoom account owner, as organizer of the videoconference/webinar, henceforth also called “<strong>Host</strong>“, has activated the MorphCast Emotion AI analysis available in the Service and the guest of the videoconference/webinar has expressly agreed to be analyzed, Cynny is appointed responsible of the processing by the Business User, as data controller, of additional categories of personal data (<strong>“Guest Personal Data”</strong>) exclusively for the purpose of their conservation and related accessibility by the Business User. The specific categories of Guest Personal Data consist of the following information: name entered by the guest prior to participation in the video conference/webinar; with a certain degree of accuracy, the dominant emotions according to the model of Paul Ekman; mood, level of attention and involvement (Russell’s circumflex model of affects based on arousal and valence).</p>
<p>– As regards the Host, Cynny, through the MorphCast For Zoom application, uses <strong>cookie and localstorage</strong> of the browser for its correct functioning. When you connect with your Zoom account, a cookie is provided to your browser containing:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Mph JWT</td><td>JSON web token used to authenticate all requests that occur between client and server. Without it, no requests from the client will be processed by the server</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom Access Token</td><td>Token provided at login via OAuth 2.0 flow, allows the server to interact with the Zoom APIs. This token has a fixed validity time decided by Zoom.</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom Refresh Token</td><td>Token that allows you to obtain a valid Access Token in case the previous one has expired.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The data indicated above are not accessible from the Host as they are encrypted and decrypted by the server. Encryption takes place using the advanced AES-256 encryption standard with a unique initialization vector (Techtarget: definition of <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/initialization-vector-IV">initialization vector</a>). This makes it very difficult for a hacker to decrypt the contents of the cookies.</p>
<p>In addition to this, MorphCast for Zoom saves the timestamp indicating the expiration of the tokens in the Host’s browser local storage, information that is used to decrease Client-Server interactions and therefore speed up the user experience.</p>
<p>In addition to those used by Cynny in the MorphCast for Zoom application, once you enter a video conference/webinar, Zoom also uses cookies to:</p>
<p>· &nbsp; enable basic functionality</p>
<p>· &nbsp; analyze trends</p>
<p>· &nbsp; understand when and how you visit and interact with Zoom websites</p>
<p>· &nbsp; collect information about your device and settings</p>
<p>· &nbsp; enable third-party advertising on its websites</p>
<p>Source: Information <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/cookie-policy/#:~:text=Zoom%20uses%20Cookies%20to%20enable,other%20websites%20through%20our%20partners.">Cookie Statement powered by zoom.us</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, Zoom requires your prior consent for different types of cookies or allows you to refuse them. Zoom cookies are also used for Guests, who instead will not have cookies or data in localstorage by MorphCast for Zoom.</p>
<p>– Finally, Cynny may also collect personal data when users browse the MorphCast website through their browser’s cookies. In that case, please refer to the <a href="https://www.morphcast.com/site_privacy_cookie_policy/">Website Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy</a> available on the website.&nbsp;</p>

This sharing of information is done with the understanding that Business Users may receive review requests from TrustPilot as part of our effort to enhance our service quality. In this process, Cynny acts as the data controller for the personal data of the Professional Users. This means that we are responsible for the collection, processing, and management of your personal data in relation to the sending of these invitations. Trustpilot, on the other hand, serves as the data processor, managing the personal data of the Professional Users according to our instructions and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws.</p>

<li>for the execution of pre-contractual and contractual obligations with the Business Users, including, without limitation, to allow us to provide you with a better service answering your requests and to quickly process your transactions.

<li>to send communications of promotional nature via email concerning the Service already purchased by the Business User and/or services similar to the same offered by Cynny (“Soft Spam Communications“); also in this case, the legal basis for the processing of the Business Users’ Personal Data is the data controller’s legitimate interest;</li>
<li>to carry out direct marketing activities by sending newsletters. In this case the legal basis for the processing of the Business Users’ Personal Data is the consent that will be provided by the Business Users once they subscribe to the newsletter through the relevant consent form.</li>

</ol>
<p>The provision and processing of the Business Users’ Personal Data for the purposes under points a), b), and c) above is necessary for the provision of the Service and does not require your consent. Any refusal to provide the requested Business Users’ Personal Data or their inaccuracy could make it impossible for you to use the Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the Business User may revoke his/her consent to receive the newsletter and/or communicate its intention to interrupt the delivery of Soft Spam Communications by sending an email to Cynny or by using the link found in each newsletter email or Soft Spam Communication, as indicated in the following section “<em>Rights of the Business Users</em>”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data retention. The Business Users’ Personal Data that are collected for the purposes identified under the above-mentioned section “<em>Purposes and legal basis of the processing of Business Users’ Personal Data</em>” may be stored, in accordance with the proportionality principle, for the fulfillment of contractual and legal obligations, including those of a social security and/or tax nature, for a period not exceeding (i) the data retention period provided for by the regulations in force for each category of data, and (ii) the limitation period provided for by law in order to enforce or defend a legal claim against you or against third parties, provided that the Business Users’ Personal Data collected for the sending of newsletter for the purposes identified under letter e) above will be stored for a maximum period of 24 months unless Business Users withdraw their consent previously.</p>
