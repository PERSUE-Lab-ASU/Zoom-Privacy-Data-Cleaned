This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect through our App, how we use and protect that information, and the choices you can make about how we use this information.</p><h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2><p>Our App collects information in a few different ways:</p><h3>1.1 Google OAuth Access Data</h3><p>Suggestly connects to your Google Account via OAuth and requests access to certain scopes for enhanced functionality. The scopes we request access to include:</p><div><ul><li><span><strong>Primary Email Address:</strong></span> Your primary Google Account email address is used for identification and direct communication purposes.</li><li><span><strong>Personal Info:</strong></span> This includes any personal info you've made publicly available on your Google profile. We use this information to customize user experience.</li><li><span><strong>Google Drive Files:</strong></span> With your permission, our App can see, edit, create, and delete specific Google Drive files that you use with the App. This includes company FAQ documents or other relevant information that you choose to upload to the App. The content of these documents is used to generate relevant responses during Zoom calls, enhancing the functionality of the App by making it more knowledgeable about your company's specifics. This also allows for a seamless integration where necessary documents can be managed directly through the App.</li><li><span><strong>Google Calendar (Read-only):</strong></span> The App has read-only access to any of your calendars accessible via Google Calendar. This is used for scheduling features within the App, such as scheduling bots for upcoming calls.</li></ul></div><h3>1.2 Zoom OAuth Access Data</h3><p>Suggestly connects to your Zoom account via OAuth and requires certain permissions to provide its services effectively.
