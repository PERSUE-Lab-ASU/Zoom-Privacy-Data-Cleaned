This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect through our App, how we use and protect that information, and the choices you can make about how we use this information.</div><h2 class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">1. Data Collection and Usage</h2><div class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">Our App collects information in a few different ways:</div><h3 class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">1.1 Google OAuth Access Data</h3><div class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">Suggestly connects to your Google Account via OAuth and requests access to certain scopes for enhanced functionality. The scopes we request access to include:</div><div class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><ul><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>Primary Email Address:</strong></span> Your primary Google Account email address is used for identification and direct communication purposes.</li><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>Personal Info:</strong></span> This includes any personal info you've made publicly available on your Google profile. We use this information to customize user experience.</li><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>Google Drive Files:</strong></span> With your permission, our App can see, edit, create, and delete specific Google Drive files that you use with the App. This includes company FAQ documents or other relevant information that you choose to upload to the App. The content of these documents is used to generate relevant responses during Zoom calls, enhancing the functionality of the App by making it more knowledgeable about your company's specifics. This also allows for a seamless integration where necessary documents can be managed directly through the App.</li><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>Google Calendar (Read-only):</strong></span> The App has read-only access to any of your calendars accessible via Google Calendar. This is used for scheduling features within the App, such as scheduling bots for upcoming calls.</li></ul></div><h3 class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">1.2 Zoom OAuth Access Data</h3><div class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">Suggestly connects to your Zoom account via OAuth and requires certain permissions to provide its services effectively. Below are the Zoom scopes we request access to and why we need them:</div><div class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><ul><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>zoomapp:inmeeting:</strong></span> This scope is essential for Suggestly's operation as it enables the app to provide suggestions directly within the Zoom client. This ability is at the heart of Suggestly's functionality, enabling it to deliver real-time FAQ responses efficiently during your Zoom meetings.</li><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>user:read:</strong></span> Suggestly requires this scope to uphold data privacy and security standards. This scope allows the app to authenticate user identities and permissions, ensuring that the real-time FAQ responses are delivered only to authorized users during a Zoom meeting.</li><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>meeting:read: </strong></span> This scope is critical for Suggestly's functionality. It permits the app to accurately identify each meeting participant. This ability allows Suggestly to make relevant suggestions based on the conversation context and each participant's role within the call.</li><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>meeting:write:</strong></span> This scope is vital for Suggestly to provide a seamless user experience. By having this permission, Suggestly can automatically fetch information about the meeting lifecycle events like when a meeting is created or started. As a result, users don't need to manually input this information, making the app more intuitive and user-friendly.</li><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>meeting_token:read:local_recording: </strong></span> This scope is pivotal for Suggestly to access and process the real-time audio stream from your Zoom meetings. The obtained local recording meeting tokens are used to power Suggestly's transcription feature. As a result, Suggestly can listen in real-time, transcribe the conversation, and generate contextually relevant suggestions during your Zoom meetings. This scope is critical for the fundamental functionality of the Suggestly app.</li></ul></div><h3 class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">1.3 Real-Time Zoom Streaming Data</h3><div class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">Suggestly captures and processes the real-time streaming data of your Zoom calls to provide its core functionality. Here's why this data capture is necessary:</div><div class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><ul><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>Real-Time FAQ Responses:</strong></span> Suggestly uses the real-time audio and video streams of your Zoom calls to generate on-the-spot FAQ responses. The app listens to the conversations, identifies relevant questions or topics, and provides immediate responses based on the pre-loaded FAQ documents. This real-time processing allows for efficient and timely communication during your Zoom meetings.</li><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>Contextual Information: </strong></span> Capturing real-time streaming data enables Suggestly to understand the context of the ongoing conversation. This contextual understanding is paramount in delivering accurate and relevant responses to the participants, contributing to a more productive and engaging meeting experience.</li><li><span class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n"><strong>User Experience Personalization:</strong></span>The real-time streaming data helps Suggestly adapt to the dynamics of the conversation. It allows the app to adjust the nature and timing of its responses according to the flow of the meeting, enhancing the overall user experience.</li></ul></div><h3 class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">1.4 Application Use Data</h3><div class="ant-typography css-1xg9z9n">As part of the regular operation of Suggestly, we collect standard application use data to improve your experience, secure your interactions, and streamline our service.
