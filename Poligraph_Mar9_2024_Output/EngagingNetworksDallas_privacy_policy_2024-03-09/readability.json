These provide that personal data must be:</p><ul><li>Processed fairly and lawfully and transparently</li><li>Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (\u201cpurpose limitation\u201d)</li><li>Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (\u201cdata minimisation\u201d)</li><li>Accurate and up to date</li><li>Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed (\u201cstorage limitation\u201d)</li><li>Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (\u201cintegrity and confidentiality\u201d)</li></ul><p>Engaging Networks is responsible for our clients\u2019, their supporters\u2019 and our employee\u2019s personal data and must be able to demonstrate compliance with all of the above principles through our policies, actions and documentation.</p><h4><strong>Fair, Transparent and lawful processing</strong></h4><p>GDPR is intended not to prevent the processing of personal data, but to ensure that it is done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject. The data subject must be told who the data controller is (in this case Engaging Networks), the purpose for which the data is to be processed by Engaging Networks, and the identities of anyone to whom the data may be disclosed or transferred. For personal data to be processed lawfully by Engaging Networks, at least one of the following conditions must be met:</p><ol><li>That the data subject has explicitly consented to the processing</li><li>that the processing forms part of a contract or steps taken at the request of the data subject to enter a contract</li><li>that the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the data controller&nbsp;or by a third party</li><li>processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller</li><li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject</li><li>processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person</li></ol><p>When sensitive personal data is being processed, additional conditions must be met to ensure highly levels of protection and security. In most cases the data subject\u2019s explicit consent to the processing of such data will be required.</p><h4><strong>Purpose limitation</strong></h4><p>Personal data may only be processed for the specific purposes notified to the data subject when the data was first collected or for any other purposes specifically permitted by GDPR. This means that personal data must not be collected for one purpose and then used for another. If it becomes necessary to change the purpose for which the data is processed, the data subject must be informed and explicit consent given before any processing occurs.</p><h4><strong>Data minimisation</strong></h4><p>Personal data should only be collected to the extent that it is required for the specific purpose notified to the data subject or as instructed by our clients. Any data which is not necessary for that purpose should not be collected in the first place.</p><h4><strong>Accurate data</strong></h4><p>Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date. Information which is incorrect or misleading is not accurate and steps should therefore be taken to check the accuracy of any personal data at the point of collection and at regular intervals afterwards. Inaccurate or out-of-date data should be destroyed.</p><h4><strong>Storage limitation</strong></h4><p>Personal data should not be kept longer than is necessary for the purpose. This means that data is destroyed or erased from Engaging Networks systems when it is no longer required.</p><h3>9.&nbsp;Data Subjects\u2019 Rights</h3><p>Data must be processed in line with data subjects\u2019 rights. Data subjects have a right to:</p><ul><li><strong>Request access</strong>&nbsp;to any data held about them by a data controller. Commonly known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d, this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li><li><strong>Have any inaccurate personal data corrected or updated (rectified).</strong>&nbsp;This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected or appended. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li><li><strong>Object to the processing</strong>&nbsp;of your data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</li><li><strong>Request erasure of your data</strong>. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li><li><strong>Restrict the processing of personal data.</strong>&nbsp;This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li><li><strong>Transfer personal data</strong>&nbsp;to a third party on request, where the data was obtained by consent or contract.&nbsp; We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li><li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time&nbsp;</strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li></ul><h3>10.&nbsp;Data security</h3><p>Engaging Networks must ensure that appropriate security measures are taken against unlawful or unauthorised processing of personal data, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, personal data. Data subjects may apply to the courts for compensation if they have suffered damage from such a loss. GDPR requires Engaging Networks to put in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security of all personal data from the point of collection to the point of destruction. Personal data may only be transferred to a third-party data processor if we have full agreement from the controller and the third-party agrees to comply with those procedures and policies and or if they put in place adequate measures themselves. Maintaining data security means guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the personal data, defined as follows:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<strong>Confidentiality&nbsp;</strong>means that only people who are authorised to use the data can access it</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;means that personal data should be accurate and suitable for the purpose for which it is processed</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Availability</strong>&nbsp;means that authorised users should be able to access the data if they need it for authorised purposes. Personal data should therefore be stored on the Engaging Networks\u2019 central computer system (data centre)</li></ul><p>In the event of an incident affecting the security of personal data as Processor, it is Engaging Networks\u2019 responsibility to notify our clients (Controllers) as soon as the issue is detected.</p><h3>Other Policies</h3><h4><strong>Compliance and Security Commitments</strong></h4><p>Engaging Networks designs its system processes and procedures to meet its objectives which are based on the service commitments it makes to user entities, the laws, and regulations that govern the provision of the services, and the financial, operational, and compliance requirements that the company has established for the services. The system services are subject to the Security, Availability, and Privacy commitments established internally for its services.

These provide that personal data must be:Processed fairly and lawfully and transparentlyCollected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (\u201cpurpose limitation\u201d)Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (\u201cdata minimisation\u201d)Accurate and up to dateKept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed (\u201cstorage limitation\u201d)Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (\u201cintegrity and confidentiality\u201d)Engaging Networks is responsible for our clients\u2019, their supporters\u2019 and our employee\u2019s personal data and must be able to demonstrate compliance with all of the above principles through our policies, actions and documentation.Fair, Transparent and lawful processingGDPR is intended not to prevent the processing of personal data, but to ensure that it is done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject. The data subject must be told who the data controller is (in this case Engaging Networks), the purpose for which the data is to be processed by Engaging Networks, and the identities of anyone to whom the data may be disclosed or transferred. For personal data to be processed lawfully by Engaging Networks, at least one of the following conditions must be met:That the data subject has explicitly consented to the processingthat the processing forms part of a contract or steps taken at the request of the data subject to enter a contractthat the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the data controller\u00a0or by a third partyprocessing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controllerprocessing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subjectprocessing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural personWhen sensitive personal data is being processed, additional conditions must be met to ensure highly levels of protection and security. In most cases the data subject\u2019s explicit consent to the processing of such data will be required.Purpose limitationPersonal data may only be processed for the specific purposes notified to the data subject when the data was first collected or for any other purposes specifically permitted by GDPR. This means that personal data must not be collected for one purpose and then used for another. If it becomes necessary to change the purpose for which the data is processed, the data subject must be informed and explicit consent given before any processing occurs.Data minimisationPersonal data should only be collected to the extent that it is required for the specific purpose notified to the data subject or as instructed by our clients. Any data which is not necessary for that purpose should not be collected in the first place.Accurate dataPersonal data must be accurate and kept up to date. Information which is incorrect or misleading is not accurate and steps should therefore be taken to check the accuracy of any personal data at the point of collection and at regular intervals afterwards. Inaccurate or out-of-date data should be destroyed.Storage limitationPersonal data should not be kept longer than is necessary for the purpose. This means that data is destroyed or erased from Engaging Networks systems when it is no longer required.9.\u00a0Data Subjects\u2019 RightsData must be processed in line with data subjects\u2019 rights. Data subjects have a right to:Request access\u00a0to any data held about them by a data controller. Commonly known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d, this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.Have any inaccurate personal data corrected or updated (rectified).\u00a0This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected or appended. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.Object to the processing\u00a0of your data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.Request erasure of your data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.Restrict the processing of personal data.\u00a0This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.Transfer personal data\u00a0to a third party on request, where the data was obtained by consent or contract.\u00a0 We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.Withdraw consent at any time\u00a0where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.10.\u00a0Data securityEngaging Networks must ensure that appropriate security measures are taken against unlawful or unauthorised processing of personal data, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, personal data. Data subjects may apply to the courts for compensation if they have suffered damage from such a loss. GDPR requires Engaging Networks to put in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security of all personal data from the point of collection to the point of destruction. Personal data may only be transferred to a third-party data processor if we have full agreement from the controller and the third-party agrees to comply with those procedures and policies and or if they put in place adequate measures themselves. Maintaining data security means guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the personal data, defined as follows:\u00a0Confidentiality\u00a0means that only people who are authorised to use the data can access it\u00a0Integrity\u00a0means that personal data should be accurate and suitable for the purpose for which it is processed\u00a0Availability\u00a0means that authorised users should be able to access the data if they need it for authorised purposes. Personal data should therefore be stored on the Engaging Networks\u2019 central computer system (data centre)In the event of an incident affecting the security of personal data as Processor, it is Engaging Networks\u2019 responsibility to notify our clients (Controllers) as soon as the issue is detected.Other PoliciesCompliance and Security CommitmentsEngaging Networks designs its system processes and procedures to meet its objectives which are based on the service commitments it makes to user entities, the laws, and regulations that govern the provision of the services, and the financial, operational, and compliance requirements that the company has established for the services.
