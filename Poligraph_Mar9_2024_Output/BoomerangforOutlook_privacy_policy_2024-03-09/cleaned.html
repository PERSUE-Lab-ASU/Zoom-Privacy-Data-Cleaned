<p>We do not control the collection and use of your information collected by third parties described above in Disclosure of Your Information. When possible, these organizations are under contractual obligations to use this data only for providing the services to us and to maintain this information strictly confidential. These third parties may, however, aggregate the information they collect with information from their other customers for their own purposes. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of the recipients of your Communications, who may forward them to other third parties or otherwise disclose them.</p>
<p>In addition, we strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Data you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with control over your Personal Data: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promotional Offers from Baydin.</strong> We will only use your contact information to promote our own products and services with your express consent. If you wish to consent to such use, you can check the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your Personal Data, authenticate, or otherwise seek such consent. If you wish to change your choice, you may do so at any time by logging into the Websites and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by sending us an email stating your request to support@baydin.com. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email to be omitted from future email distributions.

If you wish to change your choice, you may do so at any time by logging into the Websites and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by sending us an email stating your request to support@baydin.com.

</ul>
<h3>11.	Your Rights Regarding Your Information and Accessing and Correcting Your Information</h3>

<blockquote>You may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws, including the right to access and update your Personal Data, restrict how it is used, transfer certain Personal Data to another controller, withdraw your consent at any time, and the right to have us erase certain Personal Data about you. You also have the right to complain to a supervisory authority about our processing of your Personal Data. </blockquote>
 
<p>Applicable data protection laws may provide you with certain rights with regards to our processing of your Personal Data. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access and Update.</strong> You can review and change your Personal Data by notifying us through the contact information below of any changes or errors in any Personal Data we have about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. We may not be able to accommodate your request if we believe it would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. </li>
<li><strong>Restrictions.</strong> You have the right to restrict our processing of your Personal Data under certain circumstances. In particular, you can request we restrict our use of it if you contest its accuracy, if the processing of your Personal Data is determined to be unlawful, or if we no longer need your Personal Data for processing, but we have retained it as permitted by law. </li>
<li><strong>Portability.</strong> To the extent the Personal Data you provide Baydin is processed based on your consent or that we process it through automated means, you have the right to request that we provide you a copy of, or access to, all or part of such Personal Data in structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transmit this Personal Data to another controller, when technically feasible. </li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent.</strong> To the extent that our processing of your Personal Data is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by closing your account. Withdrawing your consent will not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal, and will not affect the lawfulness of our continued processing that is based on any other lawful basis for processing your Personal Data. </li>
<li><strong>Right to be Forgotten.</strong> You have the right to request that we delete all of your Personal Data. We cannot delete your Personal Data except by also deleting your user account, and we will only delete your account when we no longer have a lawful basis for processing your Personal Data or after a final determination that your Personal Data was unlawfully processed. We may not accommodate a request to erase information if we believe the deletion would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. In all other cases, we will retain your Personal Data as set forth in this policy. In addition, we cannot completely delete your Personal Data as some data may rest in previous backups. These will be retained for the periods set forth in our disaster recovery policies. If you delete your Communications from the your email or calendar service or client, copies of your Communications may remain viewable in cached and archived pages on websites used to access your calendar or email, or might have been copied or stored by recipients of your Communications. </li>
<li><strong>Complaints.</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority in the country you live in, the country you work in, or the country where you believe your rights under applicable data protection laws have been violated. However, before doing so, we request that you contact us directly in order to give us an opportunity to work directly with you to resolve any concerns about your privacy. </li>
<li><strong>How You May Exercise Your Rights.</strong> You may exercise any of the above rights by contacting us through any of the methods below or through the "Get in Touch" link on our Websites. If you contact us to exercise any of the foregoing rights, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. We reserve the right to limit or deny your request if you have failed to provide sufficient information to verify your identity or to satisfy our legal and business requirements. </li>
</ul>
<h3>12.	Do Not Track Signals</h3>

<blockquote>We may use automated data collection technologies to track you across websites. We currently do not honor do-not-track signals that may be sent by some browsers.</blockquote>
 
<p>We also may use automated data collection technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking).  Some web browsers permit you to broadcast a signal to websites and online services indicating a preference that they "do not track" your online activities. At this time, we do not honor such signals and we do not modify what information we collect or how we use that information based upon whether such signal is broadcast or received.</p>
<h3>13.	Data Security</h3>
