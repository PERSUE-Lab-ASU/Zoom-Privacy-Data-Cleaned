Thanks for checking out our Privacy Policy (the \"Policy\"). Privacy's\na big issue, and one that we take seriously, so we ask that you read this document\ncarefully so that you're aware of what happens to your data on Alumnifire.</p>\n\n<p>In the Policy, we cover:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our philosophy about privacy and data ownership.</li>\n<li>What types of information we collect about you.</li>\n<li>How and why we collect that information.</li>\n<li>How your information is used.</li>\n<li>Where we store it and our security practices.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, yeah, important stuff. Also, you'll want to read our <a href=\"file:///terms\">Terms of Service</a>.\nThat document is our contract with you governing your use of Alumnifire. You can't\nuse the Service without agreeing to it. It also incorporates this Policy by\nreference, and it defines a number of key words and definitions, which all mean the\nsame things here in the Policy as they do in the Terms.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, before we get started, the terms <strong>\"using\"</strong> and <strong>\"processing\"</strong>\ninformation broadly refer to a collection of data activities. When we use those\nterms in this document, you should assume that they can refer to any and all of the\nfollowing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using cookies on a computer.</li>\n<li>Analyzing collected information and using or handling such information in any way.</li>\n<li>Collecting, storing, or deleting information.</li>\n<li>Evaluating, modifying, or combining information.</li>\n<li>Disclosing or transferring information within our organization or among any\naffiliates based in the United States or internationally.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And now, on with the show...</p>\n\n<h4>1. Our philosophy about privacy</h4>\n\n<p>We believe you have a right to control how your data is used. We believe in being\ncrystal clear with you about what we do with your data. We also believe you should\nbe able to \"pack up and go\" at any time.</p>\n\n<p>This Policy covers a lot, so here\u2019s a quick summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>By signing up for the site in general, you should expect to make the data you\nupload available to other people. You're signing up for a networking site, so you\nshould expect that we need to show your name, job, etc. to other members who are\nlooking to network with you.</li>\n<li>Sometimes we'll ask for sensitive information in order to serve you better, like\nwhether you're looking for a job. In these cases, we'll generally mention what we\nplan to do with this information at the time you're uploading it. If we don't say\nanything specific, assume other members of the site will have access to it.</li>\n<li>If you delete your account, we don't keep any of your account data. There may be\noccasions where we need to keep some content you've created or uploaded. For\nexample, if you've sent a message to someone else through the platform, we'll keep a\nrecord of the message for that other person. If you've included personal data in\nsuch a message, we probably won't be able to tell so we won't be able to remove it.\nFor this reason (among others) we recommend that you not include Personal\nInformation in messages you send to other users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you think our policies aren't clear, fair, or that we aren't following them, we\nencourage you to get in touch with us via the contact information at the bottom of\nthe Policy.</p>\n\n<h5>1.1 Scope of the Policy</h5>\n\n<p>We're not responsible for the privacy and security practices of other companies and\nwebsites. The Policy covers only information that you provide us through your use of\nthe Service.</p>\n\n<p>The Service may contain links to other websites or services. Those links don't\nrepresent endorsements of those services, and if you visit them, we are not\nresponsible for the privacy or security of any information you upload there. Always\nread the terms of service and privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>\n\n<p>We may also partner with other companies or use their products to offer additional\nfeatures. We work with companies that offer high quality and trusted products and\nservices, but we are not responsible for their privacy and security practices.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, we may partner with your school or institution. If we do, we still\nmaintain separate privacy and security practices. We also ask your permission before\nsharing any of your Personal Information with a school or institution.</p>\n\n<h5>1.2. Updates to the Policy</h5>\n\n<p>From time to time, we may update the Policy. Sometimes those changes will be small,\nlike correcting typos or changing the wording of a phrase or two. We won't bother\nyou when that happens. But when a change is material, we'll either email all of the\nregistered users of the site, or we'll post a conspicuous notice on the Site or App\nprior to the change becoming effective.</p>\n\n<p>Every time you use the Service, you consent to the Policy in place at the time you\nuse it. As such, your continued use of the Service after a change to the Policy\nconstitutes your consent to that change. If you wish to opt out, you can delete your\naccount by accessing your settings on the site.</p>\n\n<h5>1.3 Children</h5>\n\n<p>It's our policy that we don't allow children under age 13 to use the Service, and we\ndo not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under 13.\nAdditionally, we require that anyone younger than 18 interested in using the Service\nobtain their parent or guardian's consent.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a parent or guardian and find that your child has provided Personal\nInformation on our Service without your consent, email us. We will make all\nreasonable efforts to delete such information from our databases.</p>\n\n<h4>2. What types of information we collect about you</h4>\n\n<p>We collect information from you because without it, there'd be no Alumnifire. Some\nlevel of Personal Information is required to help members of alumni networks to\nconnect with each other.</p>\n\n<p>The information we collect can be classified as follows:</p>\n\n<h5>2.1 Personal Information</h5>\n\n<p><strong>\"Personal Information\"</strong> is information that can be used to identify you\npersonally. You can take advantage of some basic features without providing Personal\nInformation, but to register for the Service or take advantage of all the features,\nyou'll need to provide information that qualifies as Personal Information, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>identifying information like your name and profile picture;</li>\n<li>contact information like your email address, phone number, or mailing address;</li>\n<li>login information like your username and password;</li>\n<li>biographic information like your job history, education history skills,\ncertifications, interests, needs, or expertise;</li>\n<li>payment information like your credit card number, expiration date, security code,\nbilling address and other billing details, bank account number, or bank routing\nnumber.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>2.2 Settings</h5>\n\n<p><strong>\"Settings\"</strong> are personal preferences that you can select to tailor the Service\nthe way you want it. Settings are not Personal Information (they can't identify you\npersonally).</p>\n\n<h5>2.3 Log Data</h5>\n\n<p><strong>\"Log Data\"</strong> are sent to us from your browser when you visit our Service. These\ninclude your computer's IP address, your browser type, other webpages you've visited\nor transactions you've completed, certain demographic information like your physical\nlocation, and other statistics. Log Data do not constitute Personal Information nor\nare they treated as such.</p>\n\n<h5>2.4 Interactive Information</h5>\n\n<p><strong>\"Interactive Information\"</strong> is how you interact with the site. When you do\nsomething on the site, the fact that you did something constitutes Interactive\nInformation. This could be pages you visit, the amount of time you spend on those\npages, search terms that you enter, Exchanges that you complete, Members with whom\nyou communicate, specific times you access the Service, or other things. Interactive\nInformation alone is not Personal Information.</p>\n\n<h5>2.5 Cookies</h5>\n\n<p><strong>\"Cookies\"</strong> are small data files that we transfer to your computer, through your\nbrowser, for record-keeping. Cookie usage is a common practice for many websites.</p>\n\n<p>When you log off the Service or close your browser, your computer will delete\nsession Cookies but keep persistent Cookies. Many browsers allow you to turn \"off\"\nCookies or prompt you before accepting a Cookie from websites you visit. Choosing\nnot to accept Cookies will affect the functionality of the Service.</p>\n\n<h5>2.6 Web Beacons</h5>\n\n<p><strong>\"Web Beacons\"</strong> are electronic images (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) used\nalong with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze the performance of\nan online service.</p>\n\n<h5>2.7 Third Party Information</h5>\n\n<p><strong>\"Third Party Information\"</strong> is information about you made available from third-\nparty sources. As described in the <a href=\"file:///terms\">Terms</a>, you can register to use the\nService by logging into a SN Account (for example, your LinkedIn or Facebook\naccounts). If you do, you will be giving us access to some Personal Information\ncontained in that SN Account (commonly your real name, email address, profile\npicture, friends or connections on that SN, groups you've joined on that SN, and\nother publicly available information you've added to that SN).</p>\n\n<p>Please remember that we do not control the privacy practices of these SN services,\nand we encourage you to read their respective privacy policies.</p>\n\n<h4>3. How we'll use your information</h4>\n\n<p>We use your information only 1) as described in this Privacy Policy, 2) as\ndescribed to you on the Site or App at the time you provide it, 3) in other ways\nwith your express consent, or 4) as required by law or compulsory legal process.</p>\n\n<p>We use your information to provide the following services to you:</p>\n\n<h5>3.1 Account and Profile</h5>\n\n<p>When you sign up for Alumnifire, we create an Alumnifire Account and a profile page\nfor you. To create these, we use some of your Personal Information entered by you\nor provided as a part of Third Party Information, as well as Settings selected by\nyou.</p>\n\n<p>Your profile page is publicly visible to other users of the Service and consequently\nshould reflect how much you want others to know about you. Be careful and protect\ninformation you consider sensitive and wouldn't want made public. You can always\nedit your profile information via the Service.</p>\n\n<p>Some of your Personal Information is not included in your profile and will not be\nshared with other users or third parties. For example, we'd never share your login\nor payment information with a third party. We also do not share contact information\nwith other users, and we'd ask your specific permission before sharing it with your\nschool or another organization.</p>\n\n<p>In very specific circumstances, where it is obvious that we are working directly\nwith a partner organization, we will share your information back with that\norganization by default. You can always opt-out of having this information shared.\nA full list of partner organizations where we share information by default is\nlisted in section 8 of the Policy.</p>\n\n<p>Your Settings are used to optimize the site to your preferences. They are not\nvisible to others and we do not share them with third parties, but we may use\naggregated Settings data to analyze and improve the service.</p>\n\n<h5>3.2 Notifications</h5>\n\n<p>We'll send you notifications when something happens that might interest you, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Another member sends you a message</li>\n<li>There is new activity or Content on the Site or App</li>\n<li>We've added a new feature to the Service</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>or when there's something you need to know, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your profile is incomplete</li>\n<li>We've made a change to the Terms or Policy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We use your Personal Information and Settings to determine what notifications you\nreceive, and we'll use contact information like your email address, phone number,\nor mailing address to contact you.</p>\n\n<h5>3.3 Marketing</h5>\n\n<p>In addition to notifications, we may also contact you with newsletters, marketing\nor promotional materials, and other Content that may be of interest to you. We'll\nadd settings to your profile so you can always opt out of any marketing or\npromotional material we plan to send.</p>\n\n<p>Note: you cannot opt-out of certain notifications related to your use of the\nService.</p>\n\n<h5>3.4 Referrals</h5>\n\n<p>You can invite or refer friends and colleagues to our Service. To do that, you'll\noften need to enter a friend's email address or select his or her social media\naccount from a list. Typically, we use this information to send a one-time email or\nmessage and we do not store any information about your friend afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>We may also offer a feature that allows you to import contacts from an address book\nand use those contacts to send invites. In such a case, we ask for a username and\npassword for an email account, but we do not store that information once your\ncontacts have been imported.</p>\n\n<h5>3.5 Paid product and service offerings</h5>\n\n<p>We may, in the future, provide you the ability to offer paid products and/or\nservices to other members. The details of your offer(s) are considered Member\nContent. We may publish, use, share or otherwise disclose that Member Content\npublicly via the Service and may enable third parties to publish the offering on\ntheir websites.</p>\n\n<h5>3.6 Testimonials</h5>\n\n<p>We may post testimonials about our Service on the Site or App, and we may even ask\nyou to provide one. If you choose to provide one, we would share it publicly along\nwith any Personal Information you consent to include. If you change your mind and\nwant a testimonial removed, contact us.</p>\n\n<h5>3.7 Requests</h5>\n\n<p>You may send us requests from time to time, like a request for a demonstration of\nthe Service, or a request for help navigating the site or to report a bug, or a\nrequest for us to create an Alumnifire site for your organization. When you do,\nyou'll need to enter certain details and contact information, which we will use to\ncontact you. In most cases, such information will be sent to the Alumnifire team,\nbut not stored in our databases.</p>\n\n<h5>3.8 Design and customization</h5>\n\n<p>We may use aspects of the Log Data from your browser and session Cookies to\ncustomize the site to your device, browser, screen size, location, and more.</p>\n\n<h5>3.9 Bookmarking</h5>\n\n<p>We may use aspects of your Interactive Information to store areas of the site you\nregularly visit, other members with whom you regularly communicate, or particular\nContent you regularly view so that you can access those things more quickly.</p>\n\n<h5>3.10 Persistent log-in</h5>\n\n<p>We may use aspects of your Log Data, like your IP address, as well as persistent\nCookies to identify you so that you don't have to log in every time you visit our\nService.</p>\n\n<h5>3.11 Analysis</h5>\n\n<p>We use your Log Data, Interactive Information, session Cookies, and Web Beacons in\nan aggregated and anonymized fashion to analyze the performance of our Service. Such\nanalysis helps us improve the functionality of the Service and better tailor our\ncontent and product to suit our users' needs.</p>\n\n<p>Currently we use Google Analytics, although in the future we may use other\nanalytics services, to collect and enable many of the analytics tracking features\nwe describe here. Some anonymized Interactive Information is stored on Google\nservers.</p>\n\n<p>A note about Web Beacons: typically, our use of Web Beacons is limited to the\nimplementation of them by a technology partner or service provider who offers us\nanalytic services. For example, we currently use Mailgun and Mailchimp to send you\nemails (and may use others in the future). Both providers include Web Beacons in\nemails they send in order to determine if you've opened the email.</p>\n\n<h5>3.12 Institutional Users</h5>\n\n<p>In most cases, we have a client relationship with the institution underlying each\nalumni community on Alumnifire. Employees of those institutions will typically have\naccounts that they can use to access some information about you. We may offer the\ninstitution access to analytics and data about the performance of our Service within\ntheir community. Such analytics and data would contain aggregated and anonymized Log\nData and Interactive Information. Employee accounts would also be able to access\nyour public profile and the Personal Information within by visiting your profile page\non the Service. We may also offer them the ability to download such information on all\nof their constituents in aggregate within the Service. When we do this, however, we\ntreat your contact information (email address, phone number, etc.) separately from\nthe other information in your profile. You have the ability to prevent the institution\nfrom downloading your contact information via a setting in your account.</p>\n\n<h5>3.13 Third Party Users</h5>\n\n<p>We may allow third parties who did not attend your particular school or were not a\npart of your particular organization, such as recruiters, to access and use the\nService. In such a case, we may offer a way for you to make your profile available\nto those third parties if you so choose. Such access to your information would require\nyour explicit opt-in via a setting in your account.</p>\n\n<h4>4. Sharing and disclosing your information</h4>\n\n<p>We share or disclose your information only 1) as described in this Privacy Policy,\n2) as described to you on the Site or App at the time you provide it, 3) in other\nways with your express consent, or 4) as required by law or compulsory legal\nprocess.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the uses described above, we make your information available to other\ncompanies, services, or people in the following cases:</p>\n\n<h5>4.1 Analysis</h5>\n\n<p>We may share aggregated information with third parties for analysis such as\nindustry analysis, demographic profiling, payment processing, customer service and\nother purposes. In cases where we do this, any aggregated information shared in\nthese contexts is limited to Settings, Log Data, Interactive Information, or\ninformation derived from Cookies or Web Beacons. Such information will be\naggregated and will not contain your Personal Information.</p>\n\n<h5>4.2 Third party services</h5>\n\n<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to perform Site or App\nmaintenance, database management, analytics support, data processing or email and\ntext message distribution. These third parties have access to your information only\nto perform these tasks on our behalf.</p>\n\n<h5>4.3 Mergers and acquisitions</h5>\n\n<p>If Alumnifire is acquired by or merged with another company or a similar corporate\ntransaction takes place, we may share information about you with the other company.\nIn such a case, we will notify you with a prominent notice on the Site or App or by\nsending notice to the email address listed in your account before transferring\nyour information.</p>\n\n<h5>4.4 Legal investigations</h5>\n\n<p>We may share information about you to prevent or take action regarding illegal\nactivities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical\nsafety or other rights and interests of any person, violations of Alumnifire's\n<a href=\"file:///terms\">Terms of Service</a>, or as otherwise required by law or compulsory legal\nprocess.</p>\n\n<h5>4.5 Compliance</h5>\n\n<p>We may share information about you for legal compliance in response to subpoenas,\nsearch warrants, judicial proceedings, court orders, legal process, or other law\nenforcement measures, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend\nagainst legal claims.</p>\n\n<h4>5. Updating and deleting your information</h4>\n\n<p>You can modify or delete Personal Information in your profile by editing your\nprofile directly via the Site or App. You can also deactivate or delete your\nAlumnifire account entirely within your account settings. In either case, keep in\nmind that your Member Content will remain publicly viewable via the Site and\nApp.</p>\n\n<h4>6. Security measures</h4>\n\n<p>To protect your privacy and information, Alumnifire uses multiple security\nprocedures and practices to protect the Personal Information of users. While we\nbelieve that we meet or exceed industry standards to protect your Personal\nInformation, no method of transferring such information over the internet or\nstoring it digitally is 100% secure, nor can we guarantee the absolute security of\nyour information. If you have any questions about security on our Service, email us.</p>\n\n<h5>6.1 General security</h5>\n\n<p>When you enter Personal Information on our Service, we encrypt that information\nusing secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is a web security standard that\ncreates a secure connection between our web servers and your browser and protects\nyour data from unauthorized access. Your Personal Information is password-protected\nand our main servers are locked and hosted by a leading provider. Access to the\nhost environment is secure.</p>\n\n<h5>6.2 Phishing</h5>\n\n<p><strong>We will never request your credit card or banking information, your Alumnifire\nAccount ID, login password, or any other private Personal Information in a non\nsecure or unsolicited email or phone call.</strong> If someone claiming to represent\nAlumnifire does ask for such information unsolicited, DO NOT provide it.</p>\n\n<h5>6.3 Protect your information: keep communication within the platform</h5>\n\n<p>Communications and Exchanges should be performed exclusively using our Service.\nKeeping communication within the Service protects you and your information. Do not\nrequest personal email addresses, Skype usernames, phone numbers, or other personal\ncontact details from other users of the Service. Sharing personal information with\nand contacting other users outside of the Service may put you at risk.</p>\n\n<h5>6.4 Disclosure of breaches</h5>\n\n<p>We will of course make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the\nsecurity, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored\n\"personal data\" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach\nnotification). These notices will be done via email or conspicuous posting on the\nSite or App as quickly as possible and without unreasonable delay, taking into\nconsideration the legitimate needs of law enforcement or any measures necessary to\ndetermine the scope of the breach and restore the integrity of the Service. In\nother words, if we need to stay quiet about a breach to help the good guys catch\nthe bad ones, we'll do that until the coast is clear.</p>\n\n<h4>7. Jurisdictions and international transfer</h4>\n\n<p>Alumnifire operates in the United States and processes information described in this\npolicy here in the U.S. Additionally, we work and share data as described in this\npolicy with third parties who may perform their activities in other countries. As a\nresult, your information as shared with Alumnifire and our partners may be subject\nto the laws of jurisdictions outside your own, and those laws may not afford the\nsame privacy and data protection laws as your home jurisdiction's, particularly\nregarding demands or requests for information from government entities. By using\nour Service, you agree that your information may be collected, transferred, stored,\nand processed in the United States and in other countries.</p>\n\n<h4>8.

How we'll use your information\n\nWe use your information only 1) as described in this Privacy Policy, 2) as\ndescribed to you on the Site or App at the time you provide it, 3) in other ways\nwith your express consent, or 4) as required by law or compulsory legal process.\n\nWe use your information to provide the following services to you:\n\n3.1 Account and Profile\n\nWhen you sign up for Alumnifire, we create an Alumnifire Account and a profile page\nfor you. To create these, we use some of your Personal Information entered by you\nor provided as a part of Third Party Information, as well as Settings selected by\nyou.\n\nYour profile page is publicly visible to other users of the Service and consequently\nshould reflect how much you want others to know about you. Be careful and protect\ninformation you consider sensitive and wouldn't want made public. You can always\nedit your profile information via the Service.\n\nSome of your Personal Information is not included in your profile and will not be\nshared with other users or third parties. For example, we'd never share your login\nor payment information with a third party. We also do not share contact information\nwith other users, and we'd ask your specific permission before sharing it with your\nschool or another organization.\n\nIn very specific circumstances, where it is obvious that we are working directly\nwith a partner organization, we will share your information back with that\norganization by default. You can always opt-out of having this information shared.\nA full list of partner organizations where we share information by default is\nlisted in section 8 of the Policy.\n\nYour Settings are used to optimize the site to your preferences. They are not\nvisible to others and we do not share them with third parties, but we may use\naggregated Settings data to analyze and improve the service.\n\n3.2 Notifications\n\nWe'll send you notifications when something happens that might interest you, like:\n\n\nAnother member sends you a message\nThere is new activity or Content on the Site or App\nWe've added a new feature to the Service\n\n\nor when there's something you need to know, like:\n\n\nYour profile is incomplete\nWe've made a change to the Terms or Policy\n\n\nWe use your Personal Information and Settings to determine what notifications you\nreceive, and we'll use contact information like your email address, phone number,\nor mailing address to contact you.\n\n3.3 Marketing\n\nIn addition to notifications, we may also contact you with newsletters, marketing\nor promotional materials, and other Content that may be of interest to you. We'll\nadd settings to your profile so you can always opt out of any marketing or\npromotional material we plan to send.\n\nNote: you cannot opt-out of certain notifications related to your use of the\nService.\n\n3.4 Referrals\n\nYou can invite or refer friends and colleagues to our Service. To do that, you'll\noften need to enter a friend's email address or select his or her social media\naccount from a list. Typically, we use this information to send a one-time email or\nmessage and we do not store any information about your friend afterwards.\n\nWe may also offer a feature that allows you to import contacts from an address book\nand use those contacts to send invites. In such a case, we ask for a username and\npassword for an email account, but we do not store that information once your\ncontacts have been imported.\n\n3.5 Paid product and service offerings\n\nWe may, in the future, provide you the ability to offer paid products and/or\nservices to other members. The details of your offer(s) are considered Member\nContent. We may publish, use, share or otherwise disclose that Member Content\npublicly via the Service and may enable third parties to publish the offering on\ntheir websites.\n\n3.6 Testimonials\n\nWe may post testimonials about our Service on the Site or App, and we may even ask\nyou to provide one. If you choose to provide one, we would share it publicly along\nwith any Personal Information you consent to include. If you change your mind and\nwant a testimonial removed, contact us.\n\n3.7 Requests\n\nYou may send us requests from time to time, like a request for a demonstration of\nthe Service, or a request for help navigating the site or to report a bug, or a\nrequest for us to create an Alumnifire site for your organization. When you do,\nyou'll need to enter certain details and contact information, which we will use to\ncontact you. In most cases, such information will be sent to the Alumnifire team,\nbut not stored in our databases.\n\n3.8 Design and customization\n\nWe may use aspects of the Log Data from your browser and session Cookies to\ncustomize the site to your device, browser, screen size, location, and more.\n\n3.9 Bookmarking\n\nWe may use aspects of your Interactive Information to store areas of the site you\nregularly visit, other members with whom you regularly communicate, or particular\nContent you regularly view so that you can access those things more quickly.\n\n3.10 Persistent log-in\n\nWe may use aspects of your Log Data, like your IP address, as well as persistent\nCookies to identify you so that you don't have to log in every time you visit our\nService.\n\n3.11 Analysis\n\nWe use your Log Data, Interactive Information, session Cookies, and Web Beacons in\nan aggregated and anonymized fashion to analyze the performance of our Service. Such\nanalysis helps us improve the functionality of the Service and better tailor our\ncontent and product to suit our users' needs.\n\nCurrently we use Google Analytics, although in the future we may use other\nanalytics services, to collect and enable many of the analytics tracking features\nwe describe here. Some anonymized Interactive Information is stored on Google\nservers.\n\nA note about Web Beacons: typically, our use of Web Beacons is limited to the\nimplementation of them by a technology partner or service provider who offers us\nanalytic services. For example, we currently use Mailgun and Mailchimp to send you\nemails (and may use others in the future). Both providers include Web Beacons in\nemails they send in order to determine if you've opened the email.\n\n3.12 Institutional Users\n\nIn most cases, we have a client relationship with the institution underlying each\nalumni community on Alumnifire. Employees of those institutions will typically have\naccounts that they can use to access some information about you. We may offer the\ninstitution access to analytics and data about the performance of our Service within\ntheir community. Such analytics and data would contain aggregated and anonymized Log\nData and Interactive Information. Employee accounts would also be able to access\nyour public profile and the Personal Information within by visiting your profile page\non the Service. We may also offer them the ability to download such information on all\nof their constituents in aggregate within the Service. When we do this, however, we\ntreat your contact information (email address, phone number, etc.) separately from\nthe other information in your profile. You have the ability to prevent the institution\nfrom downloading your contact information via a setting in your account.\n\n3.13 Third Party Users\n\nWe may allow third parties who did not attend your particular school or were not a\npart of your particular organization, such as recruiters, to access and use the\nService. In such a case, we may offer a way for you to make your profile available\nto those third parties if you so choose. Such access to your information would require\nyour explicit opt-in via a setting in your account.\n\n4.

In cases where we do this, any aggregated information shared in\nthese contexts is limited to Settings, Log Data, Interactive Information, or\ninformation derived from Cookies or Web Beacons. Such information will be\naggregated and will not contain your Personal Information.\n\n4.2 Third party services\n\nWe may employ third party companies and individuals to perform Site or App\nmaintenance, database management, analytics support, data processing or email and\ntext message distribution. These third parties have access to your information only\nto perform these tasks on our behalf.\n\n4.3 Mergers and acquisitions\n\nIf Alumnifire is acquired by or merged with another company or a similar corporate\ntransaction takes place, we may share information about you with the other company.\nIn such a case, we will notify you with a prominent notice on the Site or App or by\nsending notice to the email address listed in your account before transferring\nyour information.\n\n4.4 Legal investigations\n\nWe may share information about you to prevent or take action regarding illegal\nactivities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical\nsafety or other rights and interests of any person, violations of Alumnifire's\nTerms of Service, or as otherwise required by law or compulsory legal\nprocess.\n\n4.5 Compliance\n\nWe may share information about you for legal compliance in response to subpoenas,\nsearch warrants, judicial proceedings, court orders, legal process, or other law\nenforcement measures, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend\nagainst legal claims.\n\n5. Updating and deleting your information\n\nYou can modify or delete Personal Information in your profile by editing your\nprofile directly via the Site or App. You can also deactivate or delete your\nAlumnifire account entirely within your account settings. In either case, keep in\nmind that your Member Content will remain publicly viewable via the Site and\nApp.\n\n6. Security measures\n\nTo protect your privacy and information, Alumnifire uses multiple security\nprocedures and practices to protect the Personal Information of users. While we\nbelieve that we meet or exceed industry standards to protect your Personal\nInformation, no method of transferring such information over the internet or\nstoring it digitally is 100% secure, nor can we guarantee the absolute security of\nyour information. If you have any questions about security on our Service, email us.\n\n6.1 General security\n\nWhen you enter Personal Information on our Service, we encrypt that information\nusing secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is a web security standard that\ncreates a secure connection between our web servers and your browser and protects\nyour data from unauthorized access. Your Personal Information is password-protected\nand our main servers are locked and hosted by a leading provider. Access to the\nhost environment is secure.\n\n6.2 Phishing\n\nWe will never request your credit card or banking information, your Alumnifire\nAccount ID, login password, or any other private Personal Information in a non\nsecure or unsolicited email or phone call. If someone claiming to represent\nAlumnifire does ask for such information unsolicited, DO NOT provide it.\n\n6.3 Protect your information: keep communication within the platform\n\nCommunications and Exchanges should be performed exclusively using our Service.\nKeeping communication within the Service protects you and your information. Do not\nrequest personal email addresses, Skype usernames, phone numbers, or other personal\ncontact details from other users of the Service. Sharing personal information with\nand contacting other users outside of the Service may put you at risk.\n\n6.4 Disclosure of breaches\n\nWe will of course make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the\nsecurity, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored\n\"personal data\" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach\nnotification). These notices will be done via email or conspicuous posting on the\nSite or App as quickly as possible and without unreasonable delay, taking into\nconsideration the legitimate needs of law enforcement or any measures necessary to\ndetermine the scope of the breach and restore the integrity of the Service. In\nother words, if we need to stay quiet about a breach to help the good guys catch\nthe bad ones, we'll do that until the coast is clear.\n\n7. Jurisdictions and international transfer\n\nAlumnifire operates in the United States and processes information described in this\npolicy here in the U.S. Additionally, we work and share data as described in this\npolicy with third parties who may perform their activities in other countries. As a\nresult, your information as shared with Alumnifire and our partners may be subject\nto the laws of jurisdictions outside your own, and those laws may not afford the\nsame privacy and data protection laws as your home jurisdiction's, particularly\nregarding demands or requests for information from government entities. By using\nour Service, you agree that your information may be collected, transferred, stored,\nand processed in the United States and in other countries.\n\n8. Default information sharing\n\nWhen joining a community on Alumnifire, your account will be set to share your\nprofile information (including contact information like email address) with the\nmoderators of that community by default.
