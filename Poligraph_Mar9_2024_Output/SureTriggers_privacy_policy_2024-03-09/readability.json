This Statement also outlines your choices for accessing, deleting, and correcting your personal information. The term \u201cinformation\u201d in this Privacy Statement refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual.</p><p>This Privacy Statement applies to all SureTriggers Inc. websites\u2019 domains and subdomains, as well as any other website that links to this Statement. This Privacy Statement also applies to information collected through the services and developer programs offered by SureTriggers Inc., including our developer platform and services, communities, marketing and customer engagement, and branded social media pages.</p><p>Please note that this Privacy Statement does not cover information collected about our employees, as our employment policies apply to them.

This Privacy Statement also does not include any information that is not personally identifiable, such as anonymous or aggregate information.&nbsp;</p><p>It is our policy to periodically review and update our privacy practices and procedures to ensure the protection of our clients\u2019 personal information. Should any material changes be made to our privacy policy in the future, we will promptly notify you by prominently posting the revised policy on our Website. Your continued use of our Website and Service following the posting of any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy and its associated terms and conditions.</p><p>Our services are not intended for children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect information from individuals under this age.

This method of dispute resolution is more streamlined and cost-effective than a formal court proceeding.

Arbitration may limit discovery compared to a court proceeding, and any award made by the arbitrator may be subject to limited review by a court. This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not limited to, any claims arising from or related to any aspect of the terms of use, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory. By entering into the terms of use, both you and we agree to waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit. The venue for arbitration will be in Delaware, USA and conducted in the English language. The award of the arbitration shall be binding on both parties. We will defend any claims barred by this agreement by invoking this agreement in any legal proceedings.</p><p>SureTriggers Services allow individuals and organizations to integrate and automate actions between various third-party applications.
