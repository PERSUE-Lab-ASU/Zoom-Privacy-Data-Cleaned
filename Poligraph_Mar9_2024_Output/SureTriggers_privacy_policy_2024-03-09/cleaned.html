<p>This Privacy Statement explains how SureTriggers Inc. and any associated entities collect, use, process, and share your personal information. This Statement also outlines your choices for accessing, deleting, and correcting your personal information. The term “information” in this Privacy Statement refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual.</p>



<p>This Privacy Statement applies to all SureTriggers Inc. websites’ domains and subdomains, as well as any other website that links to this Statement. This Privacy Statement also applies to information collected through the services and developer programs offered by SureTriggers Inc., including our developer platform and services, communities, marketing and customer engagement, and branded social media pages.</p>



<p>Please note that this Privacy Statement does not cover information collected about our employees, as our employment policies apply to them. Additionally, this Privacy Statement does not apply to information collected by third parties, such as other websites, social media platforms, or third-party service providers that integrate with SureTriggers Services “Website”/ ”“Services” / “service”. This Privacy Statement also does not include any information that is not personally identifiable, such as anonymous or aggregate information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is our policy to periodically review and update our privacy practices and procedures to ensure the protection of our clients’ personal information. Should any material changes be made to our privacy policy in the future, we will promptly notify you by prominently posting the revised policy on our Website. Your continued use of our Website and Service following the posting of any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy and its associated terms and conditions.</p>



<p>Our services are not intended for children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect information from individuals under this age. If you are under the age of 16, you are not permitted to use our Services or provide us with your information through our website or otherwise.</p>



<p>This section outlines the provisions regarding a potential merger or acquisition of the company. In the event of a merger or acquisition, we retain the right to transfer all information, including any personally identifiable information stored by us, to the newly formed entity or company. The user will be notified via email of any changes to the Website’s policies and standing following such an event.</p>



<p>In the event that you are found to be in breach of our Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to immediately terminate or suspend your use of this Website or Services. It is of utmost importance that you respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. Any dispute arising from such breach shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware, USA.</p>



<p>In the event of a disagreement between you and us in connection with the use of our website or SureTriggers Services, we agree to resolve any disputes through binding arbitration. This method of dispute resolution is more streamlined and cost-effective than a formal court proceeding. An independent arbitrator, rather than a judge or jury, will be tasked with resolving the dispute. Arbitration may limit discovery compared to a court proceeding, and any award made by the arbitrator may be subject to limited review by a court. This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not limited to, any claims arising from or related to any aspect of the terms of use, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory. By entering into the terms of use, both you and we agree to waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit. The venue for arbitration will be in Delaware, USA and conducted in the English language. The award of the arbitration shall be binding on both parties. We will defend any claims barred by this agreement by invoking this agreement in any legal proceedings.</p>



<p><strong>SureTriggers Services</strong></p>

Information necessary for accessing the third-party applications and any data or content contained within the third-party application necessary for automation will be collected by SureTriggers. Data may also be shared between third-party applications and SureTriggers. Users or their designated account administrators have the ability to delete or export their account data. If you have any questions about deleting or exporting account data, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@suretriggers.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support@suretriggers.com.</a></p>



<p>It is important to note that use of SureTriggers Services is subject to the <a href="https://suretriggers.com/terms-and-conditions/">Terms of Service</a> and sensitive information, such as financial or regulated health information, should not be transmitted.

We may also use your email address to send additional messages such as newsletters, updates on our features, information about new services, events, and other relevant information.

<p>Upon termination or deactivation of your account, we may elect to retain your information for record-keeping purposes. However, we are not required to do so. In accordance with our Privacy Policy, we will not publicly disclose any personally identifiable information without your consent.</p>



<p>We reserve the right to remove any content or messages at our sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, if we determine that such action is necessary to comply with the law, legal process, or investigate suspected or actual illegal activities; to enforce our policies; to avoid liability; to defend against third-party claims; to support government enforcement agencies; or to protect the security, integrity, or safety of our Website, users, or others.</p>



<p>In order to integrate with third-party services, SureTriggers Services “Services”/ “Service” requires your authorization via authorization tokens to access the service’s Application Programming Interface (API). This is typically achieved through the use of the OAuth protocol, which enables our Services to connect and act as an intermediary and communicate with the third-party service on your behalf. In the event that the third-party service does not employ OAuth, API keys or login credentials may be used for authentication and authorization. In such cases, we take diligent measures to secure any API keys or login credentials that are provided to us and use them only for the intended purpose. Upon the removal of the connection for which you have provided the information, we shall promptly and automatically delete the said information from our database and server.</p>



<p>SureTriggers use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google API Services User Data Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Privacy Policy</a> including the Limited Use requirements.

Additionally, SureTriggers Services does not share any <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/terms/12n/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Restricted Platform Data</a> from Facebook with any third-party organizations or individuals.</p>

  Further information about retention time
</h3>

<p>Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.</p>

Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br><br>
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>

  <li><strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.</li>
  <li><strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other than storing it.
