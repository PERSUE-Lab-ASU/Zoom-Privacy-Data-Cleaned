<h2><strong>Effective Date; Changes.</strong> This Policy applies to all information collected by or provided to us in connection with the Services. When we make any material changes to this Policy, we will change the Effective Date above and upload a revised policy onto our website. We will treat your continued use of the Services following such notice as your acceptance of the changes.</h2>

<h2><strong>Collected Information.</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Account Data.</strong> When you log-in to or create an account with the Services, we collect the information you provide in the applicable form. This information includes personally identifiable information such as your name, email, phone number and password. When we refer to “personally identifiable information” in this Policy, we mean information that we can directly associate with a specific person or entity without additional information. To the extent you decline to share certain personally identifiable information with us, we may not be able to provide some or all of the features and functionalities found on the Services.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Information Collected Automatically.</strong> When you use the Services, we automatically gather certain non-personally identifiable information from you. This includes usage information, such as information on the beginning and ending timestamps of each communication session, how far Products were “driven” during each session, which remote users were involved in each session and the timestamps of when Products are turned on/off and docked/undocked. This also may include server log data such as the IP address, browser type, or device ID of your computer or mobile device, or (in the case of the Site) the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Site. As described below, we collect this information through a number of means, including server logs, cookies and other online tracking mechanisms. We may use this information to improve quality, features and performance. We may provide this information back to users in the form of reports and statistics. We may associate such non-personally identifiable information with the personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with the Services. But if we do so, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Online Tracking and Cookies.</strong> The Services may use web beacons, cookies and other online tracking mechanisms to collect information. “Beacons” (also often referred to as “pixels”) are tiny graphics on a web page designed to track when a page is viewed. Beacons also can be inserted into emails in order to track certain information, including whether an email has been opened. “Cookies” are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters that are downloaded by your web browser or mobile device when you visit a website. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies when you access and use the Services. Cookies may be used, for example, to remember your user account information and your preferences, to customize the interface of the Services for you and to assist us in measuring and analyzing Services traffic. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Services. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your browser’s documentation to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings. You can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your computer’s hard drive and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored. We partner with certain third parties to collect non-personally identifiable information. These third parties may use web logs, web beacons or other online tracking mechanisms, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. Means of opting out of this third-party data collection are discussed below in Section 2(4).</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Analytics.</strong> We use certain third party services to assist us in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting regarding the Services. These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, we use Google Analytics to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed in this Policy. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics on the Site at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Transactions.</strong> Certain features of the Services require payments to the Company. If you participate in such a transaction, such third party payment processor the Company may utilize from time to time will receive your payment information for purposes of processing such transaction and we will receive such payment. The Company does not receive your credit card information.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests.</strong> The Company may conduct user surveys from time to time to collect information about your preferences. These surveys are optional. If you choose to respond, your responses may be kept anonymous. Similarly, we may offer contests to qualifying users in which we ask for contact and demographic information such as name, email address and mailing address. Information we gather through a contest may also be disclosed to third parties only as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of such contest or similar offering.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Marketing and Customer Service Data.</strong> The Company may collect information about you if you ask to receive information about us or our Services or sign up for our newsletter or when you contact us directly (i.e. telephone call, email or through our Services). This may include company and/or personal names, phone numbers, email addresses, your location, billing information, information about how you use our Services and other information required to provide a service or information you have requested from us.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Visitor or Employee Data.</strong> Visitor and Employee Data may include visitors’ and employees’ names, phone numbers, email addresses, locations and photographs, times of visits, visitors’ employers’ names, any executed visitor agreement and any other information that we capture about our visitors and employees.

<h2>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects personal information in students’ “educational records” from unauthorized disclosure unless an exception applies.</h2>
<h2>FERPA may require educational institutions and school districts (“Education Providers”) to obtain parental consent before disclosing Student Data outside of the educational institution. Student Data is information maintained by us or any third party on our behalf relating to an individual person enrolled at an Education Provider (“Student”), including any education records as defined under FERPA, that are disclosed by Education Providers to Company, except that Student Data does not include a record that has had personal data removed such that the Student’s identity is not uniquely identifiable from the record and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the remaining information can be used to identify an individual.</h2>
