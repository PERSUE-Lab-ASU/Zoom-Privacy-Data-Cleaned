This\nInformation is different from \"Individual-level\" information and is not Personal\nInformation because it does not identify any particular individual or disclose any\nparticular individual\u2019s data. For example, Aggregate Information may include a\nstatement that \"30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait,\" without\nproviding any data or testing results specific to any individual user. In contrast,\nIndividual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information consists of data\nabout a single individual's genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics\ninformation and could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or\nconsist of all of the Genetic Information about that user.

For example, we may be required to disclose Personal\nInformation in coordination with regulatory authorities in response to lawful requests\nby public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement\nrequirements. MIMI-RX Registry will preserve and disclose any and all information\nto law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good\nfaith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a)\ncomply with legal or regulatory process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order,\nor government inquiry) or obligations that MIMI-RX Registry may owe pursuant to\nethical and other professional rules, laws, and regulations; (b) enforce the MIMI-RX\nRegistry Terms of Service and other policies; (c) respond to claims that any content\nviolates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal\nsafety of MIMI-RX Registry, its employees, its users, its clients, and the public.

This\nInformation is different from \"Individual-level\" information and is not Personal\nInformation because it does not identify any particular individual or disclose any\nparticular individual\u2019s data. For example, Aggregate Information may include a\nstatement that \"30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait,\" without\nproviding any data or testing results specific to any individual user. In contrast,\nIndividual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information consists of data\nabout a single individual's genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics\ninformation and could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or\nconsist of all of the Genetic Information about that user.
