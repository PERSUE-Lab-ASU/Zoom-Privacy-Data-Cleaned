A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. (For the purposes of this Policy, we shall define “browser storage” to be equivalent to a “cookie.”) We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site; these cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Service and remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. We also use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Service; these cookies disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to use significant portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.</li><li _ngcontent-sc99="">Third-party websites may also place or read cookies on your computer’s browser — please see below the section “Third-Party Sites.”</li></ul><h3 _ngcontent-sc99="">2) Links to other websites may track clicks</h3><p _ngcontent-sc99="">We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed.</p><h3 _ngcontent-sc99="">3) Third-party sites we link to or partner with may have their own policies.</h3><p _ngcontent-sc99="">This Policy applies only to the Site and the Service.
