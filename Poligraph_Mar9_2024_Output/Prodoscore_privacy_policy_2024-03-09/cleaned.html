<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>

						  <h2>10. International Transfers of Data</h2>
<p>Any data that you provide to us may be accessed, shared or processed by our offices, located in the United States, and service providers located in the United States, if such data transfer is necessary for the specific purpose for which you submitted your data (such as the provision of goods or services under a written contract).</p>
<p>This may entail a transfer of your personal information across international borders. The data protections standards may differ and be lower than the standards enforced in your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We maintain appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law for any personal information transferred internationally, and as required by applicable law, will seek your consent prior to such transfers.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Shield.</strong>&nbsp;Prodoscore complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries, United Kingdom and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Prodoscore has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit&nbsp;<a title="Opens in a new window" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.privacyshield.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1593810474982000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEccGIDdQqMcS6Y34Jjs6K5Pz0w-A">privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Prodoscore is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>Prodoscore will cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.</p>
<p>As explained in this Privacy Policy, we sometimes provide your information to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer personal information received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, the third party’s access, use, and disclosure of the personal data must also be in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and we will remain liable under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. We may be required to disclose personal information that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Prodoscore commits&nbsp;to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact&nbsp;us at the contact information below.</p>
<p>Prodoscore has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the JAMS Privacy Shield Dispute Resolution. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit&nbsp;<a title="Opens in a new window" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Shield Claim</a>&nbsp;for more information and to file a complaint.

<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. For example, when possible, we use encryption to transfer and store data. We further limit access to this data using access controls and confidentiality commitments.</p>
<p>However, no website, application, or transmission can guarantee security. Thus, while we have established and maintain what we believe to be reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information obtained through the Sites, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
