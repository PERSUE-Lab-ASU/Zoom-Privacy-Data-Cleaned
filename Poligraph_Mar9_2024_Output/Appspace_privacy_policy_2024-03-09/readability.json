Appspace describes the practices under which we collect information below and provides further processes to exercise any California Privacy Rights under the <span>\u201cYour California Privacy Rights\u201d section</span>.</em></p><h3><span><strong>What personally identifiable information do we collect, and when do we collect it?</strong></span></h3><h4><span><strong>General access to Appspace Sites</strong></span></h4><p>We collect personal information from you when you register for an Appspace product through one or more Appspace Sites and create an account. However, as a visitor to Appspace Sites, you may choose to apply for a job with us, engage in correspondence with us regarding any questions you may have, or express an interest in receiving additional information from us about Appspace and our offerings. In such situations, we may ask you to voluntarily provide personal information \u2013 such as your name, contact details, or company name.</p><h4><span><strong>Registration</strong></span></h4><p>In order to access basic services on Appspace Sites, including but not limited to, the Knowledge Center (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d), you must become a user by registering at no charge. You can also select a paid subscription, which offers enhanced Services and support. When you register, we ask for your first and last name, email address, company/group, country (time zone), and to enter a password of your choice (please note passwords must meet applicable industry integrity best practices and must meet Appspace requirements). Once you are a registered user, a new account is provisioned in one or more Appspace Sites and Salesforce (\u201cCRM\u201d), which adds to our records the following information: subscription level, registration date, and renewal date (which is twelve months from the registration date).</p><h4><span><strong>IP Address</strong></span></h4><p>When you visit Appspace Sites, we keep track of your Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address. An IP address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information.</p><h4><span><strong>Cookies</strong></span></h4><p>A \u201ccookie\u201d is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. To better understand how Appspace Sites are used and to improve the content of Appspace Sites, we may set a cookie on your computer. Cookies do not identify you personally.

We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services in order to customize and improve our Services.

This usually means for as long as you have an active account with us and for six months after the deactivation or deletion of such account. Mandatory legislation, such as bookkeeping, account keeping, or tax legislation, may require us to store some of your personally identifiable information for longer periods.</p><p><span>Personally identifiable information processed based on your consent will be deleted in the event of your withdrawal of your consent.</span></p><h4><span><u><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></u></span></h4><p><span>California law (under the California Consumer Privacy Act and as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act) permits Appspace customers who are California residents to request certain information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. This request is free and may be made once a year. To make such a request, please email us at the following address: </span><a href=\"mailto:legal@appspace.com\"><span>privacy@appspace.com</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>If you are a California resident, California law provides you with the following additional rights with respect to your personal information:</span></p><ul><li><span>The right to know what personal information we collect, use, and disclose about you.

You also may designate an authorized agent to make a request for access on your behalf.</span></li><li><span>The right to request that Appspace delete any personal information Appspace has collected about you.

By providing us with your information, you are accepting and agreeing to that transfer. In the event your information is transferred abroad, Appspace complies with the applicable laws and requirements in the respective jurisdiction as it pertains to our obligations.</p><h4><span><strong>What about children\u2019s personally identifiable information?</strong></span></h4><p>None of the Appspace Sites are directed to children under the age of 13. We assume that products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults or minors supervised by a parent or guardian. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are committed to complying with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d). Furthermore, we discourage children under the age of 13 from accessing or using Appspace Sites. In order to leverage the toolset and publish applications, you have to purchase a subscription from us and our policy is that we sell these licenses only to companies.</p><p>If a parent believes that his or her child has provided us with personal information, he or she can contact us via e-mail at<br><a href=\"mailto:legal@appspace.com\">privacy@appspace.com</a> or via web/contact form located at <a href=\"https://www.appspace.com/contact/\">https://www.appspace.com/contact/</a>. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13.</p><p>We believe that parents should supervise their children\u2019s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.</p><h3><span><strong>What else should you know about your privacy?</strong></span></h3><h4><span><strong>Security</strong></span></h4><p>We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. These security measures include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and encryption of all password information. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure.</p><h4><span><strong>Employee Access</strong></span></h4><p>Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.</p><h4><span><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></span></h4><p><span>Appspace Sites may contain hyperlinks and pointers to Internet sites maintained by third parties. These links are provided for your reference only. We do not control, operate or endorse in any respect information, products or services on such third-party sites and are not responsible for their content. Many third-party sites have their own privacy policies that differ from ours. This Privacy Policy only covers Appspace Sites and does not cover any other site. While we make every effort to keep your information secure, we do not control the policies of other sites.</span></p><h4><span><strong>Complaints</strong></span></h4><p>If you believe that our processing of your personally identifiable information does not correspond to what we have described in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise breach applicable personal data legislation, you are welcome to contact us at the e-mail address provided below. If you reside in a country or are a citizen of a country that is a part of the European Union or European Economic Area, you may, as an alternative, complain to the Data Protection Authority in your country.</p><h4><span><strong>Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure</strong></span></h4><p><span>Appspace takes a proactive approach in the protection of our systems and our customers\u2019 information. Our security efforts include a Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure program (\u201cRVD\u201d). The intent of Appspace\u2019s RVD is to help minimize the impact of security flaws identified by \u201cIndependent Security Researchers\u201d in our systems. We appreciate the role these Independent Security Researchers play in our efforts to keep the systems secure and protected. As part of our program, we encourage Independent Security Researchers to contact us at </span><a href=\"mailto:security@appspace.com\"><span>security@appspace.com</span></a><span> with any potential security vulnerabilities. Please note Appspace does not currently operate a Public Bug Program and makes no offer of reward or compensation in exchange for a potential security vulnerability identified.</span></p><h4><span><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></span></h4><p>Any information that we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
