<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Punchpass privacy policy</h1>



<p><em>Privacy policy updated May 15, 2018</em></p>



<p>Thanks for using Punchpass or visiting one of our websites.&nbsp;<strong>We take your privacy extremely seriously, and we never sell lists, email addresses, or any customer/client data.</strong>&nbsp;This policy explains the what, how, and why of the information we collect when you visit one of our websites, or when you use our Services. It also explains the specific ways we use and disclose that information.</p>



<p>THE BASICS</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Definitions</h4>



<p>These definitions should help you understand this policy. When we say “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Punchpass,” we are referring to Trillo, Inc. d/b/a Punchpass, a State of Vermont S Corporation. We provide online platforms that you may use to market to, sell to, keep track of data related to, or stay in contact with others, related to your customers (the “Services”). When we say “client,” we are referring to the person or entity that is registered with us to use the Services. When we say “you,” we are referring either to a client or to some other person who visits any of our Websites. A “customer” is a person you contact through our Services, or a person who you might choose to contact at some point in the future through the use of our Services. In other words, a customer is anyone on your customer list or about whom you have given us information. “Personal Information” means any information that identifies or can be used to identify you or a customer, directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, email address, gender, occupation or other demographic information. A “customer list” is a list of customers and all associated information related to those customers (for example, email addresses).</p>



<p>We offer the Services on our websites&nbsp;<a href="https://punchpass.com/">https://punchpass.com/</a>&nbsp;and , as well as embedded on our clients websites. This Privacy Policy applies to any website powered by Punchpass. While providing the Services, and as described in more detail below, we may collect Personal Information about a Website visitor, client, person or email address on or related to a customer list, or customer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Changes</h4>



<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy is reflected by the version date located at the top of this Privacy Policy. All updates and amendments are effective immediately. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy often to stay informed of changes that may affect you, as your continued use of the Website signifies your continuing consent to be bound by this Privacy Policy. Our electronically or otherwise properly stored copies of this Privacy Policy are each deemed to be the true, complete, valid, authentic, and enforceable copy of the version of this Privacy Policy which were in effect on each respective date you visited the Website.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Scope</h4>



<p>This Privacy Policy is effective with respect to any data that we have collected, or collect, about and/or from you, according to our Terms of Use.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Questions &amp; Concerns</h4>



<p>If you have any questions or comments, or if you want to update, delete, or change any Personal Information we hold, or you have a concern about the way in which we have handled any privacy matter, please contact us by email at&nbsp;<strong>privacy@punchpass.com</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">YOUR INFORMATION</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Information We Collect</h4>



<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Information you voluntarily provide to us:</strong>&nbsp;When you sign up for and use the Services, consult with our customer service team, send us an email, send us an online message, integrate the Services with another website or service (for example, when you choose to connect your Stripe account with Punchpass), or communicate with us in any way, you are voluntarily giving us information that we collect. That information may include either your or your customers’ name, physical address, email address, IP address, phone number, as well as details including gender, occupation, location, purchase history, and other demographic information. In connection with using the Services, you may generate content that provides us with additional information about you. You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys or communicate with us about a support question. By the very nature of using our Services, you will also enter information about your business and your customers. By giving us this information, you consent to this information being collected, used, disclosed, transferred to the United States and stored by us, as described in our Terms of Use and in this Privacy Policy.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Information we collect automatically:</strong>&nbsp;When you use the Services or browse one of our Websites, we may collect information about your visit to our Websites, your usage of the Services, and your web browsing activity. Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, browsing activity, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We may collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies. We collect log information when you use our Services solely for the purposes of making our Services better and troubleshooting problems.</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>Email information:</strong>&nbsp;When you send an email with the Services, we have and may access the data about and the information in your email.</p>



<p>(d)&nbsp;<strong>Information from your use of the Service:</strong>&nbsp;We may receive information about how and when you use the Services, store it in log files or other types of files associated with your account, and link it to other information we collect about you. This information may include, for example, your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions you have taken within the application. This type of information helps us to improve our Services for both you and for all of our users.</p>



<p>(e)&nbsp;<strong>Cookies and tracking:</strong>&nbsp;We and our partners may use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, and this may include using cookies and similar tracking technologies on our Website, such as pixels and web beacons, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, serve targeted advertisements, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. We may partner with third parties to manage and serve our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use cookies or similar tracking technologies in order to provide you advertising or other content based upon your browsing activities and interests.</p>



<p>(f)&nbsp;<strong>Web beacons:</strong>&nbsp;We use Web Beacons (which are small blocks of code; also called pixel tags) on our Websites and in our emails. When we send emails to clients, we may track behavior such as who opened the emails and who clicked the links. This allows us to measure the performance of email campaigns and to improve our features for specific segments of clients. To do this, we include single pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to understand what actions your customers took. Reports are also available to us when we send email to you, so we may collect and review that information.</p>



<p>(g)&nbsp;<strong>Information from other sources:</strong>&nbsp;From time to time we may obtain information about you or your customers from third party sources, such as public databases, social media platforms, third party data providers and our joint marketing partners. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available. We may also get information from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (…but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes. We take steps to ensure that such third parties are legally permitted or required to disclose such information to us. Examples of the information we may receive from other sources include: demographic information, device information (such as IP addresses), location, and online behavioral data (such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links). We use this information, alone or in combination with other information (including Personal Information) we collect, to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing and content to you and to develop and provide you with more relevant products features, and services.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>



<p>We may use and disclose Personal Information only for the following purposes:</p>

If you use any of our Services and we think you might benefit from using another Service we offer, we may send you an email about that.

These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Website, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. We also maintain presences on social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Any information, communications, or materials you submit to us via a social media platform is done at your own risk without any expectation of privacy. We cannot control the actions of other users of these platforms or the actions of the platforms themselves. Your interactions with those features and platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p>



<p>(b) Links to third-party websites. Our Websites include links to other websites, whose privacy practices may be different from ours. If you submit Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Third Parties</h4>



<p>We may disclose Personal Information to the following types of third parties for the purposes described in this policy:</p>



<p>(a) Service Providers. Sometimes, we share your information with our third party Service Providers, who help us provide and support our Services. For example, if it is necessary to provide you something you have requested (like enable sales via Stripe), then we may share your and/or your customers’ Personal Information with a Service Provider for that purpose. Just like with the other third parties we work with, these third party Service Providers enter into a contract that requires them to use your Personal Information only for the provision of services to us and in a manner that is consistent with this policy. Examples of Service Providers include hosting services and content delivery services, and payment processors.</p>



<p>(b) Advertising partners. We may partner with third party advertising networks to manage and serve our advertising on other sites and may share Personal Information with them for this purpose. All third parties with which we share this information are required to use your Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. We and our third party partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as pixels and web beacons, to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to provide you with targeted advertising based on your browsing activities and interests.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">10. Contest and Sweepstakes</h4>



<p>We may, from time to time, offer surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions on our Websites or through social media (collectively “Our Promotions”). Participation in our Promotions is completely voluntary. Information requested for entry may include personal contact information such as your name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address, username, and similar details. We use the information you provide to administer Our Promotions. We may also, unless prohibited by the Promotion’s rules or law, use the information provided to communicate with you, or other people you select, about our Services. We may share this information with our affiliates and other organizations or Service Providers in line with this policy and the rules posted for the Promotion.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">11. Content of Email Deliveries</h4>



<p>When you send an email using our service, it bounces from server to server as it crosses the Internet. Along the way, server administrators can read what you send. Email was not built for confidential information. Please do not use Punchpass to send confidential information.</p>



<p>We may review the content of our clients’ email deliveries to make sure they comply with our Terms of Use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">YOUR LISTS &amp; Customer Information</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12. Your customer lists</h4>



<p>Your customer lists are stored on a secure Punchpass server.&nbsp;<strong>We do not, under any circumstances, sell your customer lists.</strong>&nbsp;If someone on your customer list complains or contacts us, we might then contact that person. We will alert you if we have any communication with any of your customers explaining why. Only authorized employees have access to view customer lists. You may export (download) your customer lists from Punchpass at any time.</p>



<p>We will use and disclose the information in your customer lists only for the reasons discussed in Sections 6-9. Punchpass will never market directly to your customers, or use any of the customer information you have uploaded, for marketing purposes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">SECURITY</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">13. Notice of Breach of Security</h4>



<p>If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that materially affects you or people on your customer lists, then Punchpass will notify you as soon as possible and later report the action we took in response.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">14. Safeguarding Your Information</h4>



<p>We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.</p>



<p>Our credit card processing vendor, Stripe, uses security measures to protect your information both during the transaction and after it is complete. Stripe.com is a PCI compliant payment processor. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us at&nbsp;<strong>privacy@punchpass.com</strong>.</p>



<p>Punchpass accounts and customer logins require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Because the information in your customer lists is so sensitive, account passwords are encrypted, which means we cannot see your passwords. We cannot resend forgotten passwords, and can only provide you a link you can use to initiate the reset process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">COMPLIANCE</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">15. We Operate in the United States</h4>



<p>Our servers and offices are located in the United States, so your information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States. While the data protection, privacy, and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take many steps to protect your privacy, including offering a data processing addendum. By using our Websites, you understand and consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information to our facilities in the United States and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this policy. Punchpass is exploring becoming Privacy Shield certified in order to certify our compliance with data transfer to the United States.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">16. Accuracy and Retention of Data</h4>



<p>We do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do so. If your data changes (for example, if you have a new email address), then you are responsible for notifying us of those changes. Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you with our Services. We may also retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our Agreements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">17. Access</h4>



<p>We will give an individual, either you or a customer, access to any Personal Information we hold about them within 30 days of any request for that information. Individuals may request to access, correct, amend or delete information we hold about them by contacting us at&nbsp;<strong>privacy@punchpass.com</strong>. Unless it is prohibited by law, we will remove any Personal Information about an individual, either you or a customer, from our servers at your or their request. Please note we will need to confirm your identity in order to access, update, or remove any information. There is no charge for an individual to access or update their Personal Information.</p>
