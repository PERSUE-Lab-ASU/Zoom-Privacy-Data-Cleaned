Just like with the other third parties we work with, these third party Service Providers enter into a contract that requires them to use your Personal Information only for the provision of services to us and in a manner that is consistent with this policy. Examples of Service Providers include hosting services and content delivery services, and payment processors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(b) Advertising partners. We may partner with third party advertising networks to manage and serve our advertising on other sites and may share Personal Information with them for this purpose.

Your customer lists</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your customer lists are stored on a secure Punchpass server.&nbsp;<strong>We do not, under any circumstances, sell your customer lists.</strong>&nbsp;If someone on your customer list complains or contacts us, we might then contact that person. We will alert you if we have any communication with any of your customers explaining why. Only authorized employees have access to view customer lists. You may export (download) your customer lists from Punchpass at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will use and disclose the information in your customer lists only for the reasons discussed in Sections 6-9.

Safeguarding Your Information</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our credit card processing vendor, Stripe, uses security measures to protect your information both during the transaction and after it is complete. Stripe.com is a PCI compliant payment processor. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us at&nbsp;<strong>privacy@punchpass.com</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Punchpass accounts and customer logins require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Because the information in your customer lists is so sensitive, account passwords are encrypted, which means we cannot see your passwords. We cannot resend forgotten passwords, and can only provide you a link you can use to initiate the reset process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>COMPLIANCE</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>15. We Operate in the United States</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Our servers and offices are located in the United States, so your information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States.

Accuracy and Retention of Data</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do so. If your data changes (for example, if you have a new email address), then you are responsible for notifying us of those changes. Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you with our Services. We may also retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our Agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>17.
