<p>You are entitled by law to access, correct, amend, or delete personal information about you that we hold.&nbsp; A summary listing these rights appears below.&nbsp; Please note that these rights are not absolute and certain exemptions may apply to specific requests that you may submit to us.</p>



<p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information below in the“<strong>Contact Us</strong>” section or view our “Make a Data Privacy Request” page.&nbsp; For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before responding to your request.&nbsp; In the event that we refuse a request, we will provide you a reason as to why.</p>



<p><strong><em>Asking us to access your personal information</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>



<p>You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not we are processing personal information about you, and if so, the right to be provided with the information contained in this Policy.&nbsp; You also have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information.&nbsp; When making a request, please provide an accurate description of the personal information to which you want access. Where requests are repetitive or manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative cost.</p>



<p><strong><em>Asking us to rectify your personal information</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>



<p>You have the right to ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate.&nbsp; You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.</p>



<p><strong><em>Asking us to delete your personal information</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>



<p>You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information if:</p>



<ul>
<li>We no longer need it for the purposes for which we collected it;</li>



<li>We have been using it with no valid legal basis;</li>



<li>We are obligated to erase it to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject;</li>



<li>We need your consent to use the information and you withdraw consent; or</li>



<li>You object to us processing your personal information where our legal basis for doing so is our legitimate interests and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, this right is not absolute.&nbsp; Even if you make a request for deletion, we may need to retain certain information for legal or administrative purposes, such as record keeping, maintenance of opt-out requirements, defending or making legal claims, or detecting fraudulent activities.&nbsp; We will retain information in accordance with the “<strong>How Long Is Your Personal Information Kept</strong>” section below.</p>



<p>If you do exercise a valid right to have your personal information deleted, please keep in mind that deletion by third parties to whom the information has been provided might not be immediate and that the deleted information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period (but will not be available to others).</p>



<p><strong><em>Asking us to restrict our use of your personal information</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>



<p>You have the right to ask us to place a restriction on our use of your personal information if one of the following applies to you:</p>



<ul>
<li>You contest the accuracy of the information that we hold about you, while we verify its accuracy;</li>



<li>We have used your information unlawfully, but you request us to restrict its use instead of erasing it;</li>



<li>We no longer need the information for the purpose for which we collected it, but you need it to deal with a legal claim; or</li>



<li>You have objected to us using your information, while we check whether our legitimate grounds override your right to object.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>The right to transfer your personal information to another service provider</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>



<p>You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information you gave us from one organization to another, or give it to you (<em>i.e.</em> data portability).&nbsp; This applies to personal information we are processing to service a contract with you and to personal information we are processing based on your consent.</p>



<p><strong><em>The right to withdraw consent</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>If we obtain your written consent to collect and process your personal information, you can subsequently withdraw such consent as to any further processing of such information.</p>



<p><strong><em>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>If you believe your rights under the GDPR have been violated, the GDPR gives you the right to file a complaint with your supervisory authority. A list of supervisory authorities is available here:&nbsp; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080">EEA and EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs)</a>; <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/task.html">Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC)</span>; <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/">UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</a>.</p>



<p><strong><em>Rights related to automated decision-making</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>



<p>To the extent that we engage in decision-making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or which significantly affects you, you have the right not to be subject to such decision-making.</p>



<p><strong><em>Right to object to processing</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>



<p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information that is based on legitimate interests or your consent (rather than when the reason for using it is to perform an obligation due to you under a contract with us).&nbsp; If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we can demonstrate the processing is for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.&nbsp; You can object to the processing of your personal information by contacting us using the information in the “<strong>Contact Us</strong>” section below.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information </em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Consent</em></strong><em>.</em>&nbsp; We may process your personal information based on your consent such as when you purchase a service or ask us to send you certain kinds of marketing communications.&nbsp; You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
<ul>
<li><em>Children’s Consent. </em>We do not knowingly process data of EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland residents under the age of 16 without reasonably verified parental consent.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong><em>Our Legitimate Interests.&nbsp; </em></strong>We may process your personal information if doing so is necessary for our legitimate interests relating to our business purposes arising from your relationship with us, and your rights as an individual do not override those legitimate interests.&nbsp; For example, our legitimate interests include but are not limited to when we process your personal information to carry out fraud prevention activities and activities to increase network and information security, identify usage trends, determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, expand our business activities and improve our services and the content and functionality of our Services.<em>&nbsp; </em>Our legitimate interests also include providing you with the products and services you request, view, engage with, or purchase and communicating with you regarding your account or transactions with us.</li>

<p><strong><em>Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Information</em></strong></p>



<p>Our Services are operated in the United States.&nbsp; Personal information about you provide while in the EU, an EEA member state, the UK, or Switzerland may be transferred to the United States.&nbsp; The United States does not have an adequacy decision or adequacy regulation.&nbsp; The GDPR permits such transfers when necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us, if we obtain your explicit consent to such transfer, or if it is in our legitimate interest to transfer the personal information.&nbsp; The laws in the United States may not be as protective as the GDPR or the laws of other jurisdictions where you may be located.&nbsp; If we transfer personal information from the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland, or another country with cross-border transfer obligations, we will provide an appropriate safeguard, such as using standard contractual clauses.</p>



<p>To obtain a copy of the safeguard(s), please contact us using the information provided in the“<strong>Contact Us</strong>” section below.</p>
