In any case, we will\n            be\n            happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the\n            provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to\n            enter\n            into a contract.\n        Payment processing\n        In case of Services requiring payment, you may need to provide your credit card details or other payment\n            account\n            information, which will be used solely for processing payments. We use third-party payment processors\n            (\u201cPayment Processors\u201d) to assist us in processing your payment information securely.\n        Payment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council,\n            which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Sensitive and\n            private\n            data exchange happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital\n            signatures, and the Website and Services are also in compliance with strict vulnerability standards in order\n            to\n            create as secure of an environment as possible for Users. We will share payment data with the Payment\n            Processors\n            only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing your payments, refunding such payments, and\n            dealing\n            with complaints and queries related to such payments and refunds.\n         Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal Information from you, which allows them to\n            process your payments (e.g., your email address, address, credit card details, and bank account number) and\n            handle all the steps in the payment process through their systems, including data collection and data\n            processing. The Payment Processors\u2019 use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective\n            privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest\n            that\n            you review their respective privacy policies.\n        Managing information\n        You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can\n            delete\n            may change as the Website and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may\n            maintain a\n            copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our\n            obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.\n        Disclosure of information\n         Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you\n            have\n            requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers\n            (collectively, \u201cService Providers\u201d) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and\n            Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our\n            policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any personally identifiable information\n            with\n            third parties and will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.\n        Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform\n            services\n            on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they need only\n            in\n            order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the\n            provided\n            information for their own marketing or other purposes.\n        Retention of information\n        We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary as long as your user account\n            remains\n            active, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or\n            permitted by law.\n        We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or\n            delete\n            it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal\n            Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to\n            rectification,\n            and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.\n        Transfer of information\n        Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country\n            other than your own. However, this will not include countries outside the European Union and European\n            Economic\n            Area. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this\n            Policy\n            or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.\n        \n        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), you have certain data protection\n            rights\n            and we aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your\n            Personal\n            Information. If you wish to be informed what Personal Information we hold about you and if you want it to be\n            removed from our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances, you have the following data\n            protection\n            rights:\n        \n            (i) You have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of\n            your Personal Information. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your Personal\n            Information is\n            consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness\n            of\n            processing before the withdrawal.\n        (ii) You have the right to learn if your Personal Information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure\n            regarding certain aspects of the processing, and obtain a copy of your Personal Information undergoing\n            processing.\n        (iii) You have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or\n            corrected.\n            You also have the right to request us to complete the Personal Information you believe is incomplete.\n        (iv) You have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a\n            legal basis other than consent. Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the\n            exercise\n            of an official authority vested in us, or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you\n            may\n            object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the\n            objection.\n        \n        (v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your Personal Information.\n            These circumstances include: the accuracy of your Personal Information is contested by you and we must\n            verify\n            its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of your Personal Information and\n            request\n            the restriction of its use instead; we no longer need your Personal Information for the purposes of\n            processing,\n            but you require it to establish, exercise or defend your legal claims; you have objected to processing\n            pending\n            the verification of whether our legitimate grounds override your legitimate grounds. Where processing has\n            been\n            restricted, such Personal Information will be marked accordingly and, with the exception of storage, will be\n            processed only with your consent or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal claims, for the\n            protection of the rights of another natural, or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.\n        \n        (vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from\n            us.\n            These circumstances include: the Personal Information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for\n            which it was collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object\n            to\n            the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing\n            purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right\n            to\n            erasure such as where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and\n            information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of\n            legal\n            claims.\n        (vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Information that you have provided to us in a structured,\n            commonly used, and machine-readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another\n            controller without any hindrance from us, provided that such transmission does not adversely affect the\n            rights\n            and freedoms of others.\n        (viii) You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your\n            Personal Information. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint directly with us, you have\n            the\n            right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. For more information, please contact\n            your\n            local data protection authority in the EEA. This provision is applicable provided that your Personal\n            Information\n            is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you\n            are\n            part of, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.\n        How to exercise your rights\n        Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to us through the contact details provided in this\n            document.\n            Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests. Your request\n            must\n            provide sufficient information that allows us to verify that you are the person you are claiming to be or\n            that\n            you are the authorized representative of such person. If we receive your request from an authorized\n            representative, we may request evidence that you have provided such an authorized representative with power\n            of\n            attorney or that the authorized representative otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests on\n            your\n            behalf.\n        You must include sufficient details to allow us to properly understand the request and respond to it. We\n            cannot\n            respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information unless we first verify your identity or\n            authority to make such a request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you.\n        Data analytics\n        Our Website and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar\n            information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage information. The\n            information\n            gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User activity such as how often Users visit our Website\n            and\n            Services, what pages they visit and for how long, etc. We use the information obtained from these analytics\n            tools to monitor the performance and improve our Website and Services. We do not use third-party analytics\n            tools\n            to track or to collect any personally identifiable information of our Users and we will not associate any\n            information gathered from the statistical reports with any individual User.\n        Do Not Track signals\n        Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to\n            have\n            your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with\n            a\n            website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from\n            consumers\n            who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers\n            communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet\n            set up\n            to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more\n            detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information. For a\n            description\n            of Do Not Track protocols for browsers and mobile devices or to learn more about the choices available to\n            you,\n            visit internetcookies.com\n        \n        Our Website and Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons, Share\n            This\n            buttons, etc (collectively, \u201cSocial Media Features\u201d).
