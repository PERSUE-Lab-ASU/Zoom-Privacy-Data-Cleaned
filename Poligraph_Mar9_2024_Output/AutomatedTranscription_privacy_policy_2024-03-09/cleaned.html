Generally, we may process your Personal Data to perform a contract with you or for your benefit, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or proceedings and to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, for our legitimate interests or, in limited circumstances, when we have your consent.</p><p>We may use your Personal Data as follows:</p><ul><li><p>If you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.</p></li><li><p>If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.

In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated in the “Contact Us” section below.</p></li><li><p>To enable us to carry out our obligations arising from our engagement with you or to take steps to enter into an agreement with you.</p></li><li><p>To protect the security of and managing access to our premises, IT and communication systems, online platforms, website and other systems, preventing and detecting security threats, fraud or other criminal or malicious activities.</p></li><li><p>To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations and requests, including reporting to and/or being audited or investigated by national and international regulatory bodies.</p></li><li><p>To comply with court orders and to exercise and/or defend our legal rights.</p></li></ul><p>If Sonix intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p></li><li class="px-3"><h3>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3><p>Sonix is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Business Transfers: </strong>As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. </p></li><li><p><strong>Related Companies: </strong>We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. </p></li><li><p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: </strong>Sonix, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting and cloud computing services,  and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. </p></li><li><p><strong>Legal Requirements: </strong>Sonix may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Sonix, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. </p></li></ul></li><li class="px-3"><h3>Data Transfers</h3><p>The Personal Data that we collect from you will be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom. Refer to Standard Contractual Clauses regarding EU data protection.</p></li><li class="px-3"><h3>Data Retention</h3><p>How long we retain your Personal Data depends on the type of data and the purpose for which we process the data.

If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Sonix through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p></li><li class="px-3"><h3>Links to other Web Sites</h3><p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Sonix (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Sonix endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p></li><li class="px-3"><h3>Security</h3><p>Sonix takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure.

Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Sonix via the Internet.</p></li><li class="px-3"><h3>Other Terms and Conditions</h3><p>Your access to and use of the Services is subject to the Terms of Service at <a href="https://sonix.ai/terms">www.sonix.ai/terms</a></p></li><li class="px-3"><h3>Changes to Sonix’s Privacy Policy</h3><p>The Services and our business may change from time to time.

If you exercise your rights, we will respect your decision in accordance with our legal obligations. </p><p><strong>Right to data portability: </strong>You have the right to receive Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and (if certain conditions are satisfied), transmit that Personal Data to a third party, if we have the technical means. </p><p><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority: </strong>If you have a concern about our privacy practices, including the way we handled your Personal Data, you can report it to your local data protection authority.
