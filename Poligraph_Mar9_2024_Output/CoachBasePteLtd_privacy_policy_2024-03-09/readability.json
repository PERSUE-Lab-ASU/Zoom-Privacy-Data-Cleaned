Generally, you may opt out of such emails which are not promotional in nature by editing your notifications settings, though CoachBase reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary e-mail notifications.\n                  When you use CoachBase as a potential coaching client, you may request/purchase a consultation directly from one of the coaches listed in our directory as part of the booking process or participate in our Referral Program.\n                  If you request a consultation as part of the booking process, we will ask for your name, phone, location/time-zone, email address and your comments if any via the Platform to process the booking and payment if any on your behalf. You and your Coach will receive emails with the booking and payment details.\n                  If you participate in the CoachBase Client Referral Program (i.e., get a Coach recommended to you), we ask for your name, email address, phone number (optional), location, your goal for hiring a coach, and any additional details that pertain to your request for a coach. By default, we will publish your request (not including personally identifiable details) as a means for communicating to Coaches your request.

In all cases, CoachBase stores personal information to track the success of our services.\n                \n                \n                  6. How do we use cookies and other tracking tools?\n                  As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\n                  We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.\n                  The Website may track personal information using software, cookies and tracking tools (e.g., cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts etc.). This information is used by CoachBase and our analytics affiliate, or email partner.\n                  These technologies are used in generating statistics, measuring and collecting session information, including page response times, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information, and methods used to browse away from the page, analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users\u2019 movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.\n                  We use cookies to remember users\u2019 settings (e.g., language preference) and for authentication.

The Coach may modify or delete any of his/her profile information at any time by logging into your account and submitting the changes to us.\n                  Individuals who wish to cancel their CoachBase account may do so from their profile page. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available.\n                  We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. Our default retention period is 24 months, but we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\n                \n                \n                  8.Security\n                  The security of your personal information is important to us.

Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n                  Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we recommend you to be mindful of the private information you share with us by e-mail or instant messaging services.\n                \n                \n                  9.Release of information\n                  The Coach may engage in training and continuing education pursuing and/or maintaining Coaching credentials. That process may require the names and contact information of Clients for possible verification by the coaching organizations granting these credentials. By buying coaching services on the Platform, Clients agree to have only their name, contact information, and start and end dates of coaching shared with staff members of these coaching organizations and/or other parties involved in this process for the sole and necessary purpose of verifying the coaching relationship for professional accreditation purposes.\n                  According to the ethics of the coaching profession, topics may be anonymously and hypothetically shared with other coaching professionals for training, supervision, mentoring, evaluation, and for coach professional development and/or consultation purposes.\n                \n                \n                  10.Record retention policy\n                  The Client acknowledges that the Coach has their own record retention policy with respect to documents, information and data acquired or shared during the term of the Coach-Client relationship. Such records need to be maintained by the Coach in a format of the Coach\u2019s choice (e.g., print or digital/electronic) and secured/treated confidentially throughout the contract and for a period of not more than 24 months after contract termination. The Coach commits to send the notes to the Client on request, and to destroy them after 24 months.\n                \n                \n                  11.Privacy policy updates\n                  We reserve the right to modify this data privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.
