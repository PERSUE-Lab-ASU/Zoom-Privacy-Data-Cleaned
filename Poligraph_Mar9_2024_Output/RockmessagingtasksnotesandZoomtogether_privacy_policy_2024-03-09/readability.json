If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at support@rock.so or through the Rock Support space.\nAccess\nYou have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months.

Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request. You can also delete your data through your Account Settings on Rock.\nExercising Your Rights\nTo exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request (1) from the Rock account in question and verify your identity with the email address or phone number which was previously used for authentication with Rock, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a \u201cValid Request.\u201d We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.\nWe will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.\nYou may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:\n\n\n \t\nSend us a message through space.new/support\n\n \t\nEmail us at: support@rock.so\n\n \t\nCall us at: 415-789-6080\n\n\nYou may also authorize an agent (an \u201cAuthorized Agent\u201d) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.\nPersonal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In\nWe will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months. To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.\nWe Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA\nWe will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.\u00a0\nOther State Law Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Resident Rights\nUnder California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for such third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at support@rock.so.\u00a0\nNevada Resident Rights\nIf you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Data to third parties who intend to license or sell that Personal Data.

Rock will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.\nIf there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at support@rock.so. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers\u2019 end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data.

In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n \t\nAccess:\u00a0 You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data\u00a0 by logging on to your account and requesting this through the Rock Support space.\n\n \t\nRectification:\u00a0 If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data.

You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.\u00a0\n\n \t\nObjection:\u00a0 You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your Personal Data for certain purposes, such as for direct marketing purposes.\u00a0\n\n \t\nRestriction of Processing:\u00a0 You can ask us to restrict further processing of your Personal Data.\n\n \t\nRight to File Complaint:\u00a0 You have the right to lodge a complaint about Rock's practices with respect to your Personal Data with the supervisory authority of your country or EU Member State.

Please note that if you\u2019ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven\u2019t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.
