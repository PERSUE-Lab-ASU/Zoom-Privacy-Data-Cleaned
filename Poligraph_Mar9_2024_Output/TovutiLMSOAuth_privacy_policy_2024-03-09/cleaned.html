Information about you (such as email address) as well as cookies and other tracking technologies (described above) may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, we may use that information to cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on that product.</p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please see the Opt-Out Process/Options and Additional Terms below.</p>

<h3>Contests and Promotions.</h3>
<p>If contests or promotions are made available, the applicable contest or promotion rules may include rules regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. To the extent that those specific rules conflict with this Privacy Policy, the contest or promotion rules will supersede this Privacy Policy with respect to the conflicting terms and the non-conflicting terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use will continue to apply.</p>
<h3>Your Choices.</h3>
<p>We strive to offer you with choices about how information is used and shared. There are several ways in which you may opt out of the various programs and services we provide. Some of the ways in which you may opt out are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of Our Services.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If you receive a marketing email from us, you may unsubscribe from future marketing emails in accordance with our standard unsubscribe process.</p>
<p><strong>Interest-Based Advertising Opt-Out and Do Not Track Signals.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>With respect to “do not track” (a/k/a “DNT”) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers, the Website does not respond to or honor such signals or mechanisms. This means that third parties, such as ad networks, web analytics companies, and social networking platforms (some of whom are discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy), may collect information about your online activities over time and across our Website and other third-party online properties or services. These companies may use information about your visits to our Website and other sites, and general geographic information derived from your IP address, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, please visit http://www.networkadverDsing.org/choices/. This is a site offered by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) that includes information on how consumers can opt- out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of NAI's members. You can also visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices, which is a site offered by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) that includes information on how consumers can opt-out from receiving internet-based advertising from some or all of DAA's participating companies. Opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer see any advertisements; rather, you will still see advertisements that are general and not tailored to your specific interests and activities. Further, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.</p>
<p><strong>We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way.</strong></p>
<h3>Data Security.</h3>
<p>We will implement reasonable and appropriate security procedures consistent with prevailing industry standards to protect data from unauthorized access by physical and electronic intrusion. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of data storage can be guaranteed 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information by following generally accepted industry standards, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or archive at this site.</p>
<p>When you transmit Personal Information through our registration process or if you purchase products or services, we encrypt that information in transit using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We do not store your credit card information in our systems. All credit card transactions are processed using secure encryption - the same level of encryption used by leading banks. Card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely at gateways on a PCI-compliant network.</p>
<h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</h3>
<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of the Company or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.</p>
<h3>California “Shine the Light”.</h3>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine the Light”), California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship: (a) a list of the categories of personal information, as defined under Shine the Light, such as name, email address and mailing address and the type of services provided to the customer that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes; and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties. If you are a California resident: (i) to request the above information, or (ii) if you do not want your personal information shared with any third party who may use such information for direct marketing purposes and wish to opt out of such disclosures, please contact us by email at legal@tovutiteam.com.</p>
<p>Please note that under Shine the Light, we are not responsible for removing your personal information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your information, and any elections or privacy choices you may make with respect to receipt of certain types of e-mails or marketing communications from us will not apply to any such third parties.
