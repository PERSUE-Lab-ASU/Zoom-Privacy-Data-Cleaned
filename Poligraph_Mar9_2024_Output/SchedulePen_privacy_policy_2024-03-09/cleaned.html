                                    <p>Security of your data is our first priority and this page outlines some of our operating procedures and security practices.</p>

                                    <p>We encrypt all sensitive data at rest in our database using AES-256 encryption. Our data is also encrypted in transit by using a 
                                     Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client.
                                     This means no sensitive data is stored in our database as plain text, including
                                     names, email addresses, user editable fields and passwords.</p>
                                     
                                    <p>We take daily backups of our databases using two seperate backup providers and store the backups on different servers 
                                    to the ones we use to serve our software.</p>

                                    <p>Logging<br>
                                    We track every action on the site through our audit log function. This includes login, the time, user details and IP address. This data is automatically purged after a period of time.</p>
                                    <p>Access<br>
                                    We have a password policy requiring passwords must be at least 8 characters in length and must contain at least one number, one upper case letter, one lower case letter and one special character. Passwords are stored using a non-reversible method.
                                    If users forget their credentials, they can only reset their password after receiving an email with a time-restricted link. 
                                    Users are automatically logged out of the system after a period of inactivity.
                                    Users who attempt to login with invalid credentials too many times will be temporarily blocked from the system.</p>

                                    <p>We are the data controller of your user account details, which includes your company name, your name and email address. We may also store information about your browser and how you use the system. We will send you transactional emails (e.g. invoices, legal document changes and account warning), and if you have opted-in to marketing emails, you may receive occasional marketing emails.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>We are the data processor for all information added by users (including interviewers and candidates). This is likely to include the following types of data:</p>

                                    <p>We process data under the contractual lawful basis, with a contract between us and the user. The user will be collecting data about its members using its own lawful processing basis.</p>

                                    <h2 class="mb-3">Data Subject Rights</h2>
                                    <p>Breach Notification<br>
                                    We will notify our users of any breach of data via email within 72hrs of identifying the breach.</p>

                                    <p>Right to Access<br>
                                    Users are able to download information about members if required, and the support team can provide assistance if the downloads are not sufficient.</p>

                                    <p>Right for Erasure<br>
                                    Users are able to delete all personal data, including from the audit trail.</p>

                                    <p>Data Portability<br>
                                    Users can download personal information in a spreadsheet format. It should be noted that this requirement is only applicable if you use 'consent' for your lawful processing mechanism. 'Legitimate interests' is likely to be more appropriate and therefore consent is not required, as the data provided by parents is expected to be stored and processed for the purposes of normal organisational operations.</p>
