			<h4>4. Cookies.</h4>
			
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.1. This site uses cookies to enable us to improve our service to you and to provide certain features that you&nbsp; may find useful. You may visit the Privacy Preference Center on the website to manage your consent preferences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.2. Cookies are small text files that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser to&nbsp; enable us to recognise your browser and help us to track visitors to our site. A cookie contains your contact&nbsp; information and information to allow us to identify your computer when you travel around our site for the purpose&nbsp; of helping you accomplish your purpose. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you wish, you can&nbsp; set your browser to prevent it from accepting cookies. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies and how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.3. We use cookies to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.4. A number of cookies and similar technologies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser or exit the website. Others are used to remember you when you return to the&nbsp; website and will last for longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.5. We use these cookies and other technologies on the basis that they are necessary for the performance of&nbsp; a service to you, or because using them is in our legitimate interests (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights), and, in some cases, where required by law, where you have consented to their use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.6. We use the following types of cookies:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.6.1. Strictly necessary cookies. These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched&nbsp; off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for&nbsp; services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or&nbsp; alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;identifiable information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.6.2. Performance cookies. These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and&nbsp; improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see&nbsp; how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If&nbsp; you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.6.3. Functionality cookies. These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.6.4. Targeting/Advertising cookies. These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They&nbsp; may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet&nbsp; device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.6.5. We may also work with advertising networks that gather information about the content on our website you visit and on information on other websites and services you visit.

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.1. The length of time for which we retain your personal data depends on the type of personal data and the purposes for which we are processing it. We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the&nbsp; purposes we collected it for or otherwise permitted by applicable laws.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.2. We have put in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security of all personal data from the point of collection to the point of destruction.

<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confidentiality means that only people who are authorised to use the data can access it</span></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Availability means that authorised users should be able to access the data if they need it for authorised purposes.&nbsp;</span></li>

			<h4>9. International Transfers.</h4>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.1. When we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure an adequate degree of protection is&nbsp; afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.3.

For further details, see European Commission: </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>9.1.4. The personal data that we collect and process must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes.</p>
<p>9.1.5. The personal data that we collect and process must be accurate and (where necessary) kept up to-date.</p>
<p>9.1.6. We must not keep personal data any longer than is necessary, bearing the purpose for which we collected it. This includes that we should keep personal data in a form which permits identification of the data subject for no longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>9.1.7. We must keep personal data safe and secure from unauthorised access, deletion, disclosure or other unauthorised uses. This includes not just keeping data safe and secure from persons outside our organisation, but also from people within our organisation who have no need to access or use the personal data. We must also be careful when transferring personal data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”, being the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), and make sure that we have a valid legal basis on which to transfer that data. Transfer can include using a cloud server that is located outside the EU or allowing people who are located outside the EEA access to personal data that is stored within the EEA.</p>
<p>9.1.8. We must comply with data subjects’ rights of information about, and (separately) access to, their personal data and with their other data protection rights, including rights to correct or erase their personal data, rights “to be forgotten”, rights to object to processing (including profiling), rights against automated decision-making and (under the GDPR) rights to data portability.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10.2. Specifically, we need to have written agreements in place with all our data processors and, before we sign each agreement, we need to have vetted and be satisfied with the processor’s data security. The agreements also need to contain specific clauses that deal with data protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10.3. We may pass on your details if we are under a duty to disclose or share a data subject’s personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any contract with the data subject or other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety of our employees, customers, or others.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10.5. We need to demonstrate accountability for our data protection obligations. This means that we must be able to show how we comply with the data protection rules, and that we have in fact complied with the rules. We do this, among other ways, by our written policies and procedures, by building data protection compliance into our systems and business rules, by internally monitoring our data protection compliance and keeping it under review, and by taking action if our employees or contractors fail to follow the rules. We also have certain obligations in relation to keeping records about our data processing.</span></p>
