(\u201cObsidian\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d) collects, uses, stores, and discloses information from users (\u201cyou\u201d, \u201cyour\u201d) of our website at obsidiansecurity.com, job applicants to Obsidian Security, and people who interact with our social media or other public facing web content. The Obsidian Website Privacy Policy does not govern personal data of or about current or past Obsidian Security employees or contractors or current or past corporate customers or individuals covered by our cybersecurity product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><em>A list of all privacy policies related to Obsidian Security</em></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Obsidian maintains three privacy policies:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>This Obsidian Security Website Privacy Policy that governs use of obsidiansecurity.com, Obsidian\u2019s social media posts,&nbsp; job applicants to Obsidian Security, and others interacting with Obsidian Security\u2019s public-facing web presence.&nbsp;</li><li>Obsidian Security Employee Privacy Policy that governs Obsidian\u2019s relationship with its employees.

We believe that users of our website should be afforded reasonable privacy protections by default and should be empowered to have their personal data deleted by request, regardless of where they live.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we encourage everyone to read our entire website privacy policy, we summarized key takeaways here:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Obsidian Security does not sell users\u2019 personal data to third parties.&nbsp;</li><li>In some circumstances, Obsidian Security may share small amounts of data about you.&nbsp;<ul><li><em>With our partners:</em><br>If you register to attend an event, webinar, or other activity through our website or links posted to our social media accounts which is run jointly with one or more of our partners, we may share your name, email address, and job title with the partner or partners co-hosting or co-sponsoring that event or activity.</li><li><em>With third party platforms</em>:<br>Obsidian uses third party platforms like Hubspot and Google Analytics for marketing and LinkedIn and Lever.com for recruiting and hiring.

We also gather information about the link that landed you at obsidiansecurity.com. We use this information to improve the content on obsidiansecurity.com and our overall communication strategy.</li><li>You may download our whitepapers and reports without manually submitting any additional personal information.</li><li>You can choose to share additional information with us like your name, email address, employer, job title, and phone number by entering your information into web forms for requesting a demo, attending a webinar, registering for an in-person event, receiving our newsletter, or filling out new web forms we may add in the future. Sharing your name, email address, and other information we request on our web forms is&nbsp; optional, but some aspects of our web presence may not work without these details (e.g. attending a webinar).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If you choose to follow Obsidian Security accounts on Twitter or LinkedIn or otherwise interact with us on social media, we may retain your social media account information, such as your name, your account handle, your publicly available bio, your stated location, and the dates and content of any interactions, including follows.</li><li>All of our emails have opt-out links to make it easy for you to unsubscribe.</li><li>You can also request to opt-out or to delete data you have previously submitted through our web forms by emailing <a href=\"mailto:privacy@obsidiansecurity.com\">privacy@obsidiansecurity.com</a>.

During the recruitment process, Obsidian Security will store and process comprehensive data about job applicants that the job applicants have made available publicly on sites such as LinkedIn and Twitter, and privately, by receiving resum\u00e9s, CVs, cover letters and other materials through web-based submission portals, or by communications made by candidates and recruits directly to Obsidian hiring managers and recruiting personnel. Because the data submitted by candidates may vary from job to job and candidate to candidate, it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of all data categories Obsidian may obtain from any particular candidate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following list is provided to suggest the categories of data Obsidian routinely processes from job candidates:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Candidates\u2019 Name<br>\u2013 Candidates\u2019 email address<br>\u2013 Candidates\u2019 phone number<br>\u2013 Candidates\u2019 current city, including street address <br>\u2013 Names of candidates\u2019 past and current employers<br>\u2013 Candidates\u2019 tenure and job title in past and current positions<br>\u2013 Candidates\u2019 educational attainment including degrees completed, institutions attended, fellowships, awards, and grants (if any)<br>\u2013 Information posted by candidate on candidates\u2019 LinkedIn page, if available<br>\u2013 Publicly available evidence of candidates\u2019 past relevant work (e.g. publications in scholarly journals, publicly available professional blogs, publicly available news coverage, publicly available video recordings of relevant professional presentations)<br>\u2013 Publicly available evidence of candidates\u2019 service to their professional community<br>\u2013 Candidates\u2019 stated interest in applying for particular positions at Obsidian Security<br>\u2013 If a candidate makes a site visit to Obsidian Security, their photo will be captured and stored as part of our on-site security protocol</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For certain jobs, there may be additional personal information gathered.
