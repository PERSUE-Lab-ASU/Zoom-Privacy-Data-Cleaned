We will deny requests from agents that do not submit proof of authorization from you. Which information may depend on the type and sensitivity of information requested. For clarity, making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in the request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it. </p>\n<p>Your request to know, delete, correct, opt out, or restrict processing must:\u202f1) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and\u202f2) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\u202f <strong><br></strong></p>\n<h3>B.

You will need to provide us certain information so that we can verify that you are who you say you are. </p>\n<p>We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\u202fWe will response to your request within the legally required amount of time. </p>\n<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. </p>\n<p>In certain cases, a request may be denied. For example, if we cannot verify your identity or if providing you information could create an unreasonable risk to someone\u2019s security (for example, we do not want very sensitive information disclosed inappropriately). If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it. </p>\n<p>Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to re-confirm your preferences with regards to Personal Information sharing and/or use of Sensitive Personal Information.
