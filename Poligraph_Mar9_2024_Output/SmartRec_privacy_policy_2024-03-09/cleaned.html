<h3>b.	With your consent</h3>
<p>We generally collect your Personal Information with your consent, unless applicable law provides an exception to this principle. </p>
<h3>c.	Refusal of collection and withdrawal of your consent</h3>
<p>You have the right, if you wish, to refuse the processing of your Personal Information. You may also, at any time, and subject to reasonable notice and any applicable legal or contractual restrictions, withdraw your consent (if any) to the processing of your Personal Information in our possession by contacting us.

<h3>4.	WHY WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? </h3>
<h3>a.	For specific and limited purposes and legitimate interests</h3>
<p>We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your payments to use the Platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your Personal Information for a reason related to their business (for example, for a Merchant to provide you with a service). European law calls these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include:  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>preventing risk and fraud  </li><li>answering questions or providing other types of support  </li><li>helping Merchants find and use apps through our app store  </li><li>providing and improving our products and services  </li><li>providing reporting and analytics  </li><li>testing out features or additional services  </li><li>assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications </li></ul>
<p>(collectively, the "<strong>Purposes</strong>"). </p>
<p>We only process Personal Information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy by providing, namely, clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your Personal Information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your Personal information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your Personal Information.  </p>
<p>We may process your Personal Information where you have provided your consent. In particular, where we cannot rely on an alternative legal basis for processing, where your data is sourced and it already comes with consent or where we are required by law to ask for your consent in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities. At any time, you have a right to withdraw your consent by changing your communication choices, opting out from our communications or by contacting us.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>b.	For marketing purposes</h3>
<p>We use the Personal Information you provide to us to market and promote our Services, as well as to send you marketing communications relating to our business. If you have consented to receive such information, Amilia may send you newsletters, electronic messages such as emails, news, updates and/or other written communications ("<strong>Messages</strong>") about Amilia’s services. We use Personal Information, such as your email or physical address, to send promotional information, targeted advertising or content to you which we think may be of interest to you, in accordance with your communication preferences. </p>
<p>We may also reach out to you via telephone to ask about other products or services you may be interested in. If you have a call with an Amilia’s representative, we may record and transcribe the call. You will be notified prior to the recording that the call is being recorded, and you will be offered an opportunity to opt-out of having the call recorded. </p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving Messages in the manner described in the "<strong>How to Contact Us</strong>" section or through the unsubscribe link included in the Messages. However, Amilia may continue to send you Messages to inform you of functionality updates and transactional information, critical technical issues related to the Platform or services you have requested, or to provide you with important information about your account (if any). </p>
<h3>c.	For secondary purposes </h3>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, Amilia may also aggregate and anonymize the Personal Information you have provided, in order to create statistical data that Amilia may use for secondary purposes (such as market research and cultural community studies), to improve the Platform or our Services, to examine trends or to respond to statistical requests from of our partners. This statistical data does not include Personal Information.  </p>
<h3>5.	WHERE IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION HOSTED AND TRANSFERRED? </h3>
<p>Your Personal Information may be held by Amilia in jurisdictions other than your province, territory or country of residence, including in Canada, the United States and the province of Quebec. Amilia may also outsource the processing or share your Personal Information with third parties located in areas other than your province, territory, or country of residence. If you are based in Quebec, Canada or US, this may involve transferring your Personal Information outside Quebec, Canada or US. </p>
<p>If Personal Information is transferred to a location outside of these jurisdictions we endeavor to limit access to Personal Information to these third parties to what is necessary to perform the tasks entrusted to them. We will also put in place contractual agreements with these agents and third parties service providers to ensure the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information. This may include ensuring they implement robust and effective security measures. </p>
<h3>6.	HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
<h3> a.	With necessary and appropriate measures: </h3>

For further details about this information, please visit the “<em><a href="#US-personal-information-we-collect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Personal Information We Collect</a></em><em>”</em> section above.

<h3>5.4 Right to opt out of disclosures of personal information for cross-context behavioural advertising purposes (“sharing” under California law): </h3>
<p>Residents of certain U.S. states have the right to opt out of the sale of their Personal Information and of the disclosure of Personal Information for cross-contextual behavioural advertising by Amilia (which is referred to as “sharing” under the CCPA). We do not sell your Personal Information. However, when you visit the Services, we may share information about your use of our Services with our advertising and analytics partners. You can opt out of sharing or using your Personal Information for the purposes of targeted advertising by interacting with the cookie banner or by using the “Cookie Consent Tool” for each website you visit. We also accept certain opt-out preference signals sent from your browser that will opt you out of the sale and disclosure of your personal information for purposes of targeted advertising. Depending on how you have interacted with our services and our ability to identify you, this may only opt you out of disclosures for purposes of targeted advertising that take place via cookies. You can also opt out of sharing or using your Personal Information for the purposes of targeted advertising by visiting the following Internet <a href="https://intercom.help/amilia/en/articles/3430296-your-data-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">webpage link</a>.</p>
<p>Details on your right to opt out are listed in the following state sections below: </p>
<ul><li>California </li><li>Colorado</li></ul>
<h3>5.5 Right to Non-Discrimination: </h3>
<p>You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Amilia for exercising any of your privacy rights conferred by your state’s consumer privacy laws. Amilia will not discriminate against any consumer because such person exercised any of the consumer’s rights under these privacy laws, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>Denying goods or services. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties. </li><li>Providing a different level or quality of goods or services. </li><li>Suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li></ul>
<p>Amilia may, however, charge a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is related to the value provided to you by your data. </p>
<h3>5.6 Exercising Your Rights </h3>
<h3>A. How to Contact Us</h3>
<p>If you are a resident of a jurisdiction where one or more of these rights are granted to you under applicable law, and you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, wish to exercise your rights, please contact us by either:    </p>
<p><strong>Mail:</strong>	<br>Privacy Officer <br>Address: #3.105 - 1751 Richardson St. <br>Montreal (Quebec) <br>H3K 1G6 <br>CANADA   </p>
<p>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@amilia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>privacy@amilia.com</strong></a> <br>Phone number:   1-877-343-0004 </p>
<p>Web: <strong><a href="https://intercom.help/amilia/en/articles/3430296-your-data-privacy">https://intercom.help/amilia/e...</a></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. Please understand that we are required to verify your request and may require you to provide some information to enable us to carry out such verification. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Amilia will need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before the request will be processed, and we may require a copy of a power of attorney or require that you provide the authorized agent with written permission and verify your own identity with us. We will deny requests from agents that do not submit proof of authorization from you. Which information may depend on the type and sensitivity of information requested. For clarity, making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in the request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it. </p>
<p>Your request to know, delete, correct, opt out, or restrict processing must: 1) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and 2) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.  <strong><br></strong></p>
<h3>B. Response Timing and Format </h3>
<p>When you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, make a consumer request related to your Personal Information, you can expect the following: </p>
<p>We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@amilia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>privacy@amilia.com</strong></a>. </p>
<p>We will verify your identity. You will need to provide us certain information so that we can verify that you are who you say you are. </p>
<p>We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will response to your request within the legally required amount of time. </p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. </p>
<p>In certain cases, a request may be denied. For example, if we cannot verify your identity or if providing you information could create an unreasonable risk to someone’s security (for example, we do not want very sensitive information disclosed inappropriately). If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it. </p>
<p>Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to re-confirm your preferences with regards to Personal Information sharing and/or use of Sensitive Personal Information. However, you may change your mind and opt-in again at any time and manage your preferences as you see fit by contacting us as set above. </p>
<h3>California Residents’ Privacy Rights </h3>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act, which has been amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “<strong>CCPA</strong>”), is a law intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of the State of California. The CCPA applies to certain business entities that do business in California. For further details on the types of Personal Information we have collected about you, the sources of that information, how we use the information (e.g., our business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling Personal Information), other individuals and businesses with whom we disclose Personal Information, and the specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you, please visit the “<em><a href="#US-personal-information-we-collect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Personal Information We Collect</a></em>” section above. </p>
<p>The following rights, as described in detail in “<em>State-Specific Ri</em>ghts<em> &amp; Choices</em>” section above, apply to all California residents (but not including legal entities, such as companies): </p>
<ul><li>The Right to Know. </li><li>The Right to receive (“access”) a copy of your Personal Information. </li><li>The right to request erasure of your Personal Information. </li><li>The Right to Correct. </li><li>The right to opt out of sales or certain disclosures (“sharing”) of your Personal Information. To exercise the right to opt out, you (or your authorized representative) can submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet web page link: <em><a href="https://intercom.help/amilia/en/articles/3430296-your-data-privacy#5-delete-your-data">https://intercom.help/amilia/e...</a></em>. For clarity, we do not sell your Personal Information. </li><li>The right to limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information. For clarity, we do not use your Sensitive Personal Information to infer characteristics about you.</li></ul>
<p>To make a request under the CCPA, you may call 1-877-343-0004, email <a href="mailto:privacy@amilia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>privacy@amilia.com</strong></a>, or using this link: <a href="https://intercom.help/amilia/en/articles/3430296-your-data-privacy#5-delete-your-data">https://intercom.help/amilia/e...</a>;</p>
<p>As stated above, the CCPA also gives California residents the right to request that businesses opt them out of the sale or sharing of their Personal Information. Our practices for how we disclose Personal Information for targeted advertising are set forth in the chart above. Like most websites, our websites use cookies and other technologies to interact with third parties and service providers for things like website analytics and advertising. Some of this website interaction with third parties may be viewed as a “sale” under the CCPA, and you can opt out that sharing of Personal Information. </p>
<h3>COLORADO RESIDENTS’ PRIVACY RIGHTS </h3>
<p><strong>Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)</strong> </p>
<p>The Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) is a law intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of the State of Colorado. For further details on the types of Personally Identifiable Information we have collected about you, the sources of that information, how we use the information (e.g., our business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling Personal Information), other individuals and business with whom we share personal information, and the specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you, please visit the “<a href="#US-personal-information-we-collect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Personal </em>Information We Collect</a>” section above. </p>
<p>The following rights, as described in detail in the “<em>State-Specific</em> Rights &amp; Choices” section apply to all Colorado residents (but not including legal entities, such as companies): </p>
<ul><li>The Right to Know. </li><li>The right to receive (“access”) a copy of your Personal Information. </li><li>The Right to Correct. </li><li>The right to request erasure of your Personal Information. </li><li>The right to opt out of sales or certain disclosures of your Personal Information (for more information about your right to opt-out, please see the following Internet <a href="https://intercom.help/amilia/en/articles/3430296-your-data-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web page link</a>. For clarity, Amilia does not sell your Personal Information. </li><li>The right to opt out of the profiling in furtherance of legal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer </li></ul>
<ul><li>The right to appeal a controller’s refusal to take action regarding a privacy rights request. </li></ul>
<p>The rights will not apply, however, if Amilia does not collect any Personal Information about you or if all of the information we collect is exempt from the statute (for example, the CPA does not protect information that is already protected by certain other privacy laws, and does not protect information that is already publicly available). </p>
<h3>Requests under CPA </h3>
<p>To make a request under the CPA you may call 1-877-343-0004, email <a href="mailto:privacy@amilia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy@amilia.com</a>, or visit this <a href="https://intercom.help/amilia/en/articles/3430296-your-data-privacy#5-delete-your-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web page</a><b>.</b></p>
