You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.&nbsp; When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.&nbsp; If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).&nbsp; If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p><p><strong>Opt out of communications</strong>: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.&nbsp; Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services.

Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.\u00a0 For example, we continue to display votes you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided.Managed accounts: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.\u00a0 For more information, see \"Managed accounts and administrators\" above.Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Junction account.\u00a0 We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.How to access and control your informationYou have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information.

Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see \"Notice to End Users\" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.\u00a0 For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.\u00a0 Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.\u00a0 If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.Access and update your information: Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access and delete questions or answers directly from your account.Deactivate your account:\u00a0 If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account by contacting us at Junction support (support@tryjunction.com).\u00a0 Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services.\u00a0 For more information on how to delete your information, see below.Delete your information: Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service.

You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.\u00a0 When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.\u00a0 If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).\u00a0 If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.Opt out of communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.\u00a0 Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services.

Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.Data portability: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier).\u00a0 Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.\u00a0 Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole control i.e. a workspace where you are the sole administrator.Other important privacy informationNotice to End UsersMany of our products are intended for use by organizations.
