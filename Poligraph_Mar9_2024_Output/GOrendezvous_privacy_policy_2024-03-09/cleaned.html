This Privacy Notice is part of the Terms of Use posted by GOrendezvous, located at 500-1275 Av. des Canadiens-de-Montreal, Montreal, Canada. Hereinafter called the "Company".
<br><br>
If the Professional or the Client does not wish to have their personal data collected and processed under the conditions of this Privacy Notice, they must refrain from using the Services offered by the Company.
</div>
<div class="title">
ARTICLE 1. PURPOSE
</div>
<div class="text">
The Company has developed a Software as a Service solution to manage and book patient and client (the “Client”) appointments and reservations online, as well as manage Client records (the “Services”), for professionals from different professions (the "Professional").
</div>
<div class="title">
ARTICLE 2. CONTROLLER AND PROCESSOR
</div>
<div class="text">
The entity responsible for the processing of the personal data of the Professional and its Clients is the Company. The controller of the personal data is the Professional, the Company having, in the latter case, the quality of “Service Provider”.
</div>
<div class="title">
ARTICLE 3. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA
</div>
<div class="text">
The Company collects personal data directly from the Professionals and their Clients via the Services offered via its website, applications, or other means.
<br><br>
Personal data may also be collected from third-party applications used by the Professionals to perform their duties.
These third-party applications may be connected to the Company’s application to feed the personal data required to offer the Company’s Services to Professionals and their Clients.
Once this external personal data has been entered into the Company’s application, it is subject to this Privacy Notice.
For information on how personal data is handled by these third-party applications, Professionals and Clients should consult the privacy notices of those third parties.
</div>
<div class="title">
ARTICLE 4. PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
</div>
<div class="text">
The Company processes and stores the personal data provided by the Professionals and their Clients only for the strict execution and use of the Services it offers.
The Company will not collect any other personal data without the explicit consent of the Professional or their Clients.
The Company informs its Professionals and Clients that all personal data is generally stored and processed in Canada, but that some specific third-party services may involve the storage and processing of personal data in other countries, including the United States of America.
</div>
<div class="title">
ARTICLE 5. COMPLIANCE
</div>
<div class="text">
The Company, concerned about the personal data of the Professional and its Clients, undertakes to ensure the conformity of the processes, people, and technology, in its role of processor and Service Provider respectively, under the Terms of Use, in accordance with applicable privacy laws, including PIPEDA (Canada), PHIPA (Ontario), LPRPSP (including the new Law 25 requirements, Québec) and the GDPR (Europe).
To do this, the Company has put in place strict internal Privacy and Security Policies, in order to guarantee an optimal level of protection of the personal data collected by the Professional.
</div>
<div class="title">
ARTICLE 6. PROFESSIONAL PERSONAL DATA
</div>
<div class="text">
To benefit from the Services offered by the Company, the Professional must log in to the GOrendezvous website by creating an account.
When registering, the Professional must communicate some information, which in some jurisdictions may be considered personal data, including: last name and first name, email, profession, name of the business of the Professional, business address of the professional, and business phone Number.
<br><br>
All answers are required, including at the time of account activation, in order to enable the strict performance of the Company's Services. The Professional agrees to communicate accurate, complete, and updated data on their identity and personal information.
<br><br>
The Professional is informed that the Company uses a payment provider (the "Payment Provider") to process all financial transactions related to the Services.
The Company does not collect, process, store, or house any personal data of a banking nature, which are collected, processed and hosted directly and solely by the Payment Provider on behalf of the Company.
The Professional is informed that the current Payment Provider is Stripe, located in San Francisco, in the United States of America. The Company has ensured compliance of the Payment Provider with applicable privacy requirements.
</div>
<div class="title">
ARTICLE 7. CLIENT PERSONAL DATA
</div>
<div class="text">
To book an appointment with a listed Professional, the Client must visit the GOrendezvous website or interact with a provided web interface (“Booking Widget”) hosted on a third-party website and communicate certain personal data, including their name, email address, phone number, date of birth and other personal data the Professional may need to perform their duties.
The Professional may also collect personal data directly from their Client during the appointments or over the phone.
<br><br>
In their capacity as primary data controller, the Professional undertakes to collect only the personal data needed from the Client to perform their professional activity.
<br><br>
As the data controller, the Professional agrees to comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations regarding personal data and, in particular, will allow their Clients to exercise their rights of access, rectification, objection, restriction, portability, and deletion or anonymization of data concerning them at any time.
The Company will assist the Professional to the best of its ability in fulfilling these Client rights.
</div>
<div class="title">
ARTICLE 8. CONSENT
</div>
<div class="text">
Because the Professional’s data collection and the Company’s data processing may involve health information, hence sensitive personal data, explicit consent is required, both by the Professional and their Clients, prior to the collection and processing of personal data.
<br><br>
This consent for personal data collection and processing may be revoked at any time by the Professional, temporarily by requesting a suspension of their account or permanently by closing their account with the Company.
<br><br>
Clients may revoke their consent to personal data collection and processing by contacting their Professional directly.
