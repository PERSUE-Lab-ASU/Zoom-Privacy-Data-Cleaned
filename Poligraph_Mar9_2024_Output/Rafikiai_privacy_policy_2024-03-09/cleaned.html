      <h3 class="cardheading">Data Processor</h3>
      <div class="normaltext">Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the CCPA/GDPR, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the “<strong>Data Processor</strong>” (or under the CCPA, “<strong>Business</strong>”), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “<strong>Data Processor</strong>" (or under the CCPA, “service provider”), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.<br><br>Rafiki is the “<strong>Data Processor</strong>” of the Rafiki Website, CRM &amp; Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our <strong>“Service Providers"</strong> processing such data will assume the role of “<strong>Data Processor</strong>””.<br><br>Rafiki is the “<strong>Data Processor</strong>” of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the <strong>“Data Processor”</strong> of such data; and our <strong>"Service Providers"</strong> who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the “sub-processors” of such data.<br><br>Rafiki is the “<strong>Data Processor</strong>” of Rafiki User Data. Such data is processed by Rafiki for its own purposes (as described in the Data Uses Section above), as an independent processor; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customer’s behalf, as a ‘processor’. Accordingly, Rafiki processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with such customer’s reasonable instructions and other commercial agreements with such customer. The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control). At Rafiki we strive to protect and secure our customers’ data to the highest levels, such as the data privacy obligations in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) – primarily the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). <br><br>For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data – including sufficient reference to the processing of their Personal Data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.<br><br></div>

We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.</div>
