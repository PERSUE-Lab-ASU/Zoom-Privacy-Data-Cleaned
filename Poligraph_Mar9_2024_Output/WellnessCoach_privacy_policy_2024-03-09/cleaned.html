For example, most of our services require you to set up an account or log into our services using 3rd party accounts such as Google and Facebook, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username you’d like to go by, a password, an email address, gender, city of user and age. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as profile pictures, a name, your current or other useful identifying information.</p><p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1.5s; transition-delay: 0.127007s;">Health data Collection and Use: It's your choice to share your health data with us. You can choose what data you want to share with us. We collect this data from sources like Apple Health and Google Health and/or any wearables that may be connected to these sources or connected independently. This data is used to help our members understand their wellness patterns, and offer tailored recommendations. This data can include metrics related to sleep, walking, physical workouts, and other wellness indicators. We also use this information for team challenges as e.g. for walking challenges, we would sync step count from your device to our platform and update the leaderboards.</p><p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1.5s; transition-delay: 0.131387s;">Health Data Consent: By connecting your Apple Health or Google Health or any account with health information with our platform, you provide explicit consent for us to access and use your health data as described in this privacy policy.

This allows you to interact with our Coaches and other students. We believe it's better to learn together. All these live sessions are recorded and may be used for promotions or future on-demand teachings, compliance with legal obligations or to enforce our <a href="https://www.wellnesscoach.live/codeofconduct?__hstc=753710.09a3964e2bb3b1af5b901f633dfd8604.1740584319692.1740584319692.1740584319692.1&amp;__hssc=753710.1.1740584319692&amp;__hsfp=3618309378">code of conduct</a>.

Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1.5s; transition-delay: 0.153285s;">Usage Information.

When sharing aggregated wellness metrics with employers or other third-party organizations, we provide data in an anonymized and aggregated format. This ensures that individual health data points cannot be traced back to a specific member.
