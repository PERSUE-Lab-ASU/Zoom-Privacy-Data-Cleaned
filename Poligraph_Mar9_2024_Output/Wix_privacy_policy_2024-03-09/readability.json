If you choose to engage with such Third Party Services, they may have access to and process Personal Information of your Users-of-Users collected through your web or mobile sites. For example:\n\na) Framed Pages: our Services may enable you to integrate Third Party Services directly into your web or mobile sites, such as via page framing techniques to serve content to or from Third Party Services\u00a0 or other parties (\u201cFrames\u201d).

Each Third Party Developer is bound by the Wix App Market Partner Agreement, which among other things, restricts the ways in which such developers may access, store, share, and use the Personal Information you and/or your Users-of-Users provide to them.\n\n\n\nc) Social Media Features: Our Services may enable you to integrate certain Social Media features, widgets, and single sign on features, such as \u201cFacebook Connect,\u201d or \u201cGoogle Sign-in\u201d (\u201cSocial Media Features\u201d) into your web or mobile sites. These Social Media Features may collect certain Personal Information from your Users-of-Users such as identifiers, including name, alias, unique personal identifier, online identifier, internet protocol address, email address, or other similar identifiers. Social Media Features are hosted either by a third party or directly on our Services.\n\n\n\nPlease note that in the examples listed above in this Section 4.6, Wix merely acts as an intermediary platform allowing you to procure the services of such Third Party Services (including, but not limited to, Third Party Developers, Third Party Apps and Social Media Features) with which you are interacting directly, and at your discretion. In this respect, Wix acts as a service provider to you, disclosing information to the Third Party Services on your behalf. Wix will share your Users-of-Users\u2019 Personal Information with Third Parties Services only upon your direction or with your permission and is not, and shall not be, in any way responsible for such Third Party Services processing of such Personal Information, or liable with respect thereto.\n\n\n\nWix does not control and is not responsible for the actions or policies of any Third Party Service, and your use of any Third Party Service is at your own risk. We encourage you to review any privacy policy accompanying a Third Party Service and ask such Third Party Service for any clarifications you may need before deciding to install and/or use their services.4.6. 5.

Where do we Store/Process your \u2018Personal Information\u2019?Wix processes data about individuals across the world and may transfer your Personal Information outside of your country. Your security, privacy and confidentiality are our top priority and that's why Wix conducts a vetting process that includes an assessment of the privacy laws in those countries to validate they have strong data protection laws. 5.1. User's personal information is controlled by Wix.com Ltd. in Israel, which the European Commission considers as a country offering an adequate level of protection for the Personal Information of E.U. Member State residents (see here).5.2. If you are in Europe, the U.K., or Switzerland, when we transfer your Personal Information to a location outside of Europe, We will make sure that (i) there is a level of protection deemed adequate by the European Commission or (ii) that the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses are in place (i.e., the applicable module of the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to Regulation (E.U.) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council from June 4, 2021, as available here, and the ICO\u2019s International Data Transfer Addendum to the E.U. Commission Standard Contractual Clauses version B1.0, in force from 21 March 2022, as it is revised under Section \u200e\u200e18 of its Mandatory Clauses), or (iii) we comply with Data Privacy Framework as applicable to data transfers to the United States and specified in clause 5.4 below, or (iv) we use another legally recognized transfer mechanism in the applicable jurisdiction.5.3. #ItsThatEasyWe may store and process Personal Information in the USA, Europe, Israel, or other jurisdictions, whether by ourselves or with the help of our affiliates and service providers.Wix\u2019s data storage providers are contractually committed to protect and secure your data.Among other things, Wix will ensure that there is the adequate level of protection or that relevant Standard Contractual Clauses are in place for the international transfer of our EU users\u2019 data.When Wix transfers E.U.

Wix commits to cooperate with the DPAs and comply with the advice given by such authorities.\n\n\n\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, you may - under certain conditions described on the Data Privacy Framework website - invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. For more information on this option, please see Annex I of the Data Privacy Framework Principles.5.4 6. Users-of-Users6.

Data Retention12. SecurityWix has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural measures. Among other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to most areas on our Services; the transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit card number) through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection; and we regularly maintain a PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) certification.

We encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account and User Website, and avoid providing us or anyone with any sensitive Personal Information of which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm.\n\nFurthermore, because certain areas on our Services are less secure than others (for example, if you set your Support forum ticket to be \u201cPublic\u201d instead of \u201cPrivate\u201d, or if you browse to a non-SSL page), and since e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any Personal Information on any of these areas or via any of these methods.\n\n\u200b\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are welcome to contact us here.#ItsThatEasyWix values the security of our customers' Personal Information and we do everything in our power to protect it.\u00a0\n\nHowever, as we can\u2019t guarantee absolute protection \u2013 we encourage you to be careful, set a strong password for your account, and avoid submitting any sensitive information which, if exposed, could cause you major harm.14.
