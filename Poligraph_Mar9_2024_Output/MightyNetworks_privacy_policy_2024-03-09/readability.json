A common purpose of aggregation is to get more information about particular groups based on specific variables such as age, profession, or income level.</span></p><p><strong><span>\u2018Pseudonymisation\u2019</span></strong><span> means the processing of your personal data in a way that the personal data can no longer identify you without the use of additional information, so long as the additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to prevent you from being identified or identifiable. We store and use your Personal Data together with an ID we assign each time you join a new Mighty Network. We assign you one ID per Mighty Network to ensure you have a personalized experience in each one.</span></p><p><strong><span>Name and Email Address.</span></strong><span> When you register as a Host or Member of a Mighty Network, we ask you for your real name and your email address. Both we and the Host of the Mighty Network receive access to this information and use it to communicate with you about the Service. In addition, we and your Host may use this address to email you about products or services believed to be of interest to you. If you are a paying Host or Member, we may also collect your mailing address and zip code for billing purposes. Hosts may decide to collect your mailing address, via our Services.</span></p><p><strong><span>Social Media Profiles.</span></strong><span> You can also register with your Facebook or LinkedIn account.

Our Hosts may also work with other companies who use their cookies or beacons to target third party ads to you on other websites based on your prior visits to the Host\u2019s Network on our website Service. This is called online behavioral advertising (\u201cOBA\u201d), because you receive ads based on your prior online behavior.
