          <li>
            <p>
              You provide some of it directly (such as by

            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              We receive some of it from third parties (like when you register
              for an account using a Third Party Service or when you make
              payments to us using our payment processor).
            </p>

        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>How we protect your personal information</h3>

          your information as long as is necessary to continue to meet your

          once your personal information is no longer needed, we will destroy
          it.
