Interest Based Advertising\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInterest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual\u2019s preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.\u00a0We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in the Binox MSP products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.\u00a0These third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which collect information about a person\u2019s interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.\u00a0In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties.

We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.\u00a0The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties\u2019 platforms.\u00a0We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads \u2013 for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person\u2019s perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.\u00a0Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.\u00a0Visitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers; and http://www.networkadvertising.org. These features will opt a Visitor out of many \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage.\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t10. Do Not Track Policy\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCalifornia law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated \u201cDo Not Track\u201d features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals.\u00a0In the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of this online behavioral advertising, visit the following sites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers and http://www.networkadvertising.org.\u00a0This will opt you out of many \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. Choices you make may be browser and device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out choices. Other third-party Sites provide visitors with the ability to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you need to control through your settings on that Site. For example, to opt out of Google\u2019s use of your online behavior for advertising purposes, visit Google\u2019s Ad Settings page.\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t11. Cookies\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCalifornia law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose whether other third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual\u2019s online activities from their site or service. We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.\u00a0The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.\u00a0The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests. It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.\u00a0We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Other than as discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties.\u00a0For more information on cookies and how we use them please see our cookie notice.\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t12.

If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal Data has been collected on the Service from persons under 18 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

Data Security\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWe follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.\u00a0However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section.\u00a0If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t14. Data Retention\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User\u2019s account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t15. Settings \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t16.
