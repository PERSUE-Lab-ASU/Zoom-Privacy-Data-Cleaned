Skilljar does not \u201csell\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d your personal information (as each of those terms are defined in the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA), and therefore your right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information under the CCPA does not apply.\n\n\nAccess to Specific Information and Data Portability.

Our Subscribers determine the lawful grounds for the processing of personal data submitted through their use of our Services and we limit such processing to our Subscribers\u2019 instructions.\nData Transfer Notice. We are located in the United States and transfer your personal data for processing in the United States. We make the transfer to the United States in the absence of an adequacy decision because it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or with your explicit consent.

All such opt-out preference signals are processed in a frictionless manner (as that term is defined by the CCPA). To learn more about how to implement opt-out preference signals and/or Global Privacy Control, you should consult your browser\u2019s privacy settings or visit the Global Privacy Control website.\nTo implement an opt-out preference signal on your device or browser, you may download the appropriate browser that uses a recognized opt-out preference signal or a browser extension that can be enabled to support your single opt-out preference signal. \nNote that our acknowledgment of opt-out preference signals are based on browser settings, not your device. If you use multiple devices, or if your browser settings do not carry over between devices, you may need to implement such opt-out preference signals across each of your devices and browsers to ensure that your preferences are properly recognized. \nChanges to Privacy Notice\nWe reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Notice at any time and from time to time.
