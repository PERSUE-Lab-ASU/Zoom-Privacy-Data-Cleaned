We will post a reasonably prominent notice to the Websites if any such security breach occurs.\n\t\t    Data Usage Policy: Non Personal Browsing and Site Usage Information\n\t\t    Our Data Usage Policy covers how we maintain and use information about you that is collected by our Websites and server logs, including when you log into a website using your SimpleVLE account.\n\t\t    Non Personal Browsing Information We Collect. When you use the Websites, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of your IP address) about your activities while visiting the Websites and information about the browser you are using. In addition, whenever you use your SimpleVLE SimpleVLE to log into a website, our servers (which, again, may be hosted by a third party service provider) keep a log of the websites you visit and when you visit them.\n\t\t    No Linking. We do not intentionally link browsing information or information from our SimpleVLE server logs to the personal information, posts, and data you submit to us. We use this information for internal purposes only, such as to help understand how the Websites are being used, to improve our Websites and the features we provide, and for systems administration purposes. SimpleVLE may use a third party analytics provider to help us collect and analyze non personal browsing information through operation of our Websites for those same purposes; however, we will never use a third party analytics provider to collect or analyze any information through our operations as a SimpleVLE service provider.\n\t\t    No Selling or Sharing. Except in the unique situations identified in this Privacy Policy, SimpleVLE does not sell or otherwise voluntarily provide the non personal browsing information we collect about you or your website usage to third parties.\n\t\t    No Access. As a SimpleVLE service provider, SimpleVLE could technically access your web-based account tied to our SimpleVLE service, and could log in on behalf of any of its SimpleVLE users to any of the accounts they have accessed using their SimpleVLE SimpleVLE. SimpleVLE will never use this technical login ability for any purpose unless otherwise required by law.\n\t\t    No Retention. SimpleVLE discards non personal browsing information from our SimpleVLE server logs once we have used the information for the limited purposes noted above, under No Linking.\n\t\t    Notice. If SimpleVLE is required to provide a third party with your non personal browsing information or to log in on behalf of a SimpleVLE user (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then SimpleVLE will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless SimpleVLE is prohibited by law from doing so or is otherwise advised not to notify you on the advice of legal counsel.\n\t\t    Any other non-personal information, posts, and data that we collect which is not described specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected and used in accordance with the Principles.\n\t\t    \n\t\t    Policy Related Specifically to Google Integration\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Data collected for the following purposes and using the following services:\n\t\t\t\tAccess to third-party accounts\n\t\t\t\tGoogle Drive account access\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Data: various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAnalytics\n\t\t\t\tGoogle Analytics\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Data: Cookies; Usage Data\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tRegistration and authentication\n\t\t\t\tGoogle OAuth\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Data: various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t    \n\t\t    \n\t\t    Policy Related Specifically to Zoom Integration\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Data collected for the following purposes and using the following services:\n\n\t\t\t\tZoom Account Authorization\n\t\t\t\tOAuth 2.0(Read Only)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPersonal Data: various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUser Identification\n\t\t\t\tUser API(Read Only)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPersonal Data: various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSite Generated Content \n\t\t\t\tMeetings API\n\t\t\t\t   Webinars API\n\t\t\t\t  Personal Data: various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \tOur data compliance agreement with Zoom: \n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t1. We have established a Deauthorization Endpoint URL that is called after a user uninstalls your app.\n\t\t\t\t2. We will retain user's data post app-uninstallation only if the user specifies to do so.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t3. We will inform Zoom that we have complied with the requirements by calling the Data Compliance API.\n\t\t\t\t* If a user chooses not to allow data retainment when uninstalling SimpleVLE's Zoom app, Zoom requires that a user's Zoom data be removed 10 days from that time. However, \n\t\t\t\tSimpleVLE will immediately delete the user's data and call the Data Compliance API in response to the uninstall when data retainment is not allowed.\n\t\t\t\tIf a user uninstalls the app but allows the data to be retained, SimpleVLE will retain the Zoom data for as long as permitted by law. \t\t\t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \n\t\t    \n\t\t    Policy Related Specifically to Facebook Login\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Data collected for the following purposes:\n\n\t\t\t\tFacebook Login Authorization\n\t\t\t\tOAuth 2.0(Read Only)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPersonal Data: Email, Name, and Facebook ID\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \tDeleting User Data from the SimpleVLE Platform \n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t1. We have established a Delete User Data Callback that is called from your Facebook account. This action deletes all your data from SimpleVLE, including all content created with this account.\n\t\t\t\t2. You may send us an email at support@simplevle.com and request that your data be deleted.\n\t\t\t\t* Important:  If you have an Intructor account and you request your data to be deleted, all content generated from that account will be deleted as well. This includes \n\t\t\t\t  student course history, grades, tests, etc. If you only want your profile deleted, but not any course content, do not use the 1st option. You must specify \n\t\t\t\t  that you only want your profile deleted in your email.\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \n\t\t    Reorganization or Spin-Offs\n\t\t    SimpleVLE may transfer some or all of your personal and/or non personal browsing information to a third party as a result of a reorganization, spin-off or similar transaction. Upon such transfer, the acquirer's privacy policy will apply. In such event, SimpleVLE will use reasonable efforts to notify you and to ensure that at the time of the transaction the acquirer's privacy policy complies with the Principles.\n\t\t    Children\n\t\t    The Websites are not directed at children under the age of 13. Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personal information, posts, and data from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent. Our Terms of Service specifically prohibit anyone using our Websites from submitting any personally identifiable information about persons under 13 years of age. Any person who provides their personal information, posts, and data to SimpleVLE through the Websites represents that they are 13 years of age or older.\n\t\t    Third-Party Sites\n\t\t    The Websites may include links to other websites and applications. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other websites or applications.\n\t\t    Special Note to International Users\n\t\t    The Websites are hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Websites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and other regions. By providing your personal data you consent to:\n\t\t    \n\t\t    the use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with the Privacy Policy; and\n\t\t    the transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.\n\t\t    \n\t\t    Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy\n\t\t    We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the Effective Date below.
