		    <h2 id="privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
		    <p>This Master Privacy Policy (Privacy Policy) explains the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, posts, and data by Simplistech, LLC , a Virginia LLC, with its principal place of business at Richmond, VA 23221, USA. This Privacy Policy includes products and services provided through websites that Simplistech LLC operates, which include, but are not limited to, https://simplevle.com (simplevle.com), https://www.simplevle.com (www.simplevle.com) and any subdomains of simplevle.com. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the websites operated by affiliates of SimpleVLE.</p>
		    <p>In addition, additional or supplemental Privacy Policy terms (Supplemental Privacy Policy Terms) may apply to a particular Website or service provided thereon. All such Supplemental Privacy Policy Terms will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Website or service.</p>
		    <p>This Privacy Policy also explains our commitment to you with respect to our use and disclosure of non personal browsing and site usage data that SimpleVLE collects as the provider of the Websites and a SimpleVLE service provider. That commitment is contained in a Data Usage Policy, below.</p>
		    <p>As used in this policy, personal information, posts, and data means information that would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name, address or location, telephone number or email address.</p>
		    <p>By accessing the Websites or using SimpleVLE as your SimpleVLE service provider, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		    <h3 id="our_principles">Our Principles</h3>
		    <p>SimpleVLE is committed to handling responsibly the information and data we collect about you through our Websites, whether personal information, posts, and data or non personal browsing and site usage data. We have designed our Privacy Policy and our Data Usage Policy consistent with the following principles (the Principles):</p>
		    <ol>
		    <li>Privacy policies and data collection and use policies should be human readable, comprehensive, and easy to locate;</li>
		    <li>Only the minimum amount of information reasonably necessary to provide you with services should be collected and maintained, and only for so long as reasonably needed or required;</li>
		    <li>Information you provide through our Websites, or that we gather as a result of your use of our Websites or SimpleVLE services, should not be used for marketing or advertising purposes, nor should it be provided voluntarily (without your permission) to anyone else unless required; and</li>
		    <li>Unless restricted or prohibited by law, and provided your email address has been collected and retained, you should be notified when circumstances require SimpleVLE to provide a third party with your personal information, posts, and data.</li>
		    </ol>		    
			
		    <h3 id="personal_information_SimpleVLE_collects">Personal Information SimpleVLE Collects</h3>
		    <p>We may collect personal information, posts, and data at several places on the Websites, including without limitation:</p>

		    <li>when you subscribe to one of our email lists or register to establish a user account on any of our Websites</li>
		    <li>when you sign up for an account or pay for services;</li>

		    <h3 id="what_SimpleVLE_does_with_personal_information">What SimpleVLE does with Personal Information</h3>
		    <p><strong>Emails and Newsletters.</strong> We use the personal information, posts, and data you provide to us when you send us emails or sign up to receive our newsletter or events listing in order to respond to your request for example, to reply to your email or to send you communications about news and events related to SimpleVLE. Personal information submitted as part of our email discussion lists is used for the purpose of managing the discussion lists. Your name and email address will typically be visible to other list participants when you correspond on the list and to the general public in the discussion archives. </p>
		    <p><strong>simplevle.com.</strong> When you join our network you provide personal information, posts, and data to create your account and establish a password and profile, and to create a SimpleVLE. We use that personal information, posts, and data to establish and maintain your accounts, provide you with the features we provide for account holders, to act as your SimpleVLE service provider, and for the purpose of contacting you about upcoming news and events relevant to SimpleVLE.</p>
		    <p>By joining SimpleVLE, you are given a public profile page where you can voluntarily post personal information, posts, and data for public viewing. The information that you submit on your public profile page, including but not limited to information you provide in your profile and any photograph or image of yourself you upload, is posted by you at your discretion (although subject to SimpleVLE's Terms of Service). The information you publish on your public profile page, including your personal information, posts, and data, may be used by anyone who views that information for any lawful purpose. SimpleVLE may use the personal and non personal browsing information you provide in your public profile to promote the mission of SimpleVLE. With that said, you do have the option to hide your profile from public view, however if you reply to a public post, your name and photo will be viewable to the public.</p>
		    <p><strong>Participating in Our Community:</strong> Registered Users. When you register to obtain a user account on any of the Websites (any such person, a Registered User), including but not limited to www.simplevle.com (located at https://www.simplevle.com) or SimpleVLE.com (located at http://SimpleVLE.com) you may be asked to provide personal information, posts, and data to create your account and establish a password and profile. Providing your real name is optional. If you do provide your email address, it will allow us to send you your password if you should forget it. If you voluntarily provide your real name in connection with any content you submit to any Website, your name may be associated with the content you contributed (such as when you make a post). We will also use that personal information, posts, and data to establish and maintain your membership and provide you with the features we provide for Registered Users, and for the purpose of contacting you about upcoming news and events relevant to SimpleVLE.</p>
		    <p>Registered Users on the simplevle.com and SimpleVLE.is Websites are automatically provided with an application where you may post personal information, posts, and data for public and restricted viewing. You are not required to post any information or personal information, posts, and data on this application, but may be posted in your own sole discretion (although any information posted remains subject to SimpleVLE's Terms of Service). Please note that the information you publish on your public profile and posts, including your personal information, posts, and data, may be used by anyone who views that information for any lawful purpose and, where relevant, subject to license terms set forth in SimpleVLE's Terms of Service. SimpleVLE may use the personal and non personal browsing information you provide on your public page to promote the mission of SimpleVLE and the OpenEd Website. If provided, your name may be associated with content you contribute to the OpenEd Website.</p>
		    <p>Any other personal information, posts, and data that we may collect which is not described specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected and used in accordance with the Principles.</p>
		    <h3 id="disclosures_of_personal_information">Disclosures of Personal Information</h3>
		    <p>In general, it is not SimpleVLE's practice to disclose personal information, posts, and data to third parties. We may share personal information, posts, and data in two instances:</p>
		    <p>First, SimpleVLE may share personal information, posts, and data with our contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Websites or the educational service.</p>
		    <p>Second, we may disclose your personal information, posts, and data to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy; <span>(c)</span> comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public.</p>
		    <p>If SimpleVLE is required to provide a third party with your personal information, posts, and data (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then provided we have collected and retained an email address for you, SimpleVLE will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless prohibited by law or SimpleVLE is otherwise advised not to notify you on the advice of legal counsel.</p>
		    <h3 id="security_of_personal_information_collected_via_the_websites_simplevle">Security of Personal Information Collected via the Websites; SimpleVLE</h3>
		    <p>SimpleVLE has implemented reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of personal information, posts, and data that SimpleVLE stores and controls. However, no website can fully eliminate security risks. Third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We will post a reasonably prominent notice to the Websites if any such security breach occurs.</p>
		    <h3 id="data_usage_policy_non_personal_browsing_and_site_usage_information">Data Usage Policy: Non Personal Browsing and Site Usage Information</h3>
		    <p>Our Data Usage Policy covers how we maintain and use information about you that is collected by our Websites and server logs, including when you log into a website using your SimpleVLE account.</p>
		    <p><strong>Non Personal Browsing Information We Collect.</strong> When you use the Websites, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of your IP address) about your activities while visiting the Websites and information about the browser you are using. In addition, whenever you use your SimpleVLE SimpleVLE to log into a website, our servers (which, again, may be hosted by a third party service provider) keep a log of the websites you visit and when you visit them.</p>
		    <p><strong>No Linking.</strong> We do not intentionally link browsing information or information from our SimpleVLE server logs to the personal information, posts, and data you submit to us. We use this information for internal purposes only, such as to help understand how the Websites are being used, to improve our Websites and the features we provide, and for systems administration purposes. SimpleVLE may use a third party analytics provider to help us collect and analyze non personal browsing information through operation of our Websites for those same purposes; however, we will never use a third party analytics provider to collect or analyze any information through our operations as a SimpleVLE service provider.</p>
		    <p><strong>No Selling or Sharing.</strong> Except in the unique situations identified in this Privacy Policy, SimpleVLE does not sell or otherwise voluntarily provide the non personal browsing information we collect about you or your website usage to third parties.</p>
		    <p><strong>No Access.</strong> As a SimpleVLE service provider, SimpleVLE could technically access your web-based account tied to our SimpleVLE service, and could log in on behalf of any of its SimpleVLE users to any of the accounts they have accessed using their SimpleVLE SimpleVLE. SimpleVLE will never use this technical login ability for any purpose unless otherwise required by law.</p>
		    <p><strong>No Retention.</strong> SimpleVLE discards non personal browsing information from our SimpleVLE server logs once we have used the information for the limited purposes noted above, under No Linking.</p>
		    <p><strong>Notice.</strong> If SimpleVLE is required to provide a third party with your non personal browsing information or to log in on behalf of a SimpleVLE user (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then SimpleVLE will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless SimpleVLE is prohibited by law from doing so or is otherwise advised not to notify you on the advice of legal counsel.</p>
		    <p>Any other non-personal information, posts, and data that we collect which is not described specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected and used in accordance with the Principles.</p>
