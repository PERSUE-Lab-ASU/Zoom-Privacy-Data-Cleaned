                                <p>We collect different types of information from or through the Service. The legal
                                    bases for JustCall's processing of Personal Data are primarily that the processing
                                    is necessary for providing the Service in accordance with our Terms of Service and
                                    that the processing is carried out in JustCall's legitimate interests, which are
                                    further explained in the section “How do we use your information?” of this Policy.
                                    We may also process data upon your consent, asking for it as appropriate.</p>

                                    collect Personal Data. Examples of Personal Data include name, email address, mobile
                                    phone number, and credit card or other billing information. Personal Data also
                                    includes other information, such as geographic area or preferences, when any such
                                    information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual. You may
                                    provide us with Personal Data in various ways on the Service. For example, when you
                                    register for an Account, use the Service, post Client Data, interact with other
                                    users of the Service through communication or messaging capabilities, or send us

                                    described in this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>

                                <p>The Service is hosted in the United States if you choose to use the service from the EU or

                                    differ from US law, then please note that you may be transferring your Client Data

                                    processed by a Client or User via the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled
                                    to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. JustCall is largely
                                    unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client
                                    or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as

                                <p>Because JustCall does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained

                                    fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise
                                    required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our

                                <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the

                                    development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
                                    Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
