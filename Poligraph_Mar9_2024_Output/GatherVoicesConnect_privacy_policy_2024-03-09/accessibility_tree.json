As between You and GV and Sponsor, You have sole responsibility and liability for Your User Content and for ensuring that it does not violate GV\u2019s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) set forth in Section 4.3.2 below or otherwise violate the legal rights of any third party.

Neither GV nor Sponsor shall have any obligation or responsibility to review, filter or edit User Content, but they shall have the right to do so if they choose. For purposes of defamation and other laws, neither GV nor Sponsor is the publisher of User Content. 3.3 User Content of Others. User Content does not necessarily reflect the views of GV or Sponsor, nor should GV or Sponsor be viewed as endorsing any User Content in any way. User Content uploaded or viewable through the Service by You or others, is provided by users like You who are unaffiliated with GV or Sponsor, and the user providing User Content is solely responsible for his/her own User Content. It is possible that the Service may contain User Content of others that violates the AUP, is offensive or objectionable, contains errors, violates intellectual property, privacy, publicity or other rights of third parties, or is harmful to Your Devices, computers or networks. Your use of the Service or any User Content of others is entirely at Your own risk, and GV and Sponsor disclaim any and all representations, warranties and liability with respect to User Content. Neither GV nor Sponsor, or their respective Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, and employees, are responsible for any User Content, the accuracy or opinions expressed on the Service, nor shall they have any liability for any User Content. You are responsible for implementing safeguards and taking precautions necessary to protect Yourself and others, and Your Devices, computers and network from any possible harm resulting from access to User Content. 3.4 No Compensation for User Content. GV, its licensees, Affiliates, successors and assigns, will be entitled to retain any and all revenue generated from any sales, licenses, assignments and other transfers of the rights granted by You hereunder, as well as any and all revenue generated by the display of any advertising, publicity, promotional materials or distribution rights in connection with Your User Content. Nothing in this Agreement obligates GV or any other person or entity to exercise any of the rights granted by You under this Agreement. You will not receive any compensation of any kind for Your User Content or its use, regardless of any industry practice or custom. Neither GV nor Sponsor, nor their respective Affiliates, successors and/or assigns, shall have any obligation to give You credit or attribution for Your User Content, but in their sole discretion may choose to do so. 3.5 User Content Cannot be Deleted, is Not Confidential, and is Non-Returnable. Uploading any of Your User Content to the Service is completely voluntary. However, subject to Section 3.7 (Request That User Content No Longer Be Made Publicly Accessible), even if you delete Your account on the Service, You may not you edit or delete any User Content once it has been submitted to the Service. GV and/or Sponsor may retain your User Content to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and as described in this Agreement and in Sponsor\u2019s Terms of Service. GV and/or Sponsor may also discard your User Content at their respective discretion and will have no obligation to notify you or provide you with a duplicate copy; therefore, you should retain your own records of any content or other information that you submit to GV or Sponsor through use of the Service or otherwise. 3.6 Sponsor and/or GV shall have sole discretion as to the disposition of Your User Content, including whether Your User Content will be used, stored, deleted, modified, made publicly viewable on Sponsor\u2019s website or on the Service, or otherwise, subject to applicable laws, and You agree that You shall no longer have any control over Your User Content. You should have no expectation of confidentiality with regard to Your User Content, as it will not be held in confidence, and uploading User Content does not create any fiduciary or confidential relationship or obligation to You with or on the part of GV or Sponsor. Neither GV nor Sponsor shall have any obligation to You, either during the term of this Agreement or afterwards, to preserve, maintain, store, delete or make Your User Content available to You, and may delete or destroy, at any time, Your User Content and all copies on the Service, their respective systems or otherwise in their respective possession or control, except to the extent prohibited by law. 3.7 Request That User Content No Longer Be Made Publicly Accessible. If you have a good faith reasonable belief that any of Your User Content violates the AUP or is otherwise in violation of applicable law, and You therefore wish that it no longer be accessible through the Service, You must contact Sponsor directly in writing and describe in detail the nature of the User Content, the approximate date(s) on which it was uploaded, the nature of your concerns and why you believe they justify removal of the User Content from the Service.
