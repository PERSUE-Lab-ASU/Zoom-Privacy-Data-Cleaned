<p>Our platform consists of various software components, services and mobile applications (collectively, the “Service”), which may be accessed directly or through our Customers’ websites or through links provided by our Customers. Our Customers are the organizations that have arranged with GV to make the Service available to you under their auspices or sponsorship. They are referred to as “Sponsors” in GV’s <a href="#GVT">Terms of Service and End User License Agreement</a> (the “GV User Agreement”) which applies to your use of our Service, but in this Privacy Policy we refer to them as our “Customers,” and sometimes as your “Sponsor” for clarity. The term “you” or “your” means you, personally, or the company or organization on whose behalf you are using the Service. The term “Site” refers individually or collectively to our websites at <a href="http://www.gathervoices.co">www.gathervoices.co</a> and <a href="http://www.gv-one.com">www.gv-one.com</a> and any other website operated by GV which links to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes the steps we take to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Data, User Content and other information we gather, receive, store and/or process, either on our own behalf or on behalf of our Customers who use our Service. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your Personal Data. We periodically update this Privacy Policy, so we encourage you to check this site and review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

<p>If you are an individual user of the Service or a Customer, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between (a) the GV User Agreement applicable to individual users, and this Privacy Policy, and (b) between the GV Subscription Agreement applicable to Customers, and this Privacy Policy, the GV User Agreement and GV Subscription Agreement, as applicable, shall govern to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<p>If you are under the age of 18 in the United States, under 16 in the European Union or under the age of majority in your country of residence, you are not permitted to use our Site without parental consent. For more information, please see the “Children’s Privacy” section below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:80px">When you register for an account to use the Service, either on your own behalf directly with us or through one of our Customers’ websites or mobile apps, or as an employee of our Customer instructed to establish an account on behalf of our Customer (which will also require execution of GV’s Terms of Service Agreement), you will be asked to provide Basic Personal Data as described above. (In certain cases, if you are an employee of one of our Customers (your “Sponsor,” the organization that introduced you to our Service), the GV Subscription Agreement will address the obligations that can be imposed on their employees, and additional or different terms may apply.

		<li><strong>The right to be informed regarding the collection and use of your Personal Data.</strong> This Privacy Policy serves that purpose. You should also review the Privacy Policies of any data controllers – including our Customers – to which you may have provided your Personal Data.</li>
		<li><strong>The right of access.</strong> You have the right to access the Personal Data that has been collected concerning you, and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing.</li>
		<li><strong>The right to rectification.</strong> You have the right to obtain from the data controller (which may be a GV Customer), without undue delay, the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Considering the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed.</li>
		<li><strong>The right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”).</strong> In certain circumstances, you may have a broader right to erasure of Personal Data that we hold about you – for example, if it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions, or to comply with our legal obligations.&nbsp;</li>
		<li><strong>The right to restrict processing.</strong> You may have the right to request that we restrict processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances (for example, where you believe that the Personal Data we hold about you is inaccurate or unlawfully held).</li>
		<li><strong>The right to data portability.</strong> In certain circumstances, you may have the right to be provided with your Personal Data in a structured, machine readable and commonly used format and to request that we transfer the Personal Data to another data controller without hindrance.</li>
		<li><strong>The right to object to processing.</strong> You may have the right to request that GV stop processing your Personal Data and/or to stop sending you marketing communications.</li>
		<li><strong>Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling<a name="_ftnref5"></a>.</strong> You may have the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects that affect you.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Legal Bas</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s for Processing.</strong> We will collect or process your Personal Data only when we have a legal basis for doing so, which depends on how you interact with GV and/or our Service, or the systems or services of one of our Customers (acting as a data controller) on whose behalf we act as a data processor. This means that we will normally collect, process and/or use (depending on the context) your Personal Data only where:&nbsp;
	<ul style="list-style-type:square">
		<li>It is supplied to us by you, or by one of our Customers acting as a data controller, and you have consented to the processing of your Personal Data for one or more specific purposes. Note that where your Personal Data is contained within the data sent to us for processing by our Customer, you will normally already have provided your consent to that Customer.</li>
		<li>It is necessary to provide and operate our Service, including providing support and personalized features, or to protect the safety and security of our Service or Customers and their data.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>It is necessary in the context of performing our obligations under a contract, e.g., to provide our Service to a Customer.</li>
		<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as research and development, marketing and promotion of our Service, fraud prevention, and to protect our or our Customers’ legal rights and interests.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>You provide us, or our Customer, with your consent to do so for a specific purpose.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>It is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which our Customer (as the data controller) is subject.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:80px">If you have consented to our, or our Customer’s, use of your Personal Data for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time and object to that use, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. This may mean, however, that you may no longer be able to use or benefit from our Service or those provided by our Customer, as applicable.</p>

<p>Except to the extent prohibited by law, and subject to this Privacy Policy (and the GV Agreement if you are a Customer), we will retain and use Personal Data for a period of time consistent with the original purpose for which it was provided or collected, e.g., as needed to provide you the Service, to document our business relationship with you, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, and for a reasonable period of time thereafter. The foregoing does not apply to any Personal Data included in User Content, e.g., contained within a video uploaded to our Service – our Customer exclusively controls the disposition of that data and we will retain data in accordance with their instructions.</p>

<p><a name="Howdoweprotect"><strong>10. How We Protect Your Information.</strong></a></p>

<p>GV uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (256-AES) to encrypt data in transit. We also implement industry-standard security procedures and processes to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Data, User Content and our Customers’ data transmitted, stored and processed using our Service. Our physical security layer is protected by need-to-know authorization provided only to the appropriate operations individuals. Our network is also protected by industry-standard firewall technology and administered real-time to provide timely security patching. This layer is also monitored by intrusion-detection systems designed to detect unauthorized access.</p>

<p>These safeguards are intended to protect User Content and Personal Data and to ensure, to the extent possible, the proper and legal use of the Site and our Service. However, no data security system is impenetrable, and GV cannot and does not guarantee that information stored, processed or transmitted using our Service will be 100% secure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="Changes"><strong>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy.</strong> </a></p>

<p>For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on the Site that link to other websites not under the control of GV.

<p><a name="ChildrensPrivacy"><strong>13. Children's Privacy</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

In the U.S., children under 13 years old are prohibited from using our Service without verified parental consent. If you are under the age of eighteen (18) in the US, you represent that a parent or legal guardian also agrees to this policy on your behalf.&nbsp;For individual data subjects entitled to the protections of the GDPR, parental consent may be required for persons under 13 to 16 years old, depending on the age set by the applicable EU member state. We do not knowingly allow persons below these ages to use our Service without their parent’s consent.

Please see the “<a href="#ContactingGV">Contacting GV</a>” section below. Parents: please caution your children not to send us any Personal Data without your verifiable consent. Consistent with the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and Rules</a>, if a child under 13 has provided Personal Data to us through the Service without verifiable parental consent, a parent or guardian may inform us using the information in the “<a href="#ContactingGV">Contacting GV</a>” section below, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information, subject to applicable law and this Privacy Policy.
