<p>As part of a global group of companies operating internationally, Litmos has affiliates and third-party service providers outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or from a region with a legal restriction on international data transfers and will transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the EEA. If these transfers are to a country for which the EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, Litmos uses the EU standard contractual clauses to contractually require that your Personal Data receives a level of data protection consistent with the EEA. You can obtain a copy (redacted to remove commercial or irrelevant) of such standard contractual clauses by sending a request to privacy@litmos.com. You can also obtain more information from the European Commission on the international dimension of data protection here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_fr">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_fr</a></p>
<p><strong>What are your data protection rights?</strong></p>
<p>You can request from Litmos: access at any time to information about which Personal Data Litmos processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Data.</p>
<p>If Litmos uses your Personal Data based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you can further request from Litmos a copy of the Personal Data that you have provided to Litmos. In this case, please contact privacy@litmos.com and specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates, the format in which you would like to receive this information, and whether the Personal Data should be sent to you or another recipient. Litmos will carefully consider your request and discuss with you how it can best fulfill it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can request from Litmos that Litmos restricts your Personal Data from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the Personal Data Litmos has about you is incorrect, subject to the time Litmos requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Data, (ii) there is no legal basis for Litmos processing your Personal Data and you demand that Litmos restricts your Personal Data from further processing, (iii) Litmos no longer requires your Personal Data but you state that you require Litmos to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims, or (iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Data by Litmos based on Litmos’s legitimate interest (as further set out below), subject to the time required for Litmos to determine whether it has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Data.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that Litmos can or will delete your Personal Data only if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of Litmos to retain it. Kindly note further that if you request that Litmos deletes your Personal Data, you will not be able to continue to use any Litmos service that requires Litmos’s use of your Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>How can you exercise your data protection rights?</strong></p>
<p>Please direct any requests to exercise your rights to privacy@litmos.com.</p>
<p><strong>How will Litmos verify requests to exercise data protection rights?</strong></p>
<p>Litmos will take steps to ensure that it verifies your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty before it will process the data protection right you want to exercise. When feasible, Litmos will match Personal Data provided by you in submitting a request to exercise your rights with information already maintained by Litmos. This could include matching two or more data points you provide when you submit a request with two or more data points that are already maintained by Litmos.</p>
<p>Litmos will decline to process requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive, fraudulent, or are not otherwise required by local law.</p>
<p><u>Right to lodge a complaint.</u> If you take the view that Litmos is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements in this Privacy Statement or under applicable data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country where you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state where Litmos has its registered seat.</p>
<p><strong>Can you use Litmos’s Site if you are a minor?</strong><br>
<strong>Children.</strong> In general, the Site is not directed to users below the age of 16 years, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction. If you are younger than 16, or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, you cannot register with or use the Site.</p>
<p><strong>B. Processing based on a statutory permission</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why does Litmos need to use my Personal Data and on what legal basis is Litmos using it?</strong></p>
<p><u>Processing to fulfill contractual obligation</u></p>
<p>Litmos requires your Personal Data to deliver goods or services you order under a contract Litmos has with you, to establish a contract for goods or services between you and Litmos, and to send you invoices for ordered goods or services.</p>
<p>Additionally, Litmos requires your Personal Data to provide you, at your request, with access to Litmos events or Litmos materials such as whitepapers. Litmos processes Personal Data to fulfill contractual obligations pursuant to Article 6(1), Subparagraph 1(b) GDPR, or the equivalent article under other national laws, when applicable.</p>
<p><u>Processing to ensure compliance</u></p>
<p>Litmos and its products, technologies, and services are subject to the export laws of various countries including, without limitation, those of the European Union and its member states, and of the United States of America. You acknowledge that, pursuant to the applicable export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes issued by these countries, Litmos is required to take measures to prevent entities, organizations, and parties listed on government-issued sanctioned-party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through Litmos’s websites or other delivery channels controlled by Litmos. This could include (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out herein and other information a user provides about his or her identity against applicable sanctioned-party lists; (ii) regular repetition of such checks whenever a sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her information; (iii) blocking of access to Litmos’s services and systems in case of a potential match; and (iv) contacting a user to confirm his or her identity in case of a potential match. Any such use of your Personal Data is based on the permission to process Personal Data in order to comply with statutory obligations (Article 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR or the equivalent articles under other national laws, when applicable) and Litmos ‘s legitimate interest (Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or the equivalent articles under other national laws, when applicable).</p>
<p><u>Processing based on Litmos’s legitimate interest </u></p>
<p>Litmos can use your Personal Data based on its legitimate interest (Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or the equivalent articles under other national laws, when applicable) as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Fraud and Legal Claims.</strong> If required, Litmos will use your Personal Data for the purposes of preventing or prosecuting criminal activities such as fraud and to assert or defend against legal claims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Questionnaires and survey.</strong> Litmos could invite you to participate in questionnaires and surveys. These questionnaires and surveys will be generally designed in a way that they can be answered without any data that can be used to identify you.

<ul>
<li><strong>Contract Performance.</strong> If you purchase or intend to purchase goods or services from Litmos on behalf of a corporate customer or otherwise be the nominated contact person for the business relationship between a corporate customer (a “Customer Contact”) and Litmos, Litmos will use your Personal Data for this purpose. This includes, for the avoidance of doubt, such steps which are required for establishing the relevant business relationship. In case that an existing Customer Contact informs Litmos that you are his replacement, Litmos will, from the point in time of such notification, consider you to be the relevant Customer Contact for the respective customer until you object as further set out below.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personalized Newsletter.</strong> If you opt-in to receive marketing communications such as newsletters from Litmos, Litmos will collect and store details of how you interact with the newsletters to help create, develop, operate, deliver and improve our newsletter communications with you. This information is aggregated and used to help Litmos provide more useful information and to understand what is of most interest.</li>
<li><strong>Recordings for quality improvement purposes.</strong> In case of telephone calls or chat sessions, Litmos will record such calls (after informing you accordingly during that call and before the recording starts) or chat sessions in order to improve the quality of Litmos’s services.</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>To keep you up-to-date or request feedback.</strong> Within an existing business relationship between you and Litmos, Litmos might inform you, where permitted in accordance with local laws, about its products or services (including webinars, seminars or events) which are similar or relate to such products and services you have already purchased or used from Litmos. Furthermore, where you have attended a webinar, seminar or event of Litmos or purchased products or services from Litmos, Litmos might contact you for feedback regarding the improvement of the relevant webinar, seminar, event, product or service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right to Object</strong></p>
<p>You can at any time object to Litmos’s use of your Personal Data as set forth in this section by sending an email to privacy@litmos.com. In this case, Litmos will carefully review your objection and cease further use of the relevant information, subject to Litmos’s compelling legitimate grounds for continued use of the information, which override your interest in objecting, or if Litmos requires the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p><strong>C. Cookies and Similar Tools</strong></p>
<p>Information gathered by cookies or similar technologies, and any use of such information, is further described in Litmos’s <a href="https://www.litmos.com/cookie-statement">Cookie Statement</a>. You can exercise your cookie preferences as outlined in Litmos’s Cookie Statement by visiting the “Cookie Preferences” link in the bottom footer of the homepage.</p>
<p><strong>D. Additional Country and Regional Specific Provisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where Litmos is subject to certain privacy requirements in the United States, the following also applies:</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Children’s Privacy. Litmos does not knowingly collect the Personal Data of children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe Litmos collected information about a child, please contact Litmos as described in this Privacy Statement. Litmos will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Given that Litmos is not directed to users under 16 years of age and in accordance with the disclosure requirements of the CCPA, Litmos does not sell the Personal Data of any minors under 16 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>Where Litmos is subject to certain privacy requirements in the United States in the State of California, the following also applies:</strong></p>
<p><u>You have the right:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>to request from Litmos access to your Personal Data that Litmos collects, uses, or discloses about you;</li>
<li>to request that Litmos delete Personal Data about you;</li>
<li>to non-discriminatory treatment for exercise of any of your data protection rights; and</li>
<li>in case of request from Litmos for access to your Personal Data, for such information to be portable, if possible, in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit this information to another recipient without hindrance.</li>
</ul>
<p>In accordance with the disclosure requirements under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Litmos does not and will not sell your Personal Data.</p>
<p>In accordance with the verification process set forth in the CCPA, Litmos will require a more stringent verification process for deletion requests, or for Personal Data that is considered sensitive or valuable, to minimize the harm that might be posed to you by unauthorized access or deletion of your Personal Data. If Litmos must request additional information from you outside of information that is already maintained by Litmos, Litmos will only use it to verify your identity so you can exercise your data protection rights, or for security and fraud-prevention purposes.</p>
<p>In addition to contacting Litmos at privacy@litmos.com, you may also exercise your rights as follows. You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise your data protection rights to Litmos. Such authorized agent must be registered with the California Secretary of State and submit proof that you have given authorization for the agent to act on your behalf.</p>
