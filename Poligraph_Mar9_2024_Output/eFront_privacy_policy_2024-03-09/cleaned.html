<p style="margin-top:0">eFront: eFront is a highly customizable robust Learning Management System (LMS) for enterprises, with unrivaled ease and flexibility, to fit all brand specifications and train masses of employees, partners and customers. eFront is highly secure and can be either hosted in a cloud environment (at a datacenter of a major cloud provider selected by the Customer) or deployed within an organization’s intranet. Each Customer administers and manages his own dedicated eFront service instance. Customers can enroll their users and sign them up to the courses (“Learners”) created by their Instructors, and customize their LMS by means of specifying custom user roles with certain permissions; using gamification elements; performing a logical separation of their domain into a flat list or a nested hierarchy of different logical units-departments (‘Branches’), each with its own courses, learners, instructors and branding (sub-domain, theme, logo) etc. Designed to be the industry’s most adaptable enterprise LMS, eFront gives its Customers complete control over their virtual training environment and data. eFront blends seamlessly with any other infrastructure and has the power to grow as the Customer’s needs grow.</p>
