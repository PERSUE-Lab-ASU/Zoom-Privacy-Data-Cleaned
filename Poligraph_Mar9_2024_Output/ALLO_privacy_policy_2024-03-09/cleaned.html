<p>Effective as of June 4, 2021.</p>
<p>This “Privacy Policy” describes the privacy practices of BeeCanvas, Inc. and its corporate affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Allo”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) in connection with the (i) <a href="http://www.allo.io">www.allo.io</a> website; (ii) the Allo mobile application; (iii) any other website or mobile application that we own or control and which posts or links to this Privacy Policy; and (iv) the online whiteboard designed to facilitate visual collaboration (the Platform), (collectively, the “Service”).  This Privacy Policy also describes the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to their information.  Allo may provide additional or supplemental privacy policies to individuals for specific products or services that we offer at the time we collect personal information. These supplemental privacy policies will govern how we may process the information in the context of the specific product or service.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the personal information we process as a data controller, that is, as the party that determines what personal information to collect and for what purposes. You provide some of this information directly, and we get some of it by collecting information about your interactions, use, and experiences with the Service as further explained in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>On the Platform and if you use it through a Allo enterprise customer, Allo processes visual collaboration and other information on our enterprise customers’ behalf.  Our customers are considered data controllers and when we process information on their behalf, it is in accordance with their instructions.  If you are a user of the Allo Platform through an enterprise customer, the relevant customer’s privacy policy and the agreement between the customer and Allo govern the processing of your personal information.  For more information, please contact the relevant customer.</p>
<p>The Service is designed for businesses and is not intended for personal or household use.  Accordingly, we treat all personal information covered by this Privacy Policy, including information about any visitors to our website, as pertaining to individuals acting as business representatives rather than in their personal capacity.</p>
<p>We provide important information for individuals located in the European Union, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:European_Economic_Area_(EEA)">European Economic Area</a>), Switzerland and United Kingdom (collectively, “Europe” or “European”) <a href="#notice-to-european-users">below</a>.</p>

<h2 id="your-choices">Your Choices</h2>
<p>In this section, we describe the rights and choices available to all users. Users who are located within Europe can find additional information about their rights <a href="#notice-to-european-users">below</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Access or Update Your Information.</strong> If you have registered for an account with us, you may review and update certain personal information in your account profile by logging into the account.</p>
<p><strong>Opt out of marketing communications.</strong>  You may opt out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@beecanvas.com">privacy@beecanvas.com</a>.  You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Browser Web Storage.</strong>  We may allow service providers and other third parties to use cookies and similar technologies to track your browsing activity over time and across the Service and third party websites. For more details, see our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted online advertising.</strong> Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities on or through the Service may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.</p>
<p>Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">here</a> or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">here</a>. European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>, selecting the user’s country, and then clicking “Choices” (or similarly titled link). Users of our mobile applications may opt out of receiving targeted advertising in mobile apps through participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by installing the AppChoices mobile app, available <a href="https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices">here</a>, and selecting the user’s choices. Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above.</p>
<p>In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit our, or our partners’, ability to engage in ad tracking or targeted advertising using the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising associated with your mobile device.</p>
<p>If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track.</strong>  Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit.  We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” or similar signals.  To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing not to share your personal information.</strong> Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your personal information in order to provide the Service to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or you later ask to delete it), we may not be able to provide you with our services.  We will tell you what information you must provide to receive the Service by designating it as required at the time of collection or through other appropriate means.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party platforms or social media networks.</strong> If you choose to connect to the Service via a third-party platform or social media network, you may have the ability to limit the information that we may obtain from the third-party at the time you login to the Service using the third-party’s authentication service or otherwise connect your account. Subsequently, you may be able to control your settings through the third-party’s platform or service. For example, you may access and change your settings through the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications">settings page</a> for Apps and Websites. If you withdraw our ability to access certain information from a third-party platform or social media network, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third-party.</p>

Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and mobile applications and online services you use.</p>
<h2 id="security-practices">Security Practices</h2>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  We employ a number of organizational, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect.  However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.</p>
<h2 id="international-data-transfers">International Data Transfers</h2>

<p><strong>Use for new purposes.</strong> We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it.  If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive personal information.</strong>  We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Service, or otherwise to us.</p>
<p>If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Service, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Retention</strong></p>
<p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.  If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>Your rights</strong></p>
<p>European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information.  If you are located within Europe, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:</p>

<li><strong>Object.</strong>  Object to our reliance on our legitimate interests as the basis of our processing of your personal information that impacts your rights.</li>
