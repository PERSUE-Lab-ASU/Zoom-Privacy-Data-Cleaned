Cookies are text files which users of a visited website receive and which can be used to identify you to this website.</p><p>Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string of characters through which web pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the person concerned from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A particular Internet browser can be recognized and identified by its unique cookie ID.</p><p>By using cookies, the responsible person can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services, which would not be possible without the setting of cookies.</p><p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimised in the interests of the user. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website.</p><p>The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. In addition, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs used. This is possible in all common Internet browsers. By deactivating cookies, it may happen that some functions of our website are no longer fully usable.</p><h2 id="privacy-statement-toc-9">§ 9 Collecting data using server log files</h2><p>On our website, a series of general data is collected each time a person concerned or an automated system accesses our website. These general data are collected anonymously and stored in the log files of the server. We record (a) the browser types and versions used, (b) the operating system used by the accessing system, (c) the website from which an accessing system accesses our website (so-called referrer), (d) the sub-sites which are accessed via an accessing system on our website, (e) the date and time of an access to the website, (f) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (g) the Internet service provider of the accessing system and (h) other similar data used to avert danger in the event of attacks on our IT systems.</p><p>The data collected is anonymised after seven days. Due to the anonymisation, the person responsible cannot draw any conclusions about the person concerned. This data is rather required to (a) correctly deliver the contents of our website, (b) optimise the contents of our website and the advertising for it, (c) guarantee the permanent functionality of our IT systems and the technology of our website and (d) provide law enforcement authorities with the data necessary for criminal prosecution in the event of a cyber attack. This anonymously collected data is therefore evaluated by the responsible person both statistically and with the aim of increasing data protection and data security in our institution. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by the person concerned.</p><h2 id="privacy-statement-toc-10">§ 10 Contact details of the provider</h2><p>Due to legal regulations, our website contains information that enables us to be contacted quickly and electronically and to communicate directly with you, including a general e-mail address.

Matomo is an open source software tool for usage analysis. Usage analysis is the collection and analysis of data about user behavior on applications. In the web the tool records from which website the user has accessed this website, which subpages have been accessed and how often and how long subpages have been viewed by the user. In a mobile app the tool  records time spent in the application and user interactions. This analysis is used to optimize the application.</p><p>The software is operated on the server of the responsible person. All log files are stored exclusively on this server.</p><p>The legal basis for processing data is the legitimate interest of the controller to  optimise and evaluate the use of the application (Art. 6 par. 1 (f) GDPR). A weighing of interests of the controller and of the data subject has been carried out.</p><p>Matomo places a cookie on the IT system of the user concerned. The cookie enables the analysis of usage. Each time one of the individual pages is called up, the Internet browser on the IT system of the person concerned is automatically prompted to transmit data to our server for the purpose of online analysis. In this process, we obtain knowledge of the IP address of the person concerned, which serves, among other things, to trace the origin of the visitors. In addition to the IP address, the access time, location from which the access originated and the frequency of visits to our website are stored. The IP address is made anonymous immediately upon collection.</p><p>By adjusting the settings of the Internet browser used, the setting of cookies by Matomo can be permanently rejected. In addition, set cookies can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software. Furthermore, it is possible to object to the recording of the use by Matomo. The person concerned must set an opt-out cookie for this purpose. If the cookie settings of the Internet browser used are reset, this cookie would have to be set again.</p><p>The setting of the opt-out cookie may lead to restrictions in the functionality of the website.</p><p>Further information and Matomo's current data protection regulations can be found at <a href="https://matomo.org/privacy/" target="_blank">https://matomo.org/privacy/</a> abgerufen werden.</p><p><iframe title="Opt-out function for tracking by Matomo" style="border: 0; height: 200px; width: 100%;" src="https://stats.descript.de/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&amp;action=optOut&amp;language=en&amp;backgroundColor=&amp;fontColor=&amp;fontSize=1rem&amp;fontFamily=Open%20Sans"></iframe></p><h2 id="privacy-statement-toc-13">§ 13 Privacy Policy on the Use and Usage of YouTube</h2><p>The responsible person has integrated components of YouTube on this website.

This information is collected by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the person concerned.</p><p>YouTube and Google receive information via the YouTube component that the person concerned has visited our website if the person concerned is logged on to YouTube at the same time as the video is being played. If YouTube and Google do not want the data subject to submit this information to YouTube and Google in this way, the data subject may prevent the submission by logging out of his/her YouTube account before accessing our website.</p><p>The data protection regulations published by YouTube, which are available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/update?hl=en" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy/update?hl=en</a> , provide information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.</p><h2 id="privacy-statement-toc-14">§ 14 Troubleshooting</h2><p>In order to be able to analyse and correct errors that have occurred on our website, monitoring is carried out.
