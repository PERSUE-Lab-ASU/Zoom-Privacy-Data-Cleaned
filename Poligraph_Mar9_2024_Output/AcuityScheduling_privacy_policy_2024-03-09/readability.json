When it comes to your personal information, we believe in transparency, not surprises. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve set out here what personal information we collect, what we do with it and your choices and rights.</p><p>By using any of Squarespace\u2019s Services, you confirm you have agreed to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/terms-of-service\">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;and read and understood this Privacy Policy and our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/cookie-policy\">Cookie Policy</a>.</p><p>Certain jurisdictions require us to provide you with specific additional information. Please see <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/privacy-specific\">this page</a> for such additional information if you are in: (I) California; or (II) Virginia,&nbsp;Colorado, Connecticut or Utah.</p><p><strong>1. Some key terms</strong></p><p>In our Privacy Policy, when we refer to \u201cUsers\u201d, we mean our customers who use our Services, including visitors to our sites. We explain who we are in the \u201cWho is Squarespace?\u201d section below.&nbsp;The users, visitors and customers of our Users\u2019 sites are \u201cEnd Users\u201d. Any other capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/terms-of-service\">Terms of Service</a>.</p><p><strong>2. How does this Privacy Policy apply?</strong></p><p>This Privacy Policy describes what we do with personal information that we collect and use for our own purposes (i.e., where we are a controller), such as your account information and information about how you use and interact with our Services, including information you submit to our customer support as well as certain information relating to your End Users, such as, if applicable, End User information provided to the Squarespace Payments Services (as defined in the <a href=\"http://www.squarespace.com/payments-terms\">Squarespace Payments Terms</a>). This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information of our employees or job applicants (except to the extent employees or job applicants are Users). This Privacy Policy also includes the right to object to certain types of processing we carry out (see Section 7 below to find out more).</p><p>We use cookies and similar technologies. Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/cookie-policy\">Cookie Policy</a>&nbsp;describes what we do in that regard.</p><p>With respect to personal information in Squarespace\u2019s possession, we play a few different roles under global data privacy laws. In order to understand your and Squarespace\u2019s obligations, it\u2019s important to understand the difference between Squarespace Controlled PI and User Controlled PI.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p>\u201cSquarespace Controlled PI\u201d means personal information for which Squarespace determines the purposes and means of processing. This Privacy Policy and<a href=\"http://squarespace.com/privacy-specific\"> this additional U.S. state information page</a> only address Squarespace Controlled PI.</p></li><li><p>\u201cUser Controlled PI\u201d means personal information for which a User determines the purposes and means of processing. For User Controlled PI, Squarespace acts as a data processor, service provider or similar term under applicable law. User Controlled PI includes User Content and End Users' personal information described in Section 12 that we host and process on behalf of our Users. Our Users tell us what we do with User Controlled PI on our Users\u2019 instructions. Our Users are responsible for ensuring that their collection and processing of User Controlled PI complies with applicable law. If you are a User looking for contractual provisions about how Squarespace will treat and secure your User Controlled PI, please see our <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/dpa\">Data Processing Addendum</a>.</p></li></ul><p>We explain below how we collect and use Squarespace Controlled PI and your rights. If you are an End User of one of our User\u2019s sites and want to know how a User handles your information, you should check the site's privacy policy.</p><p><strong>3. Personal information we collect</strong></p><p>We collect various personal information regarding you or your device. This includes the following:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p>Information you provide to create an Account, specifically email address, first name and last name.</p></li><li><p>Information you provide if you sign up for Paid Services. For most Paid Services, this will include your billing address as well as a portion of your payment information which is provided to us from our payment processor (such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date of the payment card).</p></li><li><p>The emails and other communications that you send us or otherwise contribute, such as customer support inquiries or posts to our customer message boards or forums. Please be aware that information on public parts of our sites is available to others.</p></li><li><p>If you use the Squarespace Payments Services through the Services, in accordance with the Squarespace Payments Terms, additional information to set up, manage and provide the Squarespace Payments Services and integrate them with the Processor Services (as defined in the Squarespace Payments Terms), including information about you and your business, such as bank account details, name, address, phone number, date of birth, social security number, tax identifier (EIN), photo identification and nationality.</p></li><li><p>Information you share with us in connection with surveys, contests or promotions.</p></li><li><p>Information from your use of the Services or, where you are an End User, from your use of Users\u2019 sites. This includes: IP addresses, preferences, web pages you visited prior to coming to our or our Users\u2019 sites, information about your browser, network or device (such as browser type and version, operating system, internet service provider, preference settings, unique device IDs and language and other regional settings), information about how you interact with the Services and our Users\u2019 sites (such as timestamps, clicks, scrolling, browsing times, searches, transactions, referral pages, load times, and problems you may encounter, such as loading errors).</p></li><li><p>Information we get from our partners to support our marketing initiatives, improve our Services and better monitor, manage and measure our ad campaigns, such as details about when a partner of ours shows you one of our ads on or via its advertising platform.</p></li><li><p>Other information you submit to us directly or through Third Party Services if you use a Third Party Service to create an Account (based on your privacy settings with such Third Party Service).</p></li></ul><p><strong>4. How we collect personal information</strong></p><p>We obtain personal information from various sources. We do this in three main ways:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p>You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an Account).</p></li><li><p>We record some of it automatically when you use our Services or Users\u2019 sites (including with technologies like cookies).</p></li><li><p>We receive some of it from third parties (like when you register for an account using a Third Party Service, when you purchase our products from an authorized reseller or when you make payments to us using our payment processor or via a mobile app store).</p></li></ul><p>We\u2019ve described this in more detail below.</p><p><strong>a. Personal information you provide</strong></p><p>When you use our Services, we collect information from you in a number of ways. For instance, we ask you to provide your name and email address to register and manage your Account. We also maintain your marketing preferences and the emails and other communications that you send us or otherwise contribute, such as customer support inquiries or posts to our customer message boards or forums. You might also provide us with information in other ways, including by responding to surveys, submitting a form or participating in contests or similar promotions.</p><p>Sometimes we require you to provide us with information for contractual or legal reasons. For example: (i) when you register or transfer a domain name through the Services, in order to comply with ICANN, registry, ccTLD or registrar policies, we collect your domain registration information; (ii) we may ask you to provide a mailing address and/or select your jurisdiction when you sign up for Paid Services to determine if, and how much, tax we need to collect from you; or (iii) if you use the Squarespace Payments Services through the Services, in accordance with the Squarespace Payments Terms, in order to provide the Squarespace Payments Services and to comply with our contractual and legal obligations, we collect additional information related to the Squarespace Payments Services and Processor Services, including information about you and your business, such as bank account details, name, address, phone number, date of birth, social security number, tax identifier (EIN), photo identification and nationality. We\u2019ll normally let you know when information is required, and the consequences of failing to provide it. If you do not provide personal information when requested, you may not be able to use our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with the service or if we are legally required to collect it.</p><p><strong>b. Personal information obtained from your use of our Services</strong></p><p>When you use our Services, we collect information about your activity on and interaction with the Services, such as your IP address(es), your device and browser type, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, what pages on our sites you visit and for how long and identifiers associated with your devices. If you\u2019ve given us permission through your device settings, we may collect your location information in our mobile apps.</p><p>If you are an End User of our Users\u2019 sites, we also get information about your interactions with their sites, though we use this in anonymous, aggregated or pseudonymized form which does not identify you directly. We use this data to evaluate, provide, protect or improve our Services (including by developing new products and services).</p><p>Some of this information is collected automatically using cookies and similar technologies when you use our Services and our Users\u2019 sites. We let our Users control what cookies and similar technologies are used through their sites (except those we need to use to properly provide the Services, such as for performance or security related reasons). You can read more about our use of cookies in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/cookie-policy\">Cookie Policy</a>. Some of this information is similarly collected automatically through your browser or from your device.</p><p><strong>c. Personal information obtained from other sources</strong></p><p>If you use a Third Party Service (such as Google) to register for an Account, the Third Party Service may provide us with your Third Party Service account information on your behalf, such as your name and email address (we don\u2019t collect or store passwords you use to access Third Party Services). Your privacy settings on the Third Party Service normally control what they share with us. Make sure you are comfortable with what they share by reviewing their privacy policies and, if necessary, modifying your privacy settings directly on the Third Party Service.</p><p>If you sign up for Paid Services via a Third Party Service acting as an authorized reseller of our products, the authorized reseller may provide us with: (i) account information on your behalf, such as your name and email address; and (ii) information necessary for us to complete your Paid Services sign up, such as your domain registration information.</p><p>If you sign up for Paid Services directly with us, we obtain limited information about your payment card from our payment processor, such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date. Currently, our payment processor is Stripe. Stripe uses and processes your complete payment information in accordance with <a href=\"https://stripe.com/privacy/\">Stripe\u2019s privacy policy</a>. This paragraph is not applicable if you sign up for Paid Services as an in-app purchase via a mobile app store in which case the mobile app store\u2019s privacy policy will apply. Please see<a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\"> Google's privacy policy</a> and<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/\"> Apple's privacy policy</a> for information about how they use and process your payment information. This paragraph is also not applicable if you sign up for Paid Services via a Third Party Service acting as an authorized reseller of our products. Please see the authorized reseller\u2019s privacy policy for information about how they use and process your payment information.</p><p><strong>5.

For example, we may decide not to advertise our Services to you on a social media site if you already signed up for Paid Services or we may choose to serve you a particular advertisement based on your subscription plan or what we think may interest you based on other information we hold about you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customizing the Services.</strong>&nbsp;Provide you with customized services. For example, we use your location information to determine your language preferences or display accurate date and time information.

For example, if we learn that most Users of Paid Services use a particular integration or feature, we might wish to expand on that integration or feature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security.</strong> Ensure the security and integrity of our Services. If you use the Squarespace Payments Services through the Services, in accordance with the Squarespace Payments Terms, conduct fraud and risk monitoring, verify your identity, determine if you are eligible to use certain Squarespace Payments Services, and investigate fraud, mitigate financial loss or other harm to you, other Users or your or their End Users.</p></li><li><p><strong>Third party relationships.</strong>&nbsp;Manage our vendor and partner relationships.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enforcement.</strong>&nbsp;Enforce our <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/terms-of-service\">Terms of Service</a> and other legal terms and policies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protection.</strong>&nbsp;Protect our and others\u2019 interests, rights and property (e.g., to protect our Users from abuse).</p></li><li><p><strong>Complying with law</strong>.&nbsp;Comply with applicable legal requirements, such as tax and other government regulations and industry standards, contracts or law enforcement requests.

When you consent, you can change your mind at any time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance of a contract.</strong>&nbsp;We need your personal information to provide you with services and products requested by you, or to respond to your inquiries.

How we share your personal information</strong></p><p>We share personal information in the following ways:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p><strong>Affiliates.</strong>&nbsp;We share personal information with our affiliates when it is reasonably necessary or desirable, such as to help provide services to you or analyze and improve the services we or they provide.</p></li><li><p><strong>Users.</strong>&nbsp;We share with our Users data regarding usage by End Users of their sites. For example, we provide a User with information about what web page the End User visited before coming to their site and how their End Users interacted with their site. This is so Users can analyze the usage of their sites and improve their services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Payments Services third party service providers.</strong> If you use the Squarespace Payments Services through the Services, in accordance with the Squarespace Payments Terms, we may use certain third party service providers (including <a href=\"https://stripe.com/privacy\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\"https://sift.com/service-privacy\">Sift</a> and <a href=\"https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy\">Plaid)</a> to: (i) operate and provide the Squarespace Payments Services, (ii) provide Processing Services, (iii) perform administrative payment functions, (iv) perform individual identity or bank verification, and (v) prevent or investigate suspected risk, fraud, security threats, illegal and malicious activity or violations of the Squarespace Payments Terms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Domain registration partners.</strong> If required to comply with ICANN, registry, ccTLD or registrar policies, we share your domain registration information with such domain registration partners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business partners.</strong>&nbsp;We may share personal information with business partners. For example, we may share your personal information when our Services are integrated with their Third Party Services, but only when you have been informed or would otherwise expect such sharing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Third party plugins and social networks.</strong> We may share personal information with website plugins, social media platforms or similar Third Party Services to improve your experience, at your direction, or when you intentionally interact with the plug-in. For example, when you use a Third Party Service to create or log in to your Account, we may share your personal information with that Third Party Service.</p></li><li><p><strong>Service providers.</strong>&nbsp;We share personal information with our service providers that perform services on our behalf. For example, we may use third parties to help us provide customer support, manage our advertisements on other sites, send marketing and other communications on our behalf or assist with data storage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Process payments.</strong>&nbsp;We transmit some of your personal information via an encrypted connection to our payment processor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Following the law or protecting rights and interests.</strong>&nbsp;We disclose your personal information if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, protect our or others\u2019 rights, property or interests (such as enforcing our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/terms-of-service\">Terms of Service</a>) or prevent fraud or abuse of Squarespace or our Users or End Users. In particular, we may disclose your personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advertising.</strong>&nbsp;We share personal information with third parties so they and we can provide you with tailored advertising and measure and monitor its effectiveness. For example, we may share your pseudonymized email address with a third party social media platform on which we advertise to avoid serving Squarespace ads to people who already use Squarespace.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business transfers.</strong>&nbsp;If we're involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of some or all of our assets, your personal information may be transferred as part of that deal or the negotiation of contemplated deals.</p></li></ul><p><strong>7. Your rights and choices</strong></p><p>Where applicable law requires (and subject to any relevant exceptions under law), you may have the right to access, update, change or delete personal information.</p><p>You can access, update, change or delete personal information (or that of your End Users) in your Account. You can also delete your account by following the instructions in<a href=\"https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/228036268-Deleting-your-account\"> this support guide</a>. Please note that we may need to verify your identity in connection with your requests, and such verification process may, if you do not have access to your Account, require you to provide us with additional information we maintain about you to verify your identity. Even if you have access to your Account, we may request additional information if we believe it\u2019s necessary to verify your identity. If we are unable to verify your identity or request, we may not, in accordance with applicable law, be able to fulfill your request. You may also contact us by email at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@squarespace.com\">privacy@squarespace.com</a> to submit an access, update, change or deletion request.</p><p>You can also elect not to receive marketing communications by changing your preferences in your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions in such communications.</p><p>Please note that, for technical reasons, there is likely to be a delay in deleting your personal information from our systems when you ask us to delete it. We also will retain personal information in order to comply with the law, protect our and others\u2019 rights, resolve disputes or enforce our legal terms or policies, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p><p>You may have the right to restrict or object to the processing of your personal information or to exercise a right to data portability under applicable law. You also may have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority, subject to applicable law. If you are subject to EU data protection laws, we suggest you lodge any such complaints with our lead supervisory authority:</p><p>Irish Data Protection Commissioner<br>Data Protection Commission<br>21 Fitzwilliam Square South, Dublin 2, D02 RD28&nbsp;<br>Ireland<br>Phone 01 7650100 &amp; 1800437 737<br>Email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@dataprotection.ie\">info@dataprotection.ie</a></p><p>If you are a resident of the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d) or otherwise subject to UK data protection laws, you may lodge such complaints with the UK supervisory authority:</p><p>Information Commissioner's Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF United Kingdom, Phone 0303 123 1113, <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/live-chat/\">Live Chat</a></p><p>Additionally, if we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When you do so, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent withdrawal.</p><p>Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/cookie-policy\">Cookie Policy</a>&nbsp;explains how you can manage cookies and similar technologies.</p><p>If you are an End User of one of our User\u2019s sites, you should contact them to exercise your rights with respect to any information they hold about you which they control.</p><p><strong>8. How we protect your personal information</strong></p><p>While no service is completely secure, we have a security team dedicated to keeping personal information safe. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards that are intended to appropriately protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse and any other unlawful form of processing, of the personal information in our possession. We employ security measures such as using firewalls to protect against intruders, building redundancies throughout our network (so that if one server goes down, another can cover for it) and testing for and protecting against network vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>9. How we retain your personal information</strong></p><p>We retain personal information regarding you or your use of the Services for as long as your Account is active or for as long as needed to provide you or our Users with the Services. We also retain personal information for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect us in the event of disputes and to enforce our agreements and to protect our and others\u2019 interests.</p><p>The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your Account is active, while the period for which we keep a support message is based on how long has passed since the last submission in the thread.</p><p>As Users may have a seasonal site or come back to us after an Account becomes inactive, we don\u2019t immediately delete your personal information when your trial expires or you cancel all Paid Services. Instead, we keep your personal information for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.</p><p>You may delete your Account by following the instructions in<a href=\"https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/228036268-Deleting-your-account\"> this support guide</a> and/or&nbsp;contacting us at<a href=\"mailto:privacy@squarespace.com\">&nbsp;privacy@squarespace.com</a>&nbsp;and Squarespace will delete the personal information it holds about you (unless we need to retain it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy).</p><p>Please note that in the course of providing the Services, we collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or de-personalized information which we may retain indefinitely.</p><p><strong>10. Data transfers</strong></p><p>Personal information that you submit through the Services may be transferred to countries other than where you live, such as, for example, to our servers in the U.S. We also store personal information locally on the devices you use to access the Services.</p><p>Your personal information may be transferred to countries that do not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.&nbsp;For example, data we store may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances.</p><p>We rely upon a number of means to transfer personal information which is subject to: (a) the European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in accordance with Chapter V of the GDPR; or (b) applicable UK data privacy laws in accordance therewith.

When it comes to your personal information, we believe in transparency, not surprises. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve set out here what personal information we collect, what we do with it and your choices and rights.By using any of Squarespace\u2019s Services, you confirm you have agreed to the\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and read and understood this Privacy Policy and our\u00a0Cookie Policy.Certain jurisdictions require us to provide you with specific additional information. Please see this page for such additional information if you are in: (I) California; or (II) Virginia,\u00a0Colorado, Connecticut or Utah.1. Some key termsIn our Privacy Policy, when we refer to \u201cUsers\u201d, we mean our customers who use our Services, including visitors to our sites. We explain who we are in the \u201cWho is Squarespace?\u201d section below.\u00a0The users, visitors and customers of our Users\u2019 sites are \u201cEnd Users\u201d. Any other capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings in our\u00a0Terms of Service.2. How does this Privacy Policy apply?This Privacy Policy describes what we do with personal information that we collect and use for our own purposes (i.e., where we are a controller), such as your account information and information about how you use and interact with our Services, including information you submit to our customer support as well as certain information relating to your End Users, such as, if applicable, End User information provided to the Squarespace Payments Services (as defined in the Squarespace Payments Terms). This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information of our employees or job applicants (except to the extent employees or job applicants are Users). This Privacy Policy also includes the right to object to certain types of processing we carry out (see Section 7 below to find out more).We use cookies and similar technologies. Our\u00a0Cookie Policy\u00a0describes what we do in that regard.With respect to personal information in Squarespace\u2019s possession, we play a few different roles under global data privacy laws. In order to understand your and Squarespace\u2019s obligations, it\u2019s important to understand the difference between Squarespace Controlled PI and User Controlled PI.\u00a0\u201cSquarespace Controlled PI\u201d means personal information for which Squarespace determines the purposes and means of processing. This Privacy Policy and this additional U.S. state information page only address Squarespace Controlled PI.\u201cUser Controlled PI\u201d means personal information for which a User determines the purposes and means of processing. For User Controlled PI, Squarespace acts as a data processor, service provider or similar term under applicable law. User Controlled PI includes User Content and End Users' personal information described in Section 12 that we host and process on behalf of our Users. Our Users tell us what we do with User Controlled PI on our Users\u2019 instructions. Our Users are responsible for ensuring that their collection and processing of User Controlled PI complies with applicable law. If you are a User looking for contractual provisions about how Squarespace will treat and secure your User Controlled PI, please see our Data Processing Addendum.We explain below how we collect and use Squarespace Controlled PI and your rights. If you are an End User of one of our User\u2019s sites and want to know how a User handles your information, you should check the site's privacy policy.3. Personal information we collectWe collect various personal information regarding you or your device. This includes the following:Information you provide to create an Account, specifically email address, first name and last name.Information you provide if you sign up for Paid Services.

How we collect personal informationWe obtain personal information from various sources. We do this in three main ways:You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an Account).We record some of it automatically when you use our Services or Users\u2019 sites (including with technologies like cookies).We receive some of it from third parties (like when you register for an account using a Third Party Service, when you purchase our products from an authorized reseller or when you make payments to us using our payment processor or via a mobile app store).We\u2019ve described this in more detail below.a. Personal information you provideWhen you use our Services, we collect information from you in a number of ways. For instance, we ask you to provide your name and email address to register and manage your Account. We also maintain your marketing preferences and the emails and other communications that you send us or otherwise contribute, such as customer support inquiries or posts to our customer message boards or forums. You might also provide us with information in other ways, including by responding to surveys, submitting a form or participating in contests or similar promotions.Sometimes we require you to provide us with information for contractual or legal reasons. For example: (i) when you register or transfer a domain name through the Services, in order to comply with ICANN, registry, ccTLD or registrar policies, we collect your domain registration information; (ii) we may ask you to provide a mailing address and/or select your jurisdiction when you sign up for Paid Services to determine if, and how much, tax we need to collect from you; or (iii) if you use the Squarespace Payments Services through the Services, in accordance with the Squarespace Payments Terms, in order to provide the Squarespace Payments Services and to comply with our contractual and legal obligations, we collect additional information related to the Squarespace Payments Services and Processor Services, including information about you and your business, such as bank account details, name, address, phone number, date of birth, social security number, tax identifier (EIN), photo identification and nationality.

We use this data to evaluate, provide, protect or improve our Services (including by developing new products and services).Some of this information is collected automatically using cookies and similar technologies when you use our Services and our Users\u2019 sites. We let our Users control what cookies and similar technologies are used through their sites (except those we need to use to properly provide the Services, such as for performance or security related reasons). You can read more about our use of cookies in our\u00a0Cookie Policy. Some of this information is similarly collected automatically through your browser or from your device.c. Personal information obtained from other sourcesIf you use a Third Party Service (such as Google) to register for an Account, the Third Party Service may provide us with your Third Party Service account information on your behalf, such as your name and email address (we don\u2019t collect or store passwords you use to access Third Party Services). Your privacy settings on the Third Party Service normally control what they share with us. Make sure you are comfortable with what they share by reviewing their privacy policies and, if necessary, modifying your privacy settings directly on the Third Party Service.If you sign up for Paid Services via a Third Party Service acting as an authorized reseller of our products, the authorized reseller may provide us with: (i) account information on your behalf, such as your name and email address; and (ii) information necessary for us to complete your Paid Services sign up, such as your domain registration information.If you sign up for Paid Services directly with us, we obtain limited information about your payment card from our payment processor, such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date. Currently, our payment processor is Stripe. Stripe uses and processes your complete payment information in accordance with Stripe\u2019s privacy policy. This paragraph is not applicable if you sign up for Paid Services as an in-app purchase via a mobile app store in which case the mobile app store\u2019s privacy policy will apply.
