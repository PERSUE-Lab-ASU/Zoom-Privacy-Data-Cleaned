<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><em>Updated April 19, 2020</em></p>

<p>This privacy policy exists to explain what information we collect, what we 
do with it, and how we protect it.

</p><h4>What we collect and what we do with it</h4>

<p>If you're a patient who books an appointment with a practice who uses 
NextPatient, your information will be saved in our database and 
transfered to the practice you've selected.

</p><p>The combination of your name, email, phone number, and DOB will be used to 
uniquely identify you to the practice, which will allow them to determine if 
you're a new or existing patient.

</p><p>Your "reason for visit" will be used by the practice to plan accordingly and
confirm that the visit is appropriate.

</p><p>We may use your phone number and email address to send appointment 
confirmations, reminders, and other messages related to your visit.

</p><p>If we collect payment for a visit, we may send your information to financial
partners to facilitate payment.

</p><p>We do not:

</p><ul>
<li>run ads on our platform
</li><li>sell patient or practice data to third parties
</li><li>use cookies to follow patients on other sites
</li></ul>

<h4>Data Retention</h4>

<p>NextPatient will maintain practice data for at least as long as the practice
is a customer of NextPatient.

</p><p>NextPatient will maintain audit logs recording which practice employees
accessed the NextPatient admin pages, and which patient records were viewed.

</p><p>If a practice discontinues using NextPatient, they may request we delete all
practice data beyond the practice's name, contact information, service dates, 
payment history, and anything else needed to maintain a record of the practice
as a customer.

</p><p>This deletion will be completed within 7 days of being requested. Note, however, 
practice data may be held for a longer period in backups maintained for disaster 
recovery.

</p><p>If the practice does not request a deletion, the practice data may live in NextPatient's 
database indefinitely, and can be made available to the practice upon request.

</p><h4>How we protect your information</h4>

<p>All web traffic is encrypted is encrypted via SSL.

</p><p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only 
accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such 
systems.

</p><p>When we send emails regarding appointments, we will include your name, email, 
and name of the practice, but we won't include your date of birth or any medical 
information.

</p><p>Your DOB and Reason for Visit will only be transfered to the medical practice 
over encrypted channels.

</p><h4>How we use cookies</h4>

<p>We use cookies to:
	
</p><ul>
<li>Store login information that persists across the user's session.	
</li><li>Generate website traffic reports in Google Analytics (GA). GA 
uses their own cookies to provide this information.

</li></ul>

make book appointments.

</p><h4>Third Party Disclosure</h4>

information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not 
include:

</p><ul>
<li>any medical practices we're contacting on your behalf
</li><li>website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our 
website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties 
agree to keep this information confidential. 
</li></ul>

<p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to 
other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

</p><h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>

</p><ul>

<h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 
13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces 
the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services 
must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.

</p><h4>Fair Information Practices</h4>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law 
in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant 
role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding 
the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented 
is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal 
information.

</p><p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach 
occur, we will notify the users via email within 7 business days
	
</p><p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that 
individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data 
collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires 
not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also 
that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate 
and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

</p><h4>CAN SPAM Act</h4>

<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, 
establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right 
to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough 
penalties for violations.

</p><p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following: If at any time 
you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us 
at privacy@nextpatient.co and we will promptly remove you from all 
correspondence.

</p><h4>Contacting Us</h4>

<p>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact 
us at privacy@nextpatient.co.
