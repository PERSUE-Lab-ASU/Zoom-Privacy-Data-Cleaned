<p><b>Usage Data and Site Activity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Usage Data” is information or content we collect about the use of our Site or Services in a way that does not identify an individual user. Usage Data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor or enhance our Services. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of Usage Data, and we may share Usage Data with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our users’ needs and to improve our Services. For example, each time you use the Site we may automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, the pages you view, how you interact with links on the Services and the time and duration of your visits to the Site. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors or users of our Site or application, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, etc.</span></p>
<p><b>Cookies and Web Beacons</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser). We may also use Web beacons (a file placed on a website that monitors usage). We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the experience of the Site and Services, such as pre-populating your username for easier login. We do not use cookies or Web beacons to collect Personal Information. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. At this time, Fynancial does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking, including “do-not-track” signals. You can remove persistent cookies and change your privacy preferences by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. However, certain features of the Site or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our Service Providers may use their own cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf, as further explained below.</span></p>
<p><b>How We Use Information and When We May Share and Disclose Information Generally</b></p>

<p><b>Service Providers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses that we believe to be trustworthy and have privacy practices consistent with ours (“Service Providers”). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, and marketing and promotions. We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
