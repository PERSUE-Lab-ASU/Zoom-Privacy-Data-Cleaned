Following is a description of the types of data we collect and the purposes of collection and processing.</p>\n<h3>2.1 Information We Collect Directly From You</h3>\n<h4>2.1.1 Essential Account Data</h4>\n<p>We receive Personal Information directly from you when you provide it to us as part of creating an account, including, but not limited to, at least:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full Name</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These data are processed in order to provide you with Services and secure access to your account.</p>\n<h4>2.1.2 Contact Information</h4>\n<p>We may collect contact information for both present and prospective customers including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, title, and company name, from various sources, including offline marketing activities.</p>\n<p>We process this information for marketing purposes and to provide support to present and prospective customers.</p>\n<h4>2.1.3 Online Form, Email, and Chat Data</h4>\n<p>When you fill out an online form, for example, to subscribe to a newsletter or engage in email or online chat communications with us, you may voluntarily supply us a contact and other information and we may also retain a record of any communications with you or activities you perform.</p>\n<p>Data from these sources is processed in order to supply you with information that you request from us, and may be used for direct marketing and analytic purposes.</p>\n<h4>2.1.4 Third-Party Service Connection</h4>\n<p>Our Service allows you to connect various third-party services (\u201cThird-Party Services\u201d). When you connect a Third-Party Service and grant us permission to access your account, we never request or receive your log-in credentials for that Third-Party Service.</p>\n<p>We use the OAuth authorization protocol to request a token from the Third-Party Service; the token then gives us access to your account to the extent authorized by you and permitted by that Third-Party Service.</p>\n<h4>2.1.5 Support Ticket Data</h4>\n<p>When you submit a support ticket through our systems, we will collect the company and contact data, and record activity related to your request.</p>\n<p>Information submitted as part of support tickets is processed by us in order to provide help to you in using the Service, to contact you about your request(s), and to improve the Service.</p>\n<h4>2.1.6 Information We Receive From Third-Party Sources</h4>\n<p>When you enable the Service to connect Third-Party Services, the Third-Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that you may have provided to the Third-Party Services and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such Third-Party Services, and Akiflow shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third- Party Services that may be enabled within the Service.</p>\n<h4>2.1.7 Cookies and tracking technologies</h4>\n<p>We also use technologies such as cookies, local storage (as defined below), scripts to collect information, provide a better user experience, and improve our services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device. We may use \u201cpersistent cookies\u201d to save your ID for future logins to the service. We may use \u201csession ID cookies\u201d to enable certain features of the service, to better understand how you interact with the service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the service. \u201cLocal storage\u201d is a way for a website to collect and store information \u201clocally\u201d (e.g., on the user\u2019s device rather than on the website\u2019s server) and then later retrieve it again. Local storage includes \u201clocalStorage\u201d and \u201csessionStorage.\u201d By using local storage, a user\u2019s visits can, for example, be stored on their own computer, counted, and then given to us.</p>\n<h3>2.2 Information We Automatically Collect When You Use Our Service</h3>\n<p>Some Personal Information is automatically collected when you visit our Sites or use our Service, through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.

The Personal Data of third parties could for example be entered in the description of a task or an event, or in the list of guests of an event. The Service also allows Users to connect to Third-Party Services to transfer data from those Third-Party Services into the Apps, periodically or on-demand, and store such data on the servers of the Service. Storing data in our server is done with the purpose of providing you with additional features, such as multi-device synchronisation of your data, and backup in case your device is not recoverable (lost/broken).</p>\n<p>Users shall not use the Service to process personal data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership.

We may do so through fully automated systems.</p>\n<p>In addition, Akiflow gathers anonymized usage data from users of the Apps and the Service. Before storing this anonymized usage data in Service-specific log files, we redact any Personal Information or other specific data, such as search terms entered in the Apps. We may share the Service log files with third-party analytic tools to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, track usage of various features within the Service, or otherwise as necessary to improve the Service.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, we may connect Personal Information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers when specific needs of individual users arise, such as, but not limited to, bug fixing.</p>\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>\n<p>Akiflow will not sell or rent any of the Personal Information or User Data that you provide us to any third party.

When users share data with third-party services (e.g. any of our integrations), the shared data becomes subject to the privacy practices of those external platforms. In these cases, Akiflow does not control how data is displayed or managed outside its environment.</p>\n<h2>7.

Please be assured that the transfer of data to sub-processors is confined strictly to the purposes outlined in this policy, and under no circumstances we engage in the sale of data or permit the transfer of data to other entities for objectives other than those explicitly delineated herein.</p>\n<p>In all situations where Akiflow discloses Personal Information or User Data to third parties acting as service providers or \u201cagents\u201d on behalf of Akiflow, Akiflow will require the recipient to protect and only use such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and with applicable regulations. We do not permit our service providers to use any data we share for their marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>By using the Service, you warrant that Akiflow has your permission to perform any such transfers on your behalf, notwithstanding that these may contain Personal Information and User Data and may cross international borders.</p>\n<p>The updated list of the third-party service providers to whom we share with some Personal Information can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://akiflow.com/legal/sub-processors\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>In the event of onward transfers of data to third parties, we remain liable in accordance with our obligations under the applicable data protection frameworks, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

When you connect a Third-Party Service and grant us permission to access your account, we never request or receive your log-in credentials for that Third-Party Service.\nWe use the OAuth authorization protocol to request a token from the Third-Party Service; the token then gives us access to your account to the extent authorized by you and permitted by that Third-Party Service.\n2.1.5 Support Ticket Data\nWhen you submit a support ticket through our systems, we will collect the company and contact data, and record activity related to your request.\nInformation submitted as part of support tickets is processed by us in order to provide help to you in using the Service, to contact you about your request(s), and to improve the Service.\n2.1.6 Information We Receive From Third-Party Sources\nWhen you enable the Service to connect Third-Party Services, the Third-Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that you may have provided to the Third-Party Services and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
