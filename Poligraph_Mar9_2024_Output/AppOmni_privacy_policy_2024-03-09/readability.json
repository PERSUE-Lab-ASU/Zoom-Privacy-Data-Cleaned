For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Site and help the content of the pages you request to load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.\n\n\n\n\nFunctionality Cookies\n\n\nThese cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Site which you can customise. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Site.\n\n\n\n\nAnalytics and Performance Cookies\n\n\nThese cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered via these cookies does not \u201cdirectly\u201d identify any individual visitor. However, it may render such visitors \u201cindirectly identifiable\u201d. This is because the information collected is typically linked to a pseudonymous identifier associated with the device you use to access our Site.\u00a0\u00a0The information collected is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information.\u00a0 We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site. We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how our Site works.

These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites.\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Cookies\n\n\nThese cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \u201clike\u201d button on our Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through, or whilst simultaneously logged into, a social networking website such as Facebook. The social network will record that you have done this.\n\n\n\n\nDisabling cookies\nYou can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the \u201csettings\u201d, \u201chelp\u201d \u201ctools\u201d or \u201cedit\u201d facility).\u00a0 Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.
