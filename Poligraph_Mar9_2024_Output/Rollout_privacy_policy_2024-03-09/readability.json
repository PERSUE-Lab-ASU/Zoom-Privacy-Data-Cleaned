This website is operated by Rollout and has been created to provide information about our company and its content and data automation platform and related services (together with the website, the \"Service(s)\") to our Service visitors (\"you\", \"your\"). \u201cPersonal Data\u201d means any information relating to, or which can reasonably be ascribed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

For Workflow Content (content transferred in and out of automated workflows in your Partner account), you, the User, are considered the \u201cdata controller\u201d of that data from a privacy perspective.</p>\n<p>In turn, Rollout is the \u201cdata processor\u201d responsible for safeguarding Workflow Content as it flows through Rollout's systems.
