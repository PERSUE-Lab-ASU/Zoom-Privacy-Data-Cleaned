        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how and when Pitch Patterns handles any personal data intentionally or unintentionally provided during the use of Pitch Patterns Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Sites and Services are designed for businesses and are not intended for personal or household use. Accordingly, we treat all personal data covered by this Privacy Policy, including information about any visitors to our website, as pertaining to individuals acting as business representatives, rather than in their personal capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pitch Patterns is maintained by SIA Asya, a company registered in Latvia under the registry code: 40203171916, registered address: Pils iela 17, Ventspils, Latvia, LV-3601 (hereinafter, the “Pitch Patterns”, “we”, “us”, “our”).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What Information We Collect &amp; Why</strong><br>
            To continue our research, improve Artificial intelligence technology (“AI”), provide, secure, and improve our Services, fulfill our obligations and reach our legitimate goals, we may need to acquire, receive and keep information which in some cases will include personal data. We may need to use, process, and transmit Personal Data to render our Services and fulfill our legal obligations, to provide you and others with our Service, and to process and fulfill your transactions and other requests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visitors of our website and users of our Services may be required to provide their name, title, company, email address, location, phone number, payment information, account and website activity, IP addresses, cookies identifiers, and other information that will or may allow us to identify them (collectively, the “Personal Data”). We have implemented the minimisation principle, which means we will only process the data necessary for a certain task.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Services enable our users to collect, process, store, analyze and share the contents of communications along with associated and necessary data and documentation. These recordings and analysis thereof may also contain personal information, such as voice recordings, voice profiles, names, titles, and contact information, as well as other information. Contents of any conversations and the respective recordings are the responsibility of all participants of the respective conversation. By using Pitch Patterns services, you, our users, clients, and affiliates have agreed to the <a href="/legal/tos">Terms and Conditions</a> and are obligated to check any data for confidential information, sensitive information and personal data before processing any information through our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you provide us with any personally identifiable information about any third person, you state that you have that third person’s explicit consent for their information to be collected, processed, used, and stored as outlined in this Privacy Policy and any agreement you have entered into with us, and for any other ways you may use that information; you are responsible for ensuring that your use, control, processing and treatment of such information and any of your legal policies relating thereto comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. We may also receive personal data as part of any data you, users, clients, and affiliates may send to us during our day-to-day operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            For us to be able to provide users with additional features, personalize, monitor, and improve the Services we provide, collection of usage data may be necessary. Information from and about the devices used to access the Services, such as IP addresses, the type of browser and device, visited web pages and identifiers associated with devices may also be processed during the use of our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Services may provide the ability to identify each user by voice and process the information accordingly, by applying various tools provided by us. The AI does this by matching the user’s Biometric data with other identifying data provided during the use of our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Google User data processing is automated and carried out by our AI without the direct involvement of our employees. </strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our employees will not access, view, or process any Google User data themselves unless specifically requested by the User in case of technical difficulties or during customer or technical support operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data from Google Drive is downloaded and analyzed using our AI, after which the data is stored using a cloud-based storage service. Users can access all data, as well as demand its deletion and use other rights outlined in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not transfer Google User data to any third parties unless it is required and approved by the User.
        </p>
        <p>
            The way we use Google User data is limited by what we have described in this Privacy Policy and any use of Google User data will be in accordance with our data safety protocols and practices outlined herein. All the necessary information on how we process and store personal data is provided in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Biometric data</strong><br>
            “Biometric data” means personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as voiceprints and voice profiles. Without the processing of Biometric data, some of our tools and Services may be unavailable to our users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each user of our Services is required to expressly consent to the processing of his/her Biometric data before first use and engagement with our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will keep any Biometric data provided to us during the use of our Services for as long as the applicable user account is active, to provide the Services required by the user, unless consent for us to keep it is withdrawn, or the data is no longer needed. We may retain Biometric data longer solely to comply with applicable Laws.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may withdraw your consent and ask for your Biometric data to be deleted by sending a request to <a href="mailto:policies@pitchpatterns.com">policies@pitchpatterns.com</a>. It is our policy to protect, use and store Biometric data in accordance with all applicable laws including, but not limited to, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
