We are committed to ensuring that when you use our services or engage with us, you know what personal information or data (<strong>Personal Data</strong>) we collect about you and how we use your Personal Data. This data privacy notice (<strong>Privacy Notice</strong>) is a statement that describes how we will use your Personal Data. Please take the time to read and understand our Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>It is important that you read this Privacy Notice together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing Personal Data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your Personal Data. This Privacy Notice supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.</p>
<p>Data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, like the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) and in the UK, differentiate between “controllers” and “processors” of personal information. A controller determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data. A processor processes personal information on behalf of a controller based on the controller’s instructions. We are mainly a processor of Personal Data but in some instances act as a controller as well. This privacy notices explains how we process Personal Data as a controller.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice also explains how we process Personal Data as a personal information handling business operator subject to the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Act No.57 of 2003, as amended) of Japan and its relevant implementation regulations and guidelines (<strong>APPI</strong>).</p></div>

<p>In this Privacy Notice, <strong>you</strong> or <strong>your</strong> means an individual who is the subject of Personal Data we handle, subject to the local data protection laws, or process as a data controller, which would: (i) typically be the representatives, and end users of our corporate customers (which could be either communication operators or other corporate customers) that interact with us and manage and use our call recording and transcription facilities or our other corporate services; and (ii) the data subjects of a small number of recordings and audios we spot check for support, quality and product development purposes only – we do not otherwise control stored audios or recordings.</p>
<p>If you are a European Union (<strong>EU</strong>) data subject the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the <strong>EU GDPR</strong>) applies. If you are in the UK, the Data Protection Act 2018 applies along with the GDPR as amended and adopted by UK law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the <strong>UK GDPR</strong>). The EU GDPR and the UK GDPR are collectively referred in this notice to as the <strong>GDPR</strong> and, in this context, <strong>Dubber</strong>, <strong>we</strong>, <strong>our</strong> or <strong>us</strong> refers to Dubber Limited, reg. no 10093254 of 49 Greek Street, London W1D 4EG, UK, otherwise each of those terms refers to Dubber Pty Ltd ACN 150 843 164 of Level 5, 2 Russell Street, Melbourne Vic. 3000, Australia.</p>
<p>If you are an EU or a UK data subject, the controller of your Personal Data is Dubber Limited.</p>

<p>APPI applies in those cases where a personal information handling business operator who, in relation to supplying services to persons in Japan, has collected personal information and/or personal data relating to the person who is the data subject, handles the personal information. In this context, <strong>Dubber</strong>, <strong>we</strong>, <strong>our</strong> or <strong>us</strong> refers to Dubber Pty Ltd ACN 150 843 164 of Level 5, 2 Russell Street, Melbourne Vic. 3000, Australia and, if you are a data subject to which APPI applies, the Personal Information Handling Business Operator of your Personal Data is that entity.</p>

<p>EU and UK data subjects and data subjects to which APPI applies also have the following rights in accordance with GDPR and APPI respectively:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;<b>Request access</b><span>&nbsp;</span>to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;<b>Request correction</b><span>&nbsp;</span>of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to Us.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;<b>Request erasure of your Personal Data.</b><span>&nbsp;</span>This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;<b>Object to processing</b><span>&nbsp;</span>of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which do not override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Request restriction of processing</b><span>&nbsp;</span>of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Request the transfer of your Personal Data</b><span>&nbsp;</span>to you or to a third party (commonly known as a “data portability”). We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with You.</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Withdraw consent at any time<span>&nbsp;</span></b>where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case.</p>
<p>When we receive a request for notification of the purpose of use, disclosure, correction, suspension of use, deletion, etc. of the Personal Data in our possession in accordance with APPI, we will promptly respond to the request. If you have any questions about this Privacy Notice or wish to exercise your rights, please contact us at the contact in Section 11.</p>
<h6><b>What we may require from you to exercise the rights above.</b></h6>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. We may also contact you to ask for further information in relation to your request.</p>
<h6><b>Time limit to respond to EU, UK and APPI data subject requests.</b></h6>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex, or you have made several requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<h6><b>No fee usually required to deal with EU, UK and APPI data subject requests.</b></h6>
<p>All communication and all actions taken by Dubber regarding your rights described above are provided free of charge. Dubber reserves the right, in the case of clearly unfounded or unreasonable requests, to either take out a reasonable fee calculated from actual costs covering the administrative costs of providing the information or taking the requested action or refusing to fulfil the requested action.</p></div>
