<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations). Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly. We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information based on the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal information processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).<br><br>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br><br>Please contact our Privacy Team at privacy@gainsight.com<span style="color: #5c666f;"> </span>if you have any questions about the information we collect and/or how we use the information we collect.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Your data protection rights</strong><strong><br></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: 12px;"><br></span></strong>Where we are acting as a controller, and depending on your location and subject to applicable law, you may have the following rights regarding the personal information we control about you:&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">We collect sensitive personal information for various purposes, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">As defined by the CCPA, sensitive personal information shall be treated as personal information, except where it is collected or processed for “the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer.” We do not collect or process sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about individuals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter into a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to keep that personal information confidential and use it only for performance of the contract, and not for any other purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Gainsight does not “sell” your personal information in exchange for any monetary consideration. We do share certain information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes as defined by the CCPA under Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140(ad)(2). Some of our processing activities may also constitute “targeted advertising” as that term is defined under certain state laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">We have shared in the preceding 12 months personal information as necessary for business purposes, as defined by Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140.

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;">Your Rights and How to Exercise Them</p>

A summary of those rights is provided below as well as information on how to exercise your rights. Please note that we will require certain identifying information about you as necessary for us to verify your request in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You have the right to know what personal information we collect, use, disclose and/or sell about you.

We do share certain information with third parties to market products, services, and other offers we think may be of interest to you. The CCPA broadly defines the concept of “selling” information so we offer the opportunity for California residents to opt out of our sharing information with third parties in this manner. Please note that if you opt out of this information sharing with us, we will remove you from these activities; however, other companies may continue to use and disclose your information in the same manner. You should opt out of these practices with those other companies and websites, as applicable.</li>

We will notify you if any such exceptions apply to your request.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination: </strong>You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer certain financial incentives, charge reasonable fees related to your requests, or deny your right to know, right to opt out of sale or right to deletion in accordance with applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may ask you to provide information that will enable us to verify your identity in order to comply with your request to exercise your privacy rights. You can exercise these rights yourself or you can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. Your authorized agent must be able to demonstrate authority to act on your behalf when submitting a verifiable request on your behalf. In some instances, we may decline to honor your request if an exception applies under applicable law. We will respond to your request in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may have the right to appeal our decisions made with respect to your request. To appeal our decision on your request, you may contact us through one of the contact methods described under the <strong><span style="color: #0070c0;">Contact Us</span></strong><span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span>section below).
