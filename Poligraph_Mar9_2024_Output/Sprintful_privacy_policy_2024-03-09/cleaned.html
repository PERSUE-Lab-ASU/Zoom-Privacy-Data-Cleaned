Your use of the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted will be considered to indicate your acceptance of the changes.<br><br></p><h3 id="permissions">PERMISSIONS</h3><p></p><p><strong>What permissions does Sprintful require?</strong><br>By default Spritnful does not require any special permissions.

This is a combination of data collected automatically from your behavior and data collected directly from your usage.<br><br><u>Data Collected Automatically</u>: this includes IP address, browser information, and operating system information. Whenever you interact with our Services, we receive and store this information in our own systems or in 3rd-party systems, and install a unique identifier (commonly known as “cookie”) to recognize you in future interactions. We use this data to customize content for you and present you with Services in the best way possible, and educate our internal metrics on traffic sources and content popularity. You may choose to disable cookie tracking from your device or browser settings.<br><br></p><p><u>Data Collected from Usage</u>: by authorizing and integrating Sprintful with your extenral accounts, we store direct information collected from your usage.

When a user browses or uses the Services, these third party analytics services may collect the user’s IP address, browser type, and approximate location (based on the IP address). They may also use web logs or web beacons and may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In order to refine our understanding of user engagement, we provide these services with a user’s name and email address (which we collected as part of the user’s account registration process).<br><br></p><p><u>Data Collected for Billing Purposes</u>: billing information you provide for the purpose of paying for our Services is handled by our payment processing partner (Stripe.com) and are not exposed to our servers.<br><br></p><p></p><p><strong>Do you sell personally identifiable data?</strong><br>No, and we never will.

Your information will be stored and processed in the United States or other countries where we decide to maintain datacenter facilities in the future. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of information outside of your country, even if your country has more rigorous data protection standards.<br><br></p><h3 id="retention">RETENTION</h3><p>We retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law or to otherwise fulfill a legal obligation.
