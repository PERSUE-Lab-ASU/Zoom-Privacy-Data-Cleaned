These countries to which we store, process, or transfer your personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.</p><p>If we transfer your personal information to third parties in other countries:</p><ul role="list"><li>we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of the UK GDPR (Article 45) and Data Protection Act 2018;</li><li>we will adopt appropriate safeguards for protecting the transferred data, including in transit, such as standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) or binding corporate rules.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Your Data Subject Rights</strong></p><p><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you believe your personal information has been unlawfully processed; (iii) you need us to maintain the personal information solely for the purpose of a legal claim; or (iv) we are in the process of considering your objection in relation to processing on the basis of legitimate interests.</p><p><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to processing of your personal information that is based on our legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order to proceed with the processing of your personal information.</p><p><strong>Right to be Informed:</strong> You have the right to be informed with how your data is collected, processed, shared and stored.</p><p><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you at any time by submitting a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). The statutory deadline for fulfilling a DSAR request is 30 calendar days from our receipt of your request.</p><p><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> In certain circumstances, you can ask for your personal data to be erased from the records held by organisations. However this is a qualified right; it is not absolute, and may only apply in certain circumstances.</p><ul role="list"><li>When may the right to erasure apply?</li><li>When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed for.</li><li>If consent was the lawful basis for processing personal data and that consent has been withdrawn. Waggle relies on consent to process personal data in very few circumstances.</li><li>The Company is relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis for processing personal data and an individual has exercised the right to object and it has been determined that the Company has no overriding legitimate grounds to refuse that request.</li><li>Personal data are being processed for direct marketing purposes e.g. a person’s name and email address, and the individual objects to that processing.</li><li>There is legislation that requires that personal data are to be destroyed.</li></ul><p><strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Individuals have the right to get some of their personal data from an organisation in a way that is accessible and machine-readable, for example as a csv file. Associated with this, individuals also have the right to ask an organisation to transfer their personal data to another organisation.</p><p>However, the right to portability:</p><ul role="list"><li>only applies to personal data which a person has directly given to Waggle in electronic form; and</li><li>onward transfer will only be available where this is “technically feasible”.</li></ul><p><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If personal data is inaccurate, out of date, or incomplete, individuals have the right to correct, update or complete that data. Collectively this is referred to as the right to rectification. Rectification may involve filling the gaps i.e. to have to have incomplete personal data completed – although this will depend on the purposes for the processing. This may involve adding a supplementary statement to the incomplete data to highlight any inaccuracy or claim thereof.</p><p>This right only applies to an individual’s own personal data; a person cannot seek the rectification of another person’s information.</p><p><strong>Notification of data breaches:</strong> Upon discovery of a data breach, we will investigate the incident and report it to the UK’s data protection regulator and yourself, if we deem it appropriate to do so.</p><p><strong>Complaints:</strong> You have the right, at any time, to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance using the details below. Please provide us with as much information as you can about the alleged breach. We will promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing, setting out the outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint.</p><p><strong>Enquiries, Reports and Escalation</strong></p><p>To enquire about Waggle's privacy policy, or to report violations of user privacy, you may contact our Data Protection Officer using the details in the Contact us section of this privacy policy.</p><p>If we fail to resolve your concern to your satisfaction, you may also contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK Data Protection regulator:</p><p>Information Commissioner's Office</p><p>Wycliffe House</p><p>Water Lane</p><p>Wilmslow</p><p>Cheshire</p><p>SK9 5AF</p><p>Tel: 0303 123 1113 (local rate)</p><p>Website: www.ico.org.uk</p><h2><strong>Additional Disclosures for Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Compliance (Canada)</strong></h2><p><strong>Additional scope of personal information</strong></p><p>In accordance with PIPEDA, we broaden our definition of personal information to include any information about an individual, such as financial information, information about your appearance, your views and opinion (such as those expressed online or through a survey), opinions held about you by others, and any personal correspondences you may have with us. While this information may not directly identify you, be aware that it may be combined with other information to do so.</p><p>As PIPEDA refers to personal information using the term Personally Identifying Information (PII), any references to personal information and PII in this privacy policy, and in official communications from Waggle, are intended as equivalent to one another in every way, shape and form.</p><p><strong>Valid Consent</strong></p><p>Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your information that has already taken place. When you contact us, we assume your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to your enquiry. Under PIPEDA, consent is only valid if it is reasonable to expect that an individual to whom the organization's activities are directed would understand the nature, purpose, and consequences of the collection, use, or disclosure of the personal information to which they are consenting.</p><p>Where you agree to receive marketing communications from us, we will do so based solely on your indication of consent or until you instruct us not to, which you can do at any time.</p><p>While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time, we cannot recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.</p><p><strong>International Transfers of Information</strong></p><p>While Waggle endeavors to keep, store and handle customer data within locations in Canada, it may use agents or service providers located in the United States (U.S.), European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK) to collect, use, retain and process personal information as part of providing services to you. While we use all reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information receives the same level of security in any other jurisdiction as it would in Canada, please be aware that privacy protections under U.S. laws may not be the same adequacy.</p><p><strong>Customer Data Rights</strong></p><p>Although PIPEDA does not contain an extensive set of consumer rights, it does grant consumers the right to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Access the personal information organizations hold about them;</li><li>Correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information the organization hold about them (or, if this is not possible, delete the inaccurate personal information)</li><li>Withdraw consent for any activities for which they have consented (e.g. direct marketing or cookies)</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent</strong></p><p>Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose. Subject to some restrictions, you can, at any time, refuse to consent, or continue to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of their personal information by notifying us using the email address below in the ‘Contact Us’ section. Withdrawal of consent may impact our ability to provide or continue to provide services.</p><p>Customers cannot refuse collection, use and disclosure of their personal information if such information is required to:</p><ul role="list"><li>be collected, used or disclosed as required by any law;</li><li>fulfill the terms of any contractual agreement; and</li><li>be collected, used or disclosed as required by any regulators including self regulatory organizations</li></ul><p> </p><p>While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time, we cannot recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.</p><p><strong>Right of Access under PIPEDA</strong></p><p>PIPEDA gives you a general right to access the PII held by businesses subject to this law. Under PIPEDA, you need to make your access request in writing and pay a minimal fee of $30.00.</p><p>If any organizational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain about this. We retain the right to decide how we disclose the copies of your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill your request in 30 days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:</p><ul role="list"><li>meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business activities; or</li><li>the time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to the request would make it impractical to meet the time limit.</li></ul><p>We can also extend the time limit for the length of time required to convert the personal information into an alternative format. In these circumstances, we will advise you of the delay within the first 30 days and explain the reason for it.</p><p><strong>Right of rectification under PIPEDA</strong></p><p>You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within your PII. We would ask you to provide some evidence to back up your claim. Under PIPEDA, an organization must amend the information, as required, if you successfully demonstrate that it’s incomplete or inaccurate.</p><p>You may contact us at any time, using the information provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy if you believe your PII on our systems is incorrect or incomplete.</p><p>If we cannot agree on changing the information, you have the right to have your concerns recorded with the Office of the Privacy Commission of Canada.</p><p><strong>Compliance with PIPEDA’s Ten Principles of Privacy</strong></p><p>This privacy policy complies with the PIPEDA’s requirements and ten principles of privacy, which are as follows:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Accountability</strong>.
