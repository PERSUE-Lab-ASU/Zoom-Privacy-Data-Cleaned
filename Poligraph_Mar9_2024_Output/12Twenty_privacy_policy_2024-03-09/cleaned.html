We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Website; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Website, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p><p>b.&nbsp;<strong style="font-size:14px">Cookies we use</strong></p><p>Our Website uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p><p><strong>Essential Cookies</strong></p><p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Website and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Website and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p><p><strong>Functionality Cookies</strong></p><p>These cookies allow our Website to remember choices you make when you use our Website, such as remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Website which you can customize.

The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Website, the websites that referred them to our Website, the pages they visited on our Website, what time of day they visited our Website, whether they have visited our Website before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Website more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Website.</p><p>We use Google Analytics for this purpose.

How We Protect Information</h2><p>In order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on 12twenty is password- protected, and sensitive data is protected by reasonable security when it is exchanged between your web browser and the 12twenty Website. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. To protect any data you store on our servers, we also regularly audit our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, instant messaging, and similar means of communication are generally not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.

We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on 12twenty.
