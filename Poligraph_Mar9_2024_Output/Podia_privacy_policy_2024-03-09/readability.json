To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a \u201cweb beacon\u201d) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</li>\n<li>Through the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) and Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA\u2019s or NAI\u2019s consumer opt out pages, which are located at <a href=\"http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/\">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> or <a href=\"https://www.aboutads.info/choices\">https://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.
