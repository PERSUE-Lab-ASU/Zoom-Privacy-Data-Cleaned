                  post to Techspace Antler, 32-38 Leman Street, London, E1 8EW, United Kingdom.

                  UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate
                  the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first
                  instance.
                </p>

                  In discharging our responsibilities as a Data Controller we have employees who will deal with your
                  data on our behalf (known as <b>“Processors”</b>). The responsibilities below may be assigned to an
                  individual or may be taken to apply to the organisation as a whole. The Data Controller and our
                  Processors have the following responsibilities:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 3rem">
                  <li>
                    Ensure that all processing of Personal Data is governed by one of the legal bases laid out in the
                    GDPR (see 2.2 below for more information);
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ensure that Processors authorised to process Personal Data have committed themselves to
                    confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security
                    appropriate to the risk associated with the processing of Personal Data;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Obtain the prior specific or general authorization of the Controller before engaging another
                    Processor;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Assist the Controller in the fulfilment of the Controller's obligation to respond to requests for

                    Make available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
                    obligations laid down in the GDPR and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections,
                    conducted by the Controller or another auditor mandated by the Controller;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a Controller;
                  </li>
                  <li>Cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks;</li>
                  <li>
                    Ensure that any person acting under the authority of the Processor who has access to Personal Data
                    does not process Personal Data except on instructions from the Controller; and
                  </li>
                  <li>Notify the Controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach.</li>

                <h5 class="w-700"><span>2.1</span> Types of data / Privacy policy scope</h5>
                <p>
                  <b>“Personal Data”</b> means any information about an individual from which that person can be
                  identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
                </p>
                <p>
                  We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Data about you which we have
                  grouped together below. Not all of the following types of data will necessarily be collected from you
                  but this is the full scope of data that we collect and when we collect it from you:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 3rem">
                  <li>
                    Profile/Identity Data: This is data relating to your first name, last name, gender, date of birth.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Contact Data: This is data relating to your phone number, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Marketing and Communications Data: This is your preferences in receiving marketing information and
                    other information from us.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Billing Data: This is information relating to your debit and credit card information such as the
                    name attached to your payment details and your billing address.

                  <li>Financial Data: These are your banking details e.g. your account number and sort code.</li>
                  <li>
                    Transactional Data: This is information of details and records of all payments you have made for our
                    services or products.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your
                  race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political
                  opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor
                  do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offenses.
                </p>
                <h5 class="w-700"><span>2.2</span>The Legal Basis for Collecting That Data</h5>
                <p>
                  There are a number of justifiable reasons under the GDPR that allow collection and processing of
                  Personal Data. The main avenues we rely on are:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 3rem">
                  <li>
                    <b>“Consent”</b>: Certain situations allow us to collect your Personal Data, such as when you tick a
                    box that confirms you are happy to receive email newsletters from us, or ‘opt in’ to a service.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>“Contractual Obligations”</b>: We may require certain information from you in order to fulfil our
                    contractual obligations and provide you with the promised service.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>“Legal Compliance”</b>: We’re required by law to collect and process certain types of data, such
                    as fraudulent activity or other illegal actions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>“Legitimate Interest”</b>: We might need to collect certain information from you to be able to
                    meet our legitimate interests - this covers aspects that can be reasonably expected as part of
                    running our business, that will not have a material impact on your rights, freedom or interests.
                    Examples could be your address, so that we know where to deliver something to, or your name, so that
                    we have a record of who to contact moving forwards.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="s-30 w-700"><span>3.</span> HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h4>
                <h5 class="w-700"><span>3.1</span> Our data uses</h5>
                <p>We will only use your Personal Data when the law allows us to.</p>
                <h5 class="w-700"><span>3.2</span> Marketing and content updates</h5>
                <p>
                  You will receive marketing and new content communications from us unless you specifically request that
                  you would not like to receive these communications. From time to time we may make suggestions and
                  recommendations to you about goods or services that may be of interest to you.
                </p>
                <h5 class="w-700"><span>3.3</span> Change of purpose</h5>
                <p>
                  We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably
                  consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
                  purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible
                  with the original purpose, please contact us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain
                  the legal basis which allows us to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance
                  with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
                </p>

                <h4 class="s-30 w-700"><span>4.</span> YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW YOU ARE PROTECTED BY US</h4>
                <h5 class="w-700"><span>4.1</span> Your legal rights</h5>
                <p>
                  Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to
                  your personal data:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 3rem">
                  <li>
                    <b>Right to be informed.</b> You have a right to be informed about our purposes for processing your
                    personal data, how long we store it for, and who it will be shared with. We have provided this
                    information to you in this policy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Right of access.</b> This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you
                    and to check that we are lawfully processing it (also known as a "data subject access request"). See
                    section 4.5 below for more details on how you can make a data subject access request.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Right to rectification.</b> You have a right to request correction of the personal data that we
                    hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
                    corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Right to erasure.</b> You have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there
                    is no good reason for us continuing to process it, where you have successfully exercised your right
                    to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or
                    where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we
                    may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will
                    be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Right to object.</b> You can object to the processing of personal data we hold about you. This
                    effectively allows you to stop or prevent us from processing your personal data. Note that this is
                    not an absolute right and it only applies in certain circumstances, for example:
                    <ol type="i">
                      <li>Where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
                      <li>
                        Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something
                        about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as
                        you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In some cases, we may continue processing your data if we can demonstrate that we have
                        compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and
                        freedoms.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Right to restrict processing.</b> You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of
                    their personal data. Note that this is not an absolute right and it only applies in certain

                <h5 class="w-700"><span>4.3</span> How Learna AI Ltd protects customers' Personal Data</h5>
                <p>
                  We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. Any
                  Personal Data collected by us is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special
                  access rights to such systems and are bound by obligations of confidentiality. If and when we use
                  subcontractors to store your data, we will not relinquish control of your Personal Data or expose it
                  to security risks that would not have arisen had the data remained in our possession. However,
                  unfortunately no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may
                  be possible for third parties not under the control of Learna AI Ltd to intercept or access
                  transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Data, we
                  cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us. Any such transmission
                  is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please
                  contact us.

                  you marketing messages by clicking the unsubscribe button..
                </p>

                  Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, we will continue to retain other Personal

                  You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
                  However, if your request is clearly unfounded, we could refuse to comply with your request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure you
                  have the right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a
                  security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
                  receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to
                  speed up our response.

                <p>
                  All uses of the word "including" mean "including but not limited to" and the enumerated examples are
                  not intended to in any way limit the term which they serve to illustrate. Any email addresses set out
                  in this policy may be used solely for the purpose for which they are stated to be provided, and any
                  unrelated correspondence will be ignored. Unless otherwise required by law, we reserve the right to
                  not respond to emails, even if they relate to a legitimate subject matter for which we have provided
                  an email address. You are more likely to get a reply if your request or question is polite, reasonable
                  and there is no relatively obvious other way to deal with or answer your concern or question (e.g.
                  FAQs, other areas of our website, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our staff are not authorised to contract on behalf of Learna Ltd, waive rights or make representations
                  (whether contractual or otherwise). If anything contained in an email from a Learna Ltd address
                  contradicts anything in this policy, our terms or any official public announcement on our website, or
                  is inconsistent with or amounts to a waiver of any Learna AI Ltd rights, the email content will be
                  read down to grant precedence to the latter. The only exception to this is genuine correspondence
                  expressed to be from the Learna AI Ltd legal department.
