We do not solicit or knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. If we nevertheless discover that we have received personal information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or that we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 18, we will promptly delete such information from our systems. Additionally, a child’s parent or legal guardian may request that the child’s personal information be corrected or promptly deleted from our files by contacting us.

<b>7. Your Rights and Choices</b>

Your Content. To keep your personal, company, and/or billing information accurate and up to date, you can log in any time to update your information, via www.withAlleo.com.&nbsp; If you wish to contact us regarding viewing, modifying, or deleting your data, please <a href="https://withalleo.com/contact/">contact us</a>.

Your Email. Each mass marketing email sent from Alleo will contain an opt-out link that will allow you to stop receiving emails. Personal emails from employees will not contain an opt out link, but you may contact us and request to be opted out from all. Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days to process your request. Please also note that if you opt out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may continue to send you emails regarding billing, or your account status, as these are informational and not available for automatic opt-out. If you do not wish to receive any service-related emails from us, you have the option to deactivate your account.

Your Cookies. You may also refrain from providing or may withdraw your consent for cookies. Your browser’s help function should contain instructions on how to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time.

Third Party Data.&nbsp; While Alleo receives data from various third party sources, use of that data is not a feature of the Alleo product.&nbsp; Alleo restricts use of Third Party Data to the purposes of providing access to the platform or meeting technical integration requirements enabling the application to work. &nbsp; Data is not used, sold or shared beyond these purposes.

<b>8. Privacy Support</b>

We reserve the right to amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time upon prior notice to you by email, and by thereafter posting amended terms on this website.
