This pixel is integrated into the code of our platform. On the one hand, this allows us to ensure that the Facebook ads we initiate are only displayed to those Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our offer. In this way, we want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the respective user and do not annoy him. On the other hand, this allows us to track the actions of Facebook users after they have seen or clicked on one of our Facebook ads. This helps us measure the conversion of the respective campaign for statistical, market research and billing purposes. The following information is processed during the deployment:</p>
