In this way, we want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the respective user and do not annoy him.

The following information is processed during the deployment:\n\n\nTimestamp,\n\n\nURL,\n\n\ncampaign-related information (especially specification of the impression, form field, activated button).\n\n\nThe data collected in this way is anonymous for us and therefore does not allow us to draw any conclusions about the identity of the respective user. If you log into your Facebook account after activating the pixel or if you visit our website while logged in, it is possible that this data will be stored and processed by Facebook, which we would like to inform you about here.
