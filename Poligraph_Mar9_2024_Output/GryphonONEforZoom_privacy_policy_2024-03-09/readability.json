Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>\n<p><strong>Request that we stop using your information</strong>:&nbsp;In some cases, authorized client administrators or other designated client organization personnel, may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using, and otherwise processing information where you believe we don\u2019t have the appropriate rights to do so.&nbsp; For example, if you believe a Services account was created for your organization without permission, you can request that we delete such account as provided in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.&nbsp; If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Opt-out of&nbsp;communications:</strong>&nbsp;You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe and/or opt-out link within each email, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.&nbsp; Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding Gryphon\u2019s&nbsp;Services if you or your organization remains and active and authorized user of our Services.
