This information may be stored in log files. Some of the tools we use to automatically collect information about you may include:</p>\n<p>(a) <strong>Cookies</strong>. A \u201ccookie\u201d is a small data file transmitted from a website to your device\u2019s hard drive.&nbsp; Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways, and we may use either (or both) of them:</p>\n<p>(1) session cookies, which do not stay on your device after you close your browser, and</p>\n<p>(2) persistent cookies, which remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser\u2019s settings.&nbsp; However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Website\u2019s features or lose access to some functionality.</p>\n<p>(b) <strong>Google Analytics</strong>.

Links provided in our emails and, in some cases, on third-party websites may include tracking technology embedded in the link.&nbsp; The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system.&nbsp; The redirection system allows us to understand how the link is being used by email recipients.&nbsp; Some of these links will enable us to identify that you have personally clicked on the link and this may be attached to the Personal Information that we hold about you.&nbsp; This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>(e) <strong>Third-party Websites and Services</strong>.
