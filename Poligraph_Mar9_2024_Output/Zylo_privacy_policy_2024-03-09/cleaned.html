<h2>General</h2>
<p>We know that your privacy is important to you, and we work hard to earn and keep your trust.&nbsp; Zylo, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, “Zylo,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your privacy through our compliance with this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”).</p>
<p>This Policy describes:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The types of information we collect from you or that you may provide when you visit our website available at: https://zylo.com/, as well as any websites and blogs directly owned by Zylo (collectively, our “Website”).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Policy applies to information we collect on this Website or in emails and other electronic messages between you and this Website, and information gathered when you interact with our advertising on third-party websites if such advertisements include links to this Policy.</p>
<p>This Policy does not apply to information collected by us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Zylo or any third party, or information collected by any third party through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from the Website (for further information, see below, “Third-party Websites”).</p>
<p>Please read this Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.&nbsp; If you do not agree with our policies and practices, then please do not use our Website.&nbsp; By using our Website, you agree to the terms of this Policy.&nbsp; This Policy may change from time to time (see below, “Changes to this Policy”).&nbsp; Your continued use of our Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates.</p>
<h2>Website Terms of Use; Other Agreements</h2>
<p>This Policy should be read in conjunction with any applicable Terms of Use, into which this Policy is incorporated by reference.</p>
<h2>What We Collect and How We Collect It</h2>
<p>As part of the Zylo services, we store customer financial data as well as customer employee utilization information.&nbsp; To ensure that we provide you with the best possible experience, we will store, use, and share personal information about you in accordance with this Policy.&nbsp; Personal information is information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular user, household or device (“Personal Information”). In particular, the Website may collect the following categories of Personal Information from users of the Website:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="lazy-hidden alignnone wp-image-16982" src="//zylo.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://zylo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/privacy-table-3-scaled.jpg" alt="the Website may collect the following categories of Personal Information from users of the Website; A real name, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name and Browsing history, search history, information on a consumer's interaction with a website, application, or advertisement." width="614" height="2045"><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16982" src="https://zylo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/privacy-table-3-scaled.jpg" alt="the Website may collect the following categories of Personal Information from users of the Website; A real name, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name and Browsing history, search history, information on a consumer's interaction with a website, application, or advertisement." width="614" height="2045" /></noscript></p>
<p>We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed above from the following categories of sources:</p>
<p><strong>Directly from you</strong>. For example, when you:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">register yourself with the Website;</li>
<li aria-level="1">place an order;</li>
<li aria-level="1">subscribe to one of our e-newsletters;</li>
<li aria-level="1">review or comment on one of our products;</li>
<li aria-level="1">interact with our live chat feature;</li>
<li aria-level="1">submit a job application; or</li>
<li aria-level="1">communicate with us, such as request information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indirectly from you</strong>. For example, through information we collect from you in the course of providing our services to you.</p>
<p><strong>Directly and indirectly from activity on our Website</strong>. For example, from Website usage details that are collected automatically. For more information on automatic information collection, please review the “Automated Information Collection” section below.</p>
<p>Often, Zylo collects information under the direction of its clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Information it processes.&nbsp; Zylo collects third party information when a customer connects an integration to our platform.&nbsp; This information is retained for the life of the contract, even if the integration is disconnected.</p>
<p>The information that you provide in each case will vary. In some cases, you may be able to provide Personal Information via email or free text boxes, such as contacting Zylo to request further information.&nbsp; When providing your Personal Information, please provide only relevant information and do not provide unnecessary sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card information or other sensitive personal data, unless required for our services.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may ask you to create a username and password that should only be known to you.&nbsp; When you provide this information to us, you are no longer anonymous.&nbsp; Moreover, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us. Likewise, we may provide you with the opportunity to use integration services by logging into your existing tools. This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information to use with Zylo.</p>
<h2>Automated Information Collection</h2>
<p>In addition to the information that you provide to us, we may also collect information about you during your visit to our Website.&nbsp; We collect this information using automated tools that are detailed below.&nbsp; These tools may collect information about your behavior and your computer system, such as your internet address (IP Address), the pages you have viewed, and the actions you have taken while using the Website. This information may be stored in log files. Some of the tools we use to automatically collect information about you may include:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(a) <strong>Cookies</strong>. A “cookie” is a small data file transmitted from a website to your device’s hard drive.&nbsp; Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways, and we may use either (or both) of them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(1) session cookies, which do not stay on your device after you close your browser, and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(2) persistent cookies, which remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.</p>
<p>Of course, if you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser’s settings.&nbsp; However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Website’s features or lose access to some functionality.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(b) <strong>Google Analytics</strong>. The Website sends aggregated non-Personal Information to Google Analytics for the purpose of providing us with the ability to conduct technical and statistical analysis on the Website’s performance.&nbsp; For more information on how Google Analytics supports the Website and uses information sent from the Website, please review Google’s privacy policy available at<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites"> https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(c) <strong>Web Beacons</strong>. A Web Beacon is an electronic image.&nbsp; Web Beacons can track certain things from your computer and can report activity back to a web server allowing us to understand some of your behavior.&nbsp; If you choose to receive emails from us, we may use Web Beacons to track your reaction to our emails.&nbsp; We may also use them to track if you click on the links and at what time and date you do so.&nbsp; Some of the third-party marketers we engage with may use Web Beacons to track your interaction with online advertising banners on our Website.&nbsp; This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your Personal Information.&nbsp; Please note that any image file on a webpage can act as a Web Beacon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(d) <strong>Embedded Web Links</strong>. Links provided in our emails and, in some cases, on third-party websites may include tracking technology embedded in the link.&nbsp; The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system.&nbsp; The redirection system allows us to understand how the link is being used by email recipients.&nbsp; Some of these links will enable us to identify that you have personally clicked on the link and this may be attached to the Personal Information that we hold about you.&nbsp; This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(e) <strong>Third-party Websites and Services</strong>. We work with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology.&nbsp; These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing campaigns we are contracting them to provide.&nbsp; The information collected can be gathered on our Website and also on the websites where our marketing communications are appearing.&nbsp; For example, we may collect data where our banner advertisements are displayed on third-party websites.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(f) <strong>Behavioral Targeting and Re-Targeting</strong>. We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Website or to manage our advertising on other websites.&nbsp; Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Website and other websites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.&nbsp; If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out by sending an email to privacy@zylo.com.&nbsp; Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.&nbsp; You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

<h2>Your Choices and Selecting Your Privacy Preferences</h2>
<p>We want to provide you with relevant information that you have requested. When possible, we will always provide options as to what information we collect and how you can manage any preferences that pertain to such information.</p>
<p>If we provide subscription-based services, such as email newsletters, we will allow you to make choices about what information you provide at the point of information collection or at any time after you have received a communication from us while you are subscribed.&nbsp; Transactional or service-oriented messages, such as delivery confirmation messages, are usually excluded from such preferences, as such messages are required to respond to your requests or to provide goods and services, and are not intended for the purposes of marketing.</p>
<p>We will not intentionally send you email newsletters and marketing emails unless you consent to receive such marketing information.&nbsp; After you request to receive these emails, you may opt out of them at any time by selecting the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email.&nbsp; Please note that by opting out or unsubscribing you may affect other services you have requested we provide to you, in which email communication is a requirement of the service provided.</p>

You may exercise each of your rights as identified below, subject to our verification of your identity.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access</strong>.&nbsp; You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months.

In your request, please explain how you wish us to prohibit the sharing of your Personal Information, and which categories of third parties you want to prohibit from receiving your Personal Information.&nbsp; When such prohibitions are not possible to provide our services to you, we will advise you accordingly.&nbsp; You can then choose to exercise any other rights under this Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Portability</strong>.&nbsp; Upon request and when possible, we can provide you with copies of your Personal Information.&nbsp; When such a request cannot be honored, we will advise you accordingly.&nbsp; You can then choose to exercise any other rights under this Policy</li>
<li><strong>Deletion</strong>.&nbsp; You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.&nbsp; Where applicable, we will ensure such changes are shared with trusted third parties.</li>
<li><strong>Opt-out of Processing</strong>. You have the right to request that we do not sell your Personal Information, use your Personal Information for Targeted Advertising, or use your Personal Information for profiling. Where applicable, we will ensure such changes are shared with trusted third parties.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong>. If a California, Colorado, or Virginia data subject exercises his or her rights under applicable state law, including the CCPA, CPA, and VCDPA, we shall not discriminate against that resident by denying our goods or services, charging different prices or rates to similarly situated consumers, providing a different level or quality of our goods or services, or taking any other adverse action.</li>
<li><strong>Exercising your rights</strong>. If you are a California, Colorado, or Virginia resident who chooses to exercise the rights listed above, you can:</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Submit a request via email at privacy@zylo.com; or</li>
<li aria-level="1">Call us at 1-877-888-1030 to submit your request.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your Personal Information.&nbsp; If an authorized agent makes a request on your behalf, we may require proof that you gave the agent permission to submit the request.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to Your Request</strong>. Upon receiving your request, we will confirm receipt of your request by sending you an email confirming receipt. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the Personal Information. In some instances, such as a request to delete personal information, we may first separately confirm that you would like for us to in fact delete your personal information before acting on your request.</p>
<p>We will respond to your request within forty-five (45) days. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process Personal Information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.</p>
