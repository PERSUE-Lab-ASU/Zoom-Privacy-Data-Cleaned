Our collection, use, and disclosure practices with respect to Content are distinct from those with respect to other sorts of information, as explained in <a href="#_82lbn1u6c89z">Section 2.a</a>. below.</p>
        <p>We may upload Content automatically with your authorisation from third-party services (such as from your Google Drive). See <a href="#_vyv9zgmjkl7f">Section 1.c</a>. below.</p>
        <h3>b. Customer Information</h3>
        <p>â€œCustomer Informationâ€ consists of information related to your access or use of our Service, the creation of accounts, or that otherwise identifies you as a customer or end user of the Service. Customer Information includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Identifiers</em>. This includes your name, business mailing address, email address, postal code, telephone number, and other similar identifiers.</li>
            <li><em>Customer Records</em>. This includes username and password, payment information, company name, job title, business email address, and department.</li>
            <li><em>Commercial Information</em>. This includes information about products or services purchased, obtained or considered.</li>
            <li><em>Internet/Network Activity Information</em>. This includes your browsing history, log and analytics data, information about the device(s) used to access the Service, domain server, search history and information regarding your interaction with our Service, and other usage data.</li>
            <li><em>Audio/Visual Information</em>. This includes pictures you provide or upload in connection with our Service, and the content and audio or video recordings of phone or video calls between you and us that we record where permitted by law.</li>
            <li><em>Profession/Employment Information</em>. This includes your current employer, title, and location.</li>
            <li><em>Other Personal Information</em>. This includes personal information you provide to us in relation to a survey, comment, question, request, or inquiry, and information you provide when you connect a third-party account, product or service to the Service.</li>
            <li><em>Inferences</em>. This includes inferring your location using your IP address, or using data from your use of our Service to make predictions about your preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behaviour, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are an end user using the Service through an account created on your behalf by an Paytia customer (such as an employer, an organisation of which you are a member, or another individual), we may collect and process Customer Information about you on behalf of the Paytia customer with whom your use of the Service is associated.</p>
        <h3>c. Third-Party Integrations</h3>
        <p>If you create your account using a service provided by a third party such as Google or Apple, or a single-sign-on service provided by a third party such as Google or Microsoft, we may collect Customer Information about you from the third-party service (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service). If you create your account using such a third-party service, or if you give us permission by changing the settings on your Paytia account, we may also collect, and you authorise us to collect, information about your personal contacts as may be stored within that third-party service, which we may use to facilitate your invitation of collaborators to Paytia. By choosing to create an account using a third-party service, you also authorise us to collect Customer Information necessary to authenticate your account with the third party.</p>
        <p>Certain aspects of Paytia allow you to link or integrate third-party products and services to enable certain features and functionalities with Paytia. For example, you can connect your Google account to sign into Paytia from information and data contained in your Google account or integrate with third-party services using Paytia extensions. If you choose to use these features or functionalities, you may be asked to create an account with a third party that provides such features or functionalities or link your existing third-party service account with Paytia (and, by doing so, agree to the privacy policy and/or terms and conditions of that third party). You may also be asked to authorise Paytia to collect information from the third party on your behalf. We will then collect information (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service) from you and/or that third party as necessary to enable Paytia to access your data and content stored with that third-party service. Once the authentication is complete, we have the ability to access information you provided to us or was otherwise collected by the third-party service in accordance with the privacy practices of that third party. We will store the information and data we collect and associate it with your Paytia account, and we will use that information and data to enable the integration of Paytia with the third-party service and to perform actions requested or initiated by you, or that are reasonably necessary to carry out instructions provided by you.</p>
        <h3>d. Automatically-Collected Information</h3>
        <p>We collect information about how you use Paytia and your actions on Paytia, which can include your IP addresses, browser types, operating systems, ISPs, platform types, device types, and mobile device identifiers such as make and model, and mobile carrier. We may also use tools, including third-party tools, to collect analytics data. Some of this information is collected through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, session replay scripts, and similar technologies. Please see our <a href="https://www.paytia.com/privacy-cookies-policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more information about our use of cookies and similar tracking technologies.</p>
        <h2>2. How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>a. Use of Content</h3>
        <p>Paytia; where you (or the organisation through which you have an account) explicitly approve access (e.g. during a customer support inquiry); in response to lawful requests by law enforcement or government authorities; in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process or requests, as required by applicable law in each country/jurisdiction as determined in our discretion; where necessary (in our sole discretion) to ensure the stability and security of Paytia and our systems (e.g. where we have reason to believe specific Content is degrading server stability); and where necessary (in our sole discretion) to protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of you, us, or others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that we may retain, take possession of, delete, or deny you access to your Content if we believe, in our sole discretion, that some or all of your Content, or your use of Paytia, violates our <a href="https://accounts.pay729.net/terms_conditions">Terms of Service</a>.We also may analyse metadata related to Content (such as total number of records, file size, API volume, access logs, etc.).</p>
        <h3>b. Use of Other Information</h3>
        <p>We use the information we collect for a variety of purposes, and how we use it depends on what we collect and which Service (or features of the Service) you use. These purposes may include:</p>
