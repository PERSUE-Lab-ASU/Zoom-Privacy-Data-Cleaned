If you choose to use these features or functionalities, you may be asked to create an account with a third party that provides such features or functionalities or link your existing third-party service account with Paytia (and, by doing so, agree to the privacy policy and/or terms and conditions of that third party). You may also be asked to authorise Paytia to collect information from the third party on your behalf. We will then collect information (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service) from you and/or that third party as necessary to enable Paytia to access your data and content stored with that third-party service. Once the authentication is complete, we have the ability to access information you provided to us or was otherwise collected by the third-party service in accordance with the privacy practices of that third party. We will store the information and data we collect and associate it with your Paytia account, and we will use that information and data to enable the integration of Paytia with the third-party service and to perform actions requested or initiated by you, or that are reasonably necessary to carry out instructions provided by you.</p>\n        <h3>d.

Some of this information is collected through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, session replay scripts, and similar technologies.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that we may retain, take possession of, delete, or deny you access to your Content if we believe, in our sole discretion, that some or all of your Content, or your use of Paytia, violates our <a href=\"https://accounts.pay729.net/terms_conditions\">Terms of Service</a>.We also may analyse metadata related to Content (such as total number of records, file size, API volume, access logs, etc.).</p>\n        <h3>b.
