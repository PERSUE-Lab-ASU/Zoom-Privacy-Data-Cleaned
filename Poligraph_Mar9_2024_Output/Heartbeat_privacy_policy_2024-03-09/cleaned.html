The Company may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.<br><br>The Company reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. The Company will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. Also, users should be aware that the Company may sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through the Company’s site. The Company are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and users should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable information.<br><br>Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas of the Company’s sites, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of the Company.<br><br>Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of the Company’s internet servers or through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files a web site can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Users should be aware that the Company cannot or does not control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for the Company. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Company’s site.<br><br>Users that choose to connect their Google account will provide Heartbeat access to their Google Calendar. Heartbeat only uses Google Calendar data to sync event data between Heartbeat &amp; the user's Google Calendar. Heartbeat does not access, modify or store any Google Calendar event data that was not created via Heartbeat. Upon leaving Heartbeat, the user's integration with Google is discarded and Heartbeat does not maintain access to the user's Google Calendar. Heartbeat does not share any Google Calendar data with third parties.<br><br>Upon request, the Company will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, the Company will use reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups and records of deletions.<br><br>We retain your personal data for enough time to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We aim to remove unused personal data quickly and efficiently to protect user privacy. The length for which we retain any personal data depends on the type of data and the purpose for which we process that data.<br><br>The foregoing policies are effective as of <strong>January 1, 2021</strong>.
