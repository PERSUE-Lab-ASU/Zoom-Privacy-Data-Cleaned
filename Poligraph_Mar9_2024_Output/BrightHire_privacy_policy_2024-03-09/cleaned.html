					<p>BrightHire’s mission is to elevate the human elements of hiring by providing new visibility, data and analytics for hiring through solutions designed to, among other things, manage and streamline the recruiting process, including capturing, transcribing and making accessible hiring conversations.</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal information of our business contacts, their employees and other representatives of our prospective and existing customers in connection with our websites and services (collectively, our “services”). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice does not apply to personal information about authorized users of our services and job applicants that we process on behalf of our customers. We process this information on behalf of recruiting platforms and companies, as instructed by them, in our capacity as a service provider/data processor.</p>
<p><em>Our website is designed for businesses and is not intended for personal or household use. Accordingly, we treat all personal information covered by this Privacy Notice, including details about site visitors, as pertaining to individuals acting as business representatives (rather than in their individual capacity).</em></p>
<p>We provide additional information for European residents below.</p>
<p><strong>Our Collection of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Information You Provide</em></strong></p>
<p>We collect the following personal information you provide in connection with our services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact Information,</strong>&nbsp;such as name, email address, mailing address, or phone number.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional Information,</strong>&nbsp;such as the name of your employer, your title and business responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Information,</strong>&nbsp;such as account credentials, billing information, payment information and other information used to administer your account, include the services you have purchased or may be interested in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event Information,</strong>&nbsp;such as event attendance, dietary restrictions and travel accommodations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support Information,</strong>&nbsp;such as the content of requests or correspondence we may receive from you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feedback Information,</strong>&nbsp;such as information shared with us to provide feedback on our services or to participate in an optional survey.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to contact us, we may need additional information to fulfill your request or respond to your inquiry. We may provide additional privacy disclosures where the scope of the inquiry/request and/or personal information we require fall outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy disclosures will govern how we may process the information you provide at that time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Information Automatically Collected</em></strong></p>
<p>As is true of most digital platforms, we collect certain personal information automatically when you visit our online services, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log File Data,</strong>&nbsp;including your internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser id, date/time of visit, and pages visited.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analytics Data,</strong>&nbsp;including the electronic path you take to our services, through our services and when exiting our services, as well as your usage and activity on our services, such as the links and objects you view, click or otherwise interact with (also known as “Clickstream Data”).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location Data,</strong>&nbsp;including your general geographic location based on your IP address or more precise location when accessing our online services through a mobile device.</li>
</ul>
<p>For information about our and our third-party partners’ use of cookies and related technologies to collect information automatically, and any choices you may have in relation to its collection, please visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://brighthire.com/cookie-notice/?__hstc=753710.ec7041de4a42f77a6ba735daa0bea522.1740548830561.1740548830561.1740548830561.1&amp;__hssc=753710.1.1740548830561&amp;__hsfp=3618309378">Cookie Notice</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Information from Other Sources and Third Parties</em></strong></p>
<p>We also obtain personal information from other sources, which we often combine with personal information we collect either automatically or directly from you.</p>
<p>We receive the same categories of personal information as described above from the following sources and third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employers:</strong>&nbsp;We may receive certain information about you in connection with your employer’s interest in or use of our services. For example, your employer may provide us with your contact information and account information to allow us to set up an account for you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Media:</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to interact with us or otherwise post on social media, we may collect personal information you chose to make public or share directly with us. For example, if you choose to send us a question through social media, we may collect the personal information you provide and other personal information from your publicly available account to provide a response to your question.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information Providers:</strong>&nbsp;We may from time to time obtain information from third-party information providers to correct or supplement other personal information we collect. For example, we may obtain updated contact information from third-party information providers to reconnect with you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
