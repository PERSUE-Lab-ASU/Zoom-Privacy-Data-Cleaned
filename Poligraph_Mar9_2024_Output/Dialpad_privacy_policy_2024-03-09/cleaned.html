Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications, which include, but are not limited to, Dialpad Ai Meetings, Dialpad Ai Voice, Dialpad Ai Contact Center, Dialpad Ai Sales Center, and Dialpad Digital Engagement (the “Services”) that you order directly through our website. For the avoidance of doubt, if you order services through a Master Service Agreement with us, any such services are governed by the terms of the Master Service Agreement and not these online terms. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at&nbsp;<a class="text-dp-purple font-semibold hover:underline" href="mailto:customersuccessteam@dialpad.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customersuccessteam@dialpad.com</a>&nbsp;or write us at 3001 Bishop Dr., Suite 400A, San Ramon, CA 94583.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Dialpad, Inc. (“Dialpad,” “we” and “us”). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. Your use of the Services and our website constitutes your agreement with and to be bound by all terms and conditions included in these Terms as well as the terms outlined in the Acceptable Use Policy, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Dispute Policy, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">MODIFICATIONS AND UPDATES TO TERMS</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them by discontinuing your use of the Services; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective and serves as your acceptance of and agreement with any such changes.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">SERVICE REGISTRATION PROCEDURES</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Upon signing up for the Services and at subsequent times as requested by Dialpad, you agree to provide Dialpad with your true, accurate, current, and complete personal name and/or business name, administrator name, billing address, shipping address, the addresses where the Services will primarily be used, 911 registered address for each applicable device, email address, contact phone number, credit card information, and other data which may be necessary to administer your Dialpad account (“Account”) (collectively, “Registration Data”).

We will notify you before any Services you are currently using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">If you choose to sign up for any Services that carry a fee (the “Paid Services”) you will be charged the then current fees for such Paid Services. Dialpad’s current fees for the Paid Services can be found at&nbsp;<a class="text-dp-purple font-semibold hover:underline" href="https://dialpad.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dialpad.com/pricing/</a>. Unless otherwise agreed, all fees paid to Dialpad are non-refundable.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Unless you are paying for the service pursuant to an invoicing arrangement with Dialpad or one of our authorized resellers (“Reseller”), as described in the following paragraphs, any applicable initiation charges, usage, monthly recurring charges, support charges, and other fees are billed in full in advance. Termination, international calling, equipment return fees, and transfer charges, if any, are billed in arrears. Upon termination of your Account for any reason, all unused calling credits and international calling credits shall expire in their entirety on the termination date. No refund, transfer, or proration shall be made of any unused calling credits, additional credits, promotional credits, or international calling credits or of any remaining periods/months on any account.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">When you subscribe to Services, you will provide us with a valid payment method, such as a valid credit card (including proper billing information), and, if applicable, authorize us to collect from your payment method. Any authorization will remain valid until thirty (30) days after you terminate our authority to charge your payment method. Upon termination, we will charge you any fees and any other outstanding charges and disconnect your Services. You agree to advise and notify us of any changes to your payment method, such as credit card account number or expiration date changes. If the credit card or other payment method on your Account is declined or fails for any reason, Dialpad will use reasonable efforts to contact you and advise you of the failed billing attempts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dialpad reserves the right to disconnect your Services and terminate your Account if your credit card on file is declined or fails for any reason, and Dialpad reserves the right to continue to attempt charging your credit card for any outstanding Services charges and additional fees and pursue any other legal remedies available to Dialpad.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Time is of the essence for payment. Therefore, you agree to pay us interest at the lesser rate of (a) 18% per annum or (b) the highest rate allowed by law for any amounts unpaid as of the due date. Acceptance of late or partial payments (even if marked “Paid in Full”) shall not waive any of Dialpad’s rights to collect the full amount due. We may assess an additional fee of the lesser of (a) fifty dollars ($50) or (b) the highest amount allowed by law for any credit card chargeback or check returned for nonpayment.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Billing cycle end dates may change from time to time. When a billing cycle covers less than or more than a full month, we may make reasonable adjustments and prorate the charges to your Account.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">You must dispute any charges for the Services in writing to Dialpad within thirty (30) days of the date of the charge by Dialpad. If you fail to provide a written statement explaining in reasonable detail your reasons for disputing the charge within such time period, you irrevocably waive any objection and further recourse with regard to such charges. Written statements disputing charges must be sent to&nbsp;<a class="text-dp-purple font-semibold hover:underline" href="mailto:customersuccessteam@dialpad.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customersuccessteam@dialpad.com</a>.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">PRODUCT PRICING AND AVAILABILITY</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">With respect to its advertising, offering, or sale of Services, Dialpad attempts to describe its products as accurately as possible. Nevertheless, Dialpad does not warrant that any descriptions, pricing, availability, or other information relating to the advertising, offering, or sale of Services (collectively, “Service Information”) from its website, marketing materials, promotional flyers, advertisements, or other printed or electronic materials (collectively, “Service Materials”) is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Despite our efforts, it is possible that Service Information may be mispriced or described inaccurately, or that the Services may be unavailable. In the event Dialpad determines that a Service is mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, Dialpad reserves the right to take any action it deems reasonable and necessary to rectify the error, including without limitation, canceling your Account or subscription to the Services. You agree to notify Dialpad immediately if you become aware of any pricing or descriptive errors or inconsistencies with any Services you order through the Service Materials and comply with any corrective action taken by Dialpad. You acknowledge and agree that the Services may not be available 100% of the time. Credit allowances for interruption of the Services may only be provided on a case-by-case basis at the sole discretion of Dialpad and shall be your sole remedy for any Service interruptions or other issues with the Services.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">TAXES, CHARGES, AND FEES</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">All fees for Services advertised or otherwise listed on the website are exclusive of any federal, state, local sales, international excise, value-added, and similar taxes or fees and administrative or recovery fees or charges (collectively “Taxes and Fees”). For subscribers of Dialpad Paid Services, you agree to pay all Taxes and Fees and/or similar liabilities, however denominated, that may now or hereafter be levied on the Services, which are chargeable to or recoverable from customers by any federal, state, local, or international law or regulation, as well as any administrative and recovery fees and charges levied on the Services by Dialpad, whether or not mandated by law or regulation. Should Dialpad pay or be required to pay such liabilities (including any Taxes and Fees that were due but not charged or previously collected), You agree that Dialpad may invoice you or charge your credit card on file for such payments upon receipt of an invoice and showing of indebtedness to Dialpad.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">You are responsible for paying all charges for your Account, including but not limited to toll-free, local, long distance, international, additional feature charges, 411 and operator assisted charges, and directory assistance charges, and for all taxes, surcharges, and fees imposed on you or us as a result of your use of the Service.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">DISCOUNTS</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">From time to time in its sole discretion, Dialpad may offer promotions or discounts. Any promotion or discount code must be provided to Dialpad upon purchase of the Services. You shall not be entitled to a subsequent credit for such promotions or discounts if you do not request such credit at the time of account creation or change of service. Promotions and/or discounts may not be used cumulatively or be used for Services retroactively. If a promotion and/or discount is offered on a confidential basis, you agree not to disclose the promotion and/or discount and to assume full responsibility for any harm, direct or indirect, caused to Dialpad by the disclosure of the promotion and/or discount.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">UNLIMITED CALLING</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Dialpad offers unlimited monthly calling for domestic calls (United States and Canada) from your mobile phone or computer. An unlimited service provides you with a domestic telephone number and is subject to the terms and restrictions of Dialpad’s Acceptable Use Policy, along with any other restrictions described herein, as well as any reseller agreements, if applicable. If, for any reason, Dialpad believes that you are using the unlimited service for a prohibited purpose and/or your call usage violates Dialpad’s Acceptable Use Policy, then Dialpad may, in its sole discretion, with or without notice, terminate your unlimited service.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">TOLL-FREE CALLING</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Dialpad offers toll-free numbers for an additional monthly fee, plus additional charges based on the minutes of use for inbound calls. Having a toll-free number requires that you maintain a balance of calling credits. When you are nearing exhaustion of your initial paid allotment of calling credits, we will automatically recharge on your behalf an incremental package for additional credits, unless you disable this feature otherwise. Post-paid pricing packages and other variable terms may be available through invoiced accounts or resellers. Please refer to any applicable reseller agreements for additional terms of service. If, for any reason, Dialpad believes that you are using the toll-free calling for a prohibited purpose and/or your call usage violates Dialpad’s Acceptable Use Policy, then Dialpad may, in its sole discretion, with or without notice, terminate your toll-free calling service.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">INTERNATIONAL CALLING AND “LOCAL” INTERNATIONAL TELEPHONE NUMBERS</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">To make international calls using the Services, you must enable international calling in your settings and pre-purchase at least the minimum package of international calling credits necessary to make such international calls. Insufficient credits may cause your call to be terminated. Packages of international calling credits will diminish based on the rate defined per country and carrier. Our international calling rates are available at&nbsp;<a class="text-dp-purple font-semibold hover:underline" href="https://www.dialpad.com/rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.dialpad.com/rates/</a>. In addition, you may be charged any applicable Taxes and Fees associated with international calls.

Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, Internet Connection Failure, Number Flexibility &amp; Porting, and Loss of Electrical Power (as described below):</p><ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-left"><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3"><u class="underline">Internet connection failure.</u> If the connection to the wired broadband internet over which your Dialpad Service is provided is interrupted, you would not have access to Dialpad Service during that interruption and therefore will not have access to Dialpad 911 Service during that interruption.</p></li><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3"><u class="underline">Number Flexibility &amp; Service Portability.</u> Traditional 911 service automatically sends your 911 call to the appropriate local emergency responder, or Public Safety Answering Point (“PSAP”), based on your telephone number. Traditional Enhanced 911 service (also known as E911) automatically sends your 911 call to the appropriate PSAP along with your registered address and telephone number. Because the Dialpad Service permits you to obtain a telephone number that does not correspond to your geographic location (for example, you may obtain a Dialpad telephone number with a California area code even if you do not have a California address) and allows you to use Dialpad Service anywhere you have wired broadband Internet, the Dialpad 911 Service functions differently than traditional 911 service in certain respects: Because your address does not necessarily correspond with your telephone number, you must provide Dialpad with the street address(es) where you will be using Dialpad Service (“Registered Location(s)”) when you sign up for Dialpad service. If you relocate any equipment (e.g., PC with softphone, IP phone, or ATA with traditional phone) that you use to access the Dialpad Service, you must update your Registered Location(s). If you do not update your Registered Location(s), any 911 calls you make using the Dialpad Service will be routed based on your previously provided Registered Location and therefore may not be routed to the appropriate PSAP for your new location. In addition, because the Dialpad Service will, where possible, automatically transmit your Registered Location to the PSAP, you must update your Registered Location to ensure that the Dialpad Service transmits accurate location information to the PSAP. Once you notify us of a change in your Registered Location, there may be a delay in making the new Registered Location available to properly route 911 calls and advise PSAPs of your new Registered Location. In some parts of the country where direct routing to PSAPs is not available for Dialpad 911 Service, the Service will route your call to the National Emergency Call Center where trained agents will ask for the name, location, and telephone number of the person calling 911 and will contact the appropriate PSAP to send help. The call center will not automatically receive your address and telephone number. In these situations, public safety response times may be delayed. As a result, there may be an additional delay before emergency services arrive.</p></li><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3"><u class="underline">Loss of Electrical Power.</u> Unless you have a backup system to power your wired broadband Internet connection and any equipment (PC with softphone, IP phone, ATA with traditional phone) that You use to access your Dialpad Service, you will not have phone service or 911 service during any power outage.</p></li></ul><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3"><u class="underline">Registration of Physical Locations Required.</u>&nbsp;As discussed above, you must register the Registered Location where you will be using Dialpad Service for each phone line you use from Dialpad (e.g., if you purchase Dialpad with three lines, you must provide a Registered Location for each of the three lines). Dialpad will obtain your Registered Location as part of the service initiation process and will not provide Dialpad Service until you have provided your initial Registered Location. However, you must update your Registered Location when you use your Dialpad Service from a new location. Regardless of what address you register, in some circumstances, such as unavailability of direct routing to PSAPs or the use of portable devices to access the Dialpad Service, emergency calls will be routed to the National Emergency Call Center.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3"><br>You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete Registered Location information to Dialpad as part of the service initiation process and to update as soon as possible your Registered Location with true, accurate, current, and complete information whenever you use your Dialpad Service from a new location. If you provide Registered Location information that is, or that Dialpad suspects to be, false, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, Dialpad has the right to suspend or terminate the Services and refuse any and all current or future use of all Services, or any portion thereof. Dialpad will not, however, disable your ability to make a 911 call during any service suspension.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">You may update your Registered Location by logging on to your account settings page or contacting Dialpad customer support at&nbsp;<a class="text-dp-purple font-semibold hover:underline" href="mailto:customersuccessteam@dialpad.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customersuccessteam@dialpad.com</a>. For purposes of 911 dialing, you may only register one Registered Location for each Dialpad line.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3"><u class="underline">Notify All Users of 911 Limitations.</u>&nbsp;You must inform all business colleagues, household residents, guests, and other persons who may be present at the physical location where you utilize the Dialpad Service that 911 may not be available or may be in some way limited in comparison to traditional 911 service. For subscribers to whom E911 service is provided as part of their Dialpad Services, stickers may be sent with warning that “E911 Service May Be Limited or Not Available” for use with any equipment purchased from Dialpad. It is your responsibility to place these stickers on the equipment you use to access Dialpad Service. If you have not received a sticker, or you require additional 911 stickers, please contact customer support at&nbsp;<a class="text-dp-purple font-semibold hover:underline" href="mailto:customersuccessteam@dialpad.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customersuccessteam@dialpad.com</a>.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3"><u class="underline">Disclaimer of 911 Liability.</u>&nbsp;Dialpad disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of PSAPs, the National Emergency Call Center, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. Dialpad does not have any control over PSAPs, the National Emergency Call Center, or other third parties and is therefore not responsible for whether they answer 911 calls made using the Dialpad Service, how they answer these calls, or how they handle or respond to these calls. Dialpad relies on third parties to assist it in the provision of 911 service and disclaims any and all liability for acts or omissions by third parties in the provision of Dialpad’s 911 service. Dialpad expressly disclaims all liability with respect to your use of the E911 service. You hereby agree to fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, hold harmless, and fully indemnify Dialpad from and against any damages or liabilities of any kind related to your use of the E911 services.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">Operator Assisted Calling, 311, 511, and Other X11 Calling</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">The Service does not support 0+ or operator assisted calling (including, without limitation, collect calls, third party billing calls, 900, or calling card calls). The Service may not support 311, 411, 511, and/or other X11 calling (other than 911 and 711 as specified in this Agreement) in one or more service areas.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">Fraudulent Activity or Erroneous Changes</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">In the event of suspected fraudulent activity or erroneous charges on your Account, you agree to contact Dialpad as soon as possible. In many cases, Dialpad can mitigate or correct fraudulent activity or erroneous charges without bank or credit card company intervention. If you suspect fraudulent activity or erroneous charges on your Dialpad account, please contact Dialpad customer support at&nbsp;<a class="text-dp-purple font-semibold hover:underline" href="mailto:customersuccessteam@dialpad.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customersuccessteam@dialpad.com</a>. When you contact customer support, please have the following information available: (a) your name, contact information, the Dialpad account telephone number in question, and security verification information; (b) the credit card account number associated with the account; and (c) the total amount in question charged to the account. If you do not contact Dialpad within thirty (30) days after the suspected fraudulent activity or erroneous charges appear on your Account, you waive your rights to object to or challenge such activity or charges. Furthermore, if you request that your bank or credit card company perform a chargeback without first contacting Dialpad, and Dialpad subsequently determines that the charges at issue are not erroneous, Dialpad reserves the right to terminate your account immediately and take any available legal action. Notwithstanding the above, you are solely liable for any transactions or activities by you or anyone else that occur on your Account, and in no event shall Dialpad be liable for any unauthorized use of your Account.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">AUP Breach</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">In the event that you breach any of the terms of this AUP, Dialpad retains the right to suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the Dialpad Services (including Dialpad Ai Meetings) upon written notice to you.

Your API clients</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">a. The APIs are designed to help you enhance your websites and applications ("API Client(s)"). YOU AGREE THAT DIALPAD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE DIALPAD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include Dialpad accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect Dialpad or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Dialpad may use any technical means to overcome such interference. Dialpad may suspend access to the APIs by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">b. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personal data, from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">c. Dialpad does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">6. User privacy and API clients</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">a. You will comply with (1) all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personal data and (2) the Dialpad Privacy Policy and&nbsp;<a class="text-dp-purple font-semibold hover:underline" href="https://www.dialpad.com/dialpad/gdpr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Processing Agreement</a>, which governs your use of the APIs when you request access to Dialpad user information. You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your API Client that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information (including for advertising) with Dialpad and third parties.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">b. Unless otherwise specified in writing by Dialpad, Dialpad does not intend use of the APIs to create obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended ("HIPAA"), and makes no representations that the APIs satisfy HIPAA requirements. If you are (or become) a "covered entity" or "business associate" as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the APIs for any purpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information to Dialpad unless you have received prior written consent to such use from Dialpad.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">7. Confidentiality</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">a. Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">b. Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Dialpad confidential information. Dialpad confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you may not disclose it to any third party without Dialpad's prior written consent. Dialpad confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose Dialpad confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">8. Content</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">a. Our APIs may contain third party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content. Content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">b. Some of our APIs allow the submission of content. Dialpad does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in the Terms.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">c. For the sole purpose of enabling Dialpad to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and only in accordance with the applicable Dialpad privacy policies, you give Dialpad a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to Use content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. "Use" means use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">d. When a user's non-public content is obtained through the APIs, you may not expose that content to other users or to third parties without explicit opt-in consent from that user.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">e. Dialpad supports data portability. For as long as you use or store any user data that you obtained through the APIs, you agree to enable your users to export their equivalent data to other services or applications of their choice in a way that's substantially as fast and easy as exporting such data from Dialpad products and services, subject to applicable laws, and you agree that you will not make that data available to third parties who do not also abide by this obligation.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">d. Unless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law, you will not, and will not permit your end users or others acting on your behalf to, do the following with content returned from the APIs:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-left"><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Scrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of such content, or keep cached copies longer than permitted by the cache header;</p></li><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Copy, translate, modify, create a derivative work of, sell, lease, lend, convey, distribute, publicly display, or sublicense to any third party;</p></li><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Misrepresent the source or ownership; or</p></li><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of material.</p></li></ul><h3 class="h3 mb-4">9. Brand features; Attribution</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">a. "Brand Features" is defined as the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of each party. Except where expressly stated, the Terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party's Brand Features. All use by you of Dialpad's Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) inures to the benefit of Dialpad.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">b. Dialpad hereby grants to you a nontransferable, nonsublicenseable, nonexclusive license while the Terms are in effect to display Dialpad's Brand Features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the APIs. You must only use the Dialpad Brand Features in accordance with the Terms and for the purpose of fulfilling your obligations under this Section.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">c. You will not make any statement regarding your use of an API that suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by Dialpad without Dialpad's prior written approval.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">d. In the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the APIs you are using and the associated Dialpad products, Dialpad may produce and distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, video, or other content from your API Client, and may use your company or product name. You grant us all necessary rights for the above purposes.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">10. Privacy and copyright protection</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">a. By using our APIs, Dialpad may use submitted information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">b. We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but we can't determine whether something is being used legally or not without their input. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Dialpad's policy about responding to notices in our&nbsp;<a class="text-dp-purple font-semibold hover:underline" href="https://www.dialpad.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help Center</a>.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">11.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH THE APIS, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE APIS, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE APIS "AS IS.” SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

IN ALL CASES, DIALPAD, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXPENSE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.</p><h3 class="h3 mb-4">12. Indemnification</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">Unless prohibited by applicable law, if you are a business, you will defend and indemnify Dialpad, and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and users, against all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, fees (including legal fees), and expenses relating to any allegation or third-party legal proceeding to the extent arising from:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-left"><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">your misuse or your end user's misuse of the APIs;</p></li><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">your violation or your end user's violation of the Terms; or</p></li><li><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">any content or data routed into or used with the APIs by you, those acting on your behalf, or your end users.</p></li></ul><h3 class="h3 mb-4">13. General provisions</h3><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">a. We may modify the Terms or any portion to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our APIs. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will post notice of modifications to the Terms within the documentation of each applicable API, to this website, and/or in the Dialpad developers console. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. But changes addressing new functions for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for an API, you should discontinue your use of that API. Your continued use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">b. The APIs were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency supplements thereto.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">d.

If you are accepting the Terms on behalf of a United States federal government entity, then the following applies instead of the paragraph above: the laws of the United States of America, excluding its conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the APIs. Solely to the extent permitted by United States Federal law: (i) the laws of the State of California (excluding California's conflict of laws rules) will apply in the absence of applicable federal law; and (ii) FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE APIS, THE PARTIES CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE COURTS IN SAN FRANCISCO CITY AND COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.</p><p class="paragraph white-space-normal mb-3">f.
