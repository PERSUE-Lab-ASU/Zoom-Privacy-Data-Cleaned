For example, we may engage Service Providers to provide services such as marketing, advertising, communications, infrastructure and IT services, to provide customer service, and to analyze and enhance data (including data about users' interactions with our service). These Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information in order to provide these functions. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. We require our Service Providers to agree to take reasonable steps to keep the personal information that we provide to them secure. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services. The data transfers are limited to what is strictly necessary for providing the service, and we pay a great deal of attention to supplementary security measures (legal, technical and organizational) implemented by our Service Providers. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Authorised Third Parties</h3> <p> We share data with third parties when the transfer has been authorised directly and explicitly by you, the user. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Affiliates</h3> <p> We may disclose your information to current or future affiliates or subsidiaries for research, marketing, and other purposes consistent with this Privacy Notice. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Business Transfers</h3> <p> We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Notice. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if we sell or transfer a business unit or assets to another company, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy proceeding, or as part of any other similar business transfer, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Law enforcement, government and regulatory agencies or to other third parties as required by, and in accordance with applicable law or regulation </h3> <p> Within the limits of the applicable laws, we share your personal data to authorities, law enforcement and government agencies upon their request in order to prevent criminal activities, meet national security requirements or respect law enforcement injunctions. Such requests will be fulfilled only where we are permitted to do so in accordance with applicable law or regulation. </p> </li> </ul> <p> We may transfer your data to third parties in countries outside the European Economic Area. Such transfer will only occur if: </p> <ul> <li> the country to which the personal data is sent to falls under a Commission adequacy decision; or </li> <li> in absence of such decision, under an agreement compliant with EU requirements regarding the transfer of personal data to data controllers or data processors outside the EEA (e.g., standard contractual clauses approved by the Commission). For those transfers, a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) is made by Wooclap. In order for this data transfer to occur, this assessment should demonstrate that the data transfers are limited to what is strictly necessary, and protected by appropriate supplementary measures (legal, technical and organizational) as described by <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the European Data Protection Board</a>. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h2>Subprocessors</h2> <p> In order to comply with the provisions set forth by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we require our subprocessor to have in place a Data Processing Agreement with us.
