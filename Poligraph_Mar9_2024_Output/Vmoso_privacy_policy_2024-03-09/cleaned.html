<h5>This policy is effective as of July 9, 2019.</h5>

<p>This Privacy Statement applies to <a href="http://www.vmoso.com" style="color:blue;" target="_blank">www.vmoso.com</a>
owned and operated by BroadVision, Inc.("BroadVision", "us","our" or "we").
This Privacy Policy covers and describes how BroadVision collects, uses and discloses information we collect when You
use our product at our service, Vmoso. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the
purpose of providing the service for which You have engaged BroadVision.</p>

<p>We value Your privacy, and want to help make Your experience with Vmoso as satisfying and safe as possible.
We have established this Privacy Policy to explain how Vmoso collects Personal Information (as defined below),
and how Vmoso uses and discloses that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you
regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information. Our default privacy
settings limit the Personal Information displayed in Your Profile to Your Contacts and You control the Contacts with
whom You share the Personal Information through the privacy settings on the Edit Profile page. "Personal Information,"
as used in this Privacy Policy, is information that allows a person to directly identify an individual, such as the
individual's name or email address, and information that we combine directly with such identifying information.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Vmoso Terms &amp; Conditions ("Agreement"). Any capitalized
terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Agreement. By using Vmoso, You expressly consent to the
information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h5>1. How Vmoso Operates</h5>

<p>Vmoso provides a platform ("Vmoso Platform") that enables registered users ("Vmoso Members") to share tasks,
files, chats, comments and profiles through the various Vmoso Websites and Applications on the Vmoso Platform.</p>

<h5>2. Collection of Personal Information</h5>

<p>We collect information for our Customers, if You are a client of one of our Customers and would no longer like
to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our service, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly.</p>

<p>Personal Information You Provide, Vmoso Member Data. (1) You must register for a Vmoso ID, as defined in the Agreement,
to become a Vmoso Member. When You register for a Vmoso ID, You are required to provide certain information, including
Your name, email address ("Personal Information" and a password that You select. You also may provide other
Personal Information within Your Vmoso Profile, such as Your photo, company, and job title. You may choose not
to display some of this information, causing it not to be displayed to some of Your Vmoso Contacts. Please note,
however, that even if You choose not to display Personal Information in Your Vmoso Profile, that information will
be accessible by Vmoso. Although we allow You to set privacy options that limit access to Your Vmoso Profile,
please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users
with whom You may choose to share Your Vmoso Profile and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee
that Personal Information You post on Your Vmoso Profile will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not
responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Vmoso website.
(2) You also may have other opportunities to voluntarily provide Personal Information to Vmoso. For example,
if You contact us to provide feedback or request support we collect Your email address and other Personal Information
that You provide. Vmoso collects information under the direction of its Customers, and has no direct relationship with
the individuals whose personal data it processes.</p>

<p>You can import contacts from your Outlook or other email account address book to invite them to become members of our website. We collect the username and password for the email account from which you wish to import your contacts, and will only use your personal information for that purpose.</p>

<h5>3. Passive Data Collection</h5>

<p>A. Like most web-based services, Vmoso automatically receives and records information on our server logs
from Your browser when You use Vmoso Platform. Vmoso may use a variety of methods, including clear GIFs
(also known as "web beacons"), and "cookies" to collect this information. The information that Vmoso collects
with these automated methods may include, for example, Your IP address, Vmoso cookie information, a unique device or
user ID, browser type, system type, the content and pages that You access on the Vmoso Platform, and the
"referring URL" (i.e., the page from which You navigated to the Vmoso Platform).</p>

<p>B. We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve Vmoso Platform and our other
services and systems, and to provide services and content that are tailored to You, this may include providing
customized advertisements and monitoring and reporting of the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. If we directly
combine any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, we treat the combined information
as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we use information collected by passive means in
 aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms.</p>

<p>C. Websites visited before visiting Vmoso or a Network might place Personal Information within the URL
of Your browser during a visit to that previous website. Vmoso may unintentionally collect that information
as part of referring URL information that it collects.</p>

<p>D. Also, please be aware that third parties may set cookies, gifs or use other means of passively collecting
information about Your use of their services. We do not have access to, or control over, these cookies or other
means of passive data collection. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties
advertising servers or advertising networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the
activities of, such other advertisers or websites. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose
of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" style="color:blue;" target="_blank">here</a>
(or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" style="color:blue;" target="_blank">here</a>).
Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

<h5>4. Content and Use of Networks</h5>

<p>A. When You post, transmit or send Content, as defined in the Agreement, on the Vmoso Platform,
Your Contacts may access any Personal Information within such Content. We collect and maintain Content
that You have posted or transmitted in Vmoso as well as information about that Content and Your interaction
with it. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information You choose to submit in this Content.</p>

<p>B. Because You may voluntarily disclose Personal Information when You post or otherwise transmit Content,
please be careful with the information that You choose to disclose.</p>

<h5>5. Information Received From Third-Party Sources</h5>

<p>We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third-party sources. This includes certain
Personal Information that may be provided to us through the installation and use of Vmoso Applications on third party
web sites. If we directly combine information from other third parties with Personal Information that we collect
on the Vmoso Platform, we will treat the combined information as 'Personal Information' and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h5>6. How Vmoso Uses Personal Information</h5>

<p>We may use Personal Information to operate, provide, improve, and maintain the Vmoso Platform, and our other
services and systems, and to develop new products and services; to prevent abusive and fraudulent use of the Vmoso
Platform and our other services and systems and other content on the Vmoso Platform; to send You administrative
messages, and information about content, and Vmoso services in which we believe You may be interested; and for other
administrative and internal business purposes.</p>

<h5>7. When Personal Information may be Disclosed</h5>

<p>A. BroadVision is not in the business of renting or selling email addresses and other information, and does
not share Personal Information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy
Policy. Please be aware, however, that any information that You voluntarily choose to display on any publicly
available portion of the Vmoso Platform becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by Vmoso or
others without restriction.</p>

<p>B. Vmoso Service Providers. We may provide Personal Information to third parties for their use in
performing internal business functions (including but not limited to payment processing, maintenance, security,
data analysis, or data hosting) on our behalf. These third party providers are restricted from using this data in
any way other than to provide services for Vmoso. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions
in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Customers and suppliers.</p>

<p>C. Data Retention. We will retain Your information for as long as Your account is active or as needed to
provide You services. If You cancel the account or request that we no longer use Your information to provide
You services contact us at <a href="mailto:support@broadvision.com">support@broadvision.com</a>.
We will retain and use Your information as necessary to
comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>D. BroadVision Affiliates. Vmoso may share some or all of Your Personal Information with its affiliates, in
which case we will seek to require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. You may, at any time, opt
out of having Your Personal Information shared with our affiliates by contacting us via email at
<a href="mailto:vmoso-opt-out@broadvision.com">Vmoso-opt-out@broadvision.com</a>.</p>

<p>E. Legal Requirements. We may disclose Personal Information if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is required
by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order or otherwise required by law. Additionally, we may disclose
Personal Information where we, in good faith, deem it appropriate or necessary to prevent violation of the
Vmoso Agreement, or our other agreements; take precautions against liability; protect the rights, property,
or safety of Vmoso, any individual, or the general public; maintain and protect the security and integrity of
our services or infrastructure; protect ourselves and our services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses;
investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; or assist government enforcement agencies.</p>
