When You do this, the third party shares with us certain information through their Application Program Interface (API). We do not control what information such third party may provide us, and we do not control whether such information is encrypted. We may store the information provided by such third party on our own site, to facilitate the login process, and to link our site to the third party site in accordance with their API.

This information is only used to verify credit card authenticity, make charges that You have authorized, and issue invoices as per Your service agreement.
