This privacy policy explains how we process your personal information in service of that mission.</p>\n<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<p>We hope you will read this entire privacy policy. However, if you\u2019re in a hurry, here are the key points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keybase won\u2019t sell or rent your data or content for any reason.</li>\n<li>By design, Keybase can\u2019t access, sell, transmit, or use your encrypted content.</li>\n<li>We use a public blockchain to protect our users from <a href=\"https://keybase.io/docs/sigchain#footnote-1-pgp-key-servers-and-lying-by-omission\">misbehaving servers</a>. Because of that, you can\u2019t delete your publicly announced account information and account activity once you post it to your signature chain. You can, however, revoke it. Revoking, in Keybase, means retracting the original statement, indicating that it\u2019s no longer true, or that the information has changed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"our-business-model\">Our Business Model</h3>\n<p>We\u2019ll never run an ad-supported business. And Keybase will never sell your data.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we plan to offer a paid service and extra features for corporate teams, primarily. Until then, we're building a product to bring public keys to the masses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-personal-information-do-we-collect-\">What personal information do we collect?</h3>\n<p><em>Contact and account information</em>: We collect the information you provide to us, such as your name, avatar picture, email address, and social media handles. Note: Keybase never requires a phone number and no longer requires an email address in order to open and maintain an account.</p>\n<p><em>Team names and membership</em>: If you create or join a team on Keybase, we collect and store the names of the teams and subteams, their membership, and when they were formed.</p>\n<p><em>Hashed password</em>: We collect and store information about your Keybase password that allows you to prove you know your password; that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching\">\u201cstretched\u201d</a> password is sent to Keybase\u2019s servers.  See <a href=\"https://keybase.io/docs/api/1.0/call/login\">here</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><em>Account activity</em>: We collect information about your activity while using the Services, such as proving you control a certain Twitter username, announcing your public key, editing your biographical information, or editing any of your social media usernames. Some of this information is aggregated, summarized, and published into the Bitcoin blockchain in order to detect and guard against certain vulnerabilities. See \u201cDisclosures to your signature chain, the Merkle tree, and the Bitcoin blockchain\u201d below for information on how we treat this data.</p>\n<p><em>Files and Data</em>. We collect and store files and information that you transmit to other parties using Keybase or that you elect to store on the Services.  This data is always encrypted on our servers, except for documents in your public folder and your public chats.  Those are not encrypted because you choose to make those publicly accessible.</p>\n<p><em>Do Not Track</em>. Keybase does not collect personally identifiable information from you to track you across third-party websites. As a result, Keybase does not specifically respond to web browser Do Not Track signals.</p>\n<p><em>Unique personal identifiers</em>. We collect and store information to identify you, such as your Keybase user ID and your IP address (which is stored only temporarily).</p>\n<p><em>Network usage and activity</em>. We collect certain technical and analytics data, for example the type of device you\u2019re using to access our Services or the operating system you\u2019re running. Keybase is designed to store the minimum amount of technical data for the shortest time necessary in order for you to have the Services across all the devices you add.</p>\n<p><em>Interactions with us</em>: If you email us, we may keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to the request and otherwise follow up as necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-we-use-your-information-\">How do we use your information?</h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s how we use your information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide the Services to you on all the devices you add.</li>\n<li>To protect our Services and users. For example, we will use it to investigate suspicious activity and attacks.</li>\n<li>To improve Keybase for all our users. For example, we will make development decisions based on what features our users are using.</li>\n<li>To communicate with you about Keybase. You can unsubscribe from those messages (unless they are specifically about your account, and then we have to send them to you).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"disclosures-to-your-signature-chain-the-merkle-tree-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain\">Disclosures to your signature chain, the Merkle tree and the  Bitcoin blockchain</h3>\n<p><strong>How and why do we use your signature chain, the Merkle tree and the Bitcoin blockchain?</strong></p>\n<p>Every Keybase account has a public signature chain (called a sigchain), which is an ordered list of statements about how the account has changed over time.  <a href=\"https://keybase.io/docs/sigchain\">Meet the sigchains!</a> Specifically, we announce into your sigchain your Keybase username, when you add a public key, additions or changes to your identity proofs (Twitter, Github, your website, etc.), public bitcoin address announcements, public follower statements, and device additions and revocations. The list of statements grows over time as you change and add to your account.</p>\n<p>Every time you add to or change data in your sigchain, those changes are aggregated with the data that everyone else on Keybase adds or changes. Those aggregated changes are summarized (aka \u201chashed\u201d) into the root of Keybase\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree\">Merkle tree</a>.</p>\n<p>Every 12 hours, that summary/hash in the Merkle tree gets published into the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n<p>We do this to increase the security of your information. It helps us to detect whether our servers have been compromised and are lying by omission or have been forked.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I delete information from my sigchain?</strong></p>\n<p>No. For your protection from, and detection of, hackers and other undesirable intrusions into the Services, it is not possible to delete data from your sigchain, or to change the hashes/summaries in the Merkle tree and the Bitcoin blockchain. If you want to alter information that you have provided, the previously provided information cannot be deleted and can only be revoked.</p>\n<p>For example, if you change your Twitter username, your old Twitter username will not be deleted from your sigchain.  Instead, you will append a new statement to your sigchain, revoking the old Twitter username.  Nobody is able to  retroactively change the hashes into the Merkle tree and Bitcoin blockchain: the fact that the hashes cannot be changed is the essence of this security feature.  All of this means that <em>people will be able to discover your old Twitter username by looking at your sigchain.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Where can I find out more?</strong></p>\n<p>For a technical explanation of how Keybase supports \u201crevocations\u201d instead of \u201cdeletions\u201d, how they are chained together, and how they are hashed into the Merkle tree and Bitcoin blockchain, please read our paper documentation about our <a href=\"https://keybase.io/docs/server_security\">server security</a> and how we use the Bitcoin blockchain to <a href=\"https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/merkle_root_in_bitcoin_blockchain\">improve security</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The content of your chat messages and private files is end-to-end encrypted.

If we sell, merge, reorganize, enter bankruptcy, or transfer any part of our business, we may be required to share your information before and after such an event.
