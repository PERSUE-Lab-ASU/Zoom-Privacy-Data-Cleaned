Billing Policy and Payment</span></span></h2>\n\n\n\n<div><p>Use of GENESIS DIGITAL products and services (including but not limited to WebinarJam, EverWebinar, and Kartra) constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to comply with this section.</p><p>\n&nbsp;\nAll accounts are set up on a prepaid basis. Payment must be received by GENESIS DIGITAL before any billable product or service is provided/activated. In the event of a trial period, payment information must be on file before Client\u2019s account is created. Client is required to keep a valid credit/debit card on file to charge for recurring monthly subscription fees. All recurring subscriptions are automatically invoiced and charged to the credit/debit card on file.</p><p>\n&nbsp;\nTrial subscriptions are limited to one trial per person, per product. The purchase and subsequent cancellation of multiple trials may result in permanent closure of the account. If it is determined that any Client fails to pay the agreed upon monthly or annual payments by exploitation of any self-billing feature, all associated accounts may be terminated immediately, without warning, and Client will be billed for all unpaid usage.</p><p>\n&nbsp;\nSubscription billing is based on the availability of products and services within the parameters defined by Client\u2019s package(s). Certain fees may be usage-based (e.g.WebinarJam/EverWebinar for Mass Market events).</p></div>\n\n<p><br>\nPayment receipts are provided electronically with each purchase and may also be provided upon Client\u2019s request.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n<strong><span><span>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Billing Cycle:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div><p>Credit/Debit Card Billing: All credit/debit cards are automatically charged on the Client\u2019s specific billing cycle date.</p><p>\n&nbsp;\nPayment failure: In the event a credit/debit card fails to charge successfully, access to the product will immediately cease.</p><p>\n&nbsp;\nDeactivation: GENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to remove Client application data from its servers after nonpayment.</p><p>\n&nbsp;\nCancellation: Cancellation of a subscription immediately stops automatic subscription billing. If there is time remaining in a subscription period, access to the service will remain open until the end of the prepaid billing cycle.</p></div>\n\n<p><strong><span><span>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fees:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collections Fee: In the event an account is submitted to a third-party collections service, a $35.00 processing fee may be assessed to the existing account balance. This fee is in addition to any other fees previously assessed on the account.</p>\n\n<div><p>Chargebacks: If a customer initiates a chargeback, GENESIS DIGITAL may assess a $50.00 processing fee for each individual chargeback.</p><p>\n\nInterest: Any charges not paid when due are subject to interest at a rate equal to the lesser of: (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowed by applicable law.</p><p>\n&nbsp;\nGENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to increase subscription pricing at the time of renewal.</p></div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n<strong><span><span>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Payment Methods:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GENESIS DIGITAL accepts payments from most major credit cards, and in some cases, PayPal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;4.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Subscription Billing:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invoices are generated and payments are collected at the beginning of each billing period. Client billing periods typically begin on the day of the month (or year for yearly plans) in which the Client purchases the GENESIS DIGITAL subscription. Clients must request to cancel their subscriptions at least 10 days prior to their next billing date to avoid being charged on the billing date. GENESIS DIGITAL will not prorate any portion of unused subscription services. All subscription fees are nonrefundable except as described below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span><span>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Account limits:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Kartra package or plan comes with limits on certain areas of asset creation and &nbsp;resources consumption as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong><span><span>(a)</span></span></strong> Unlimited features:.

An upgrade to the next plan level is required once account limits are met. The features currently offered on an unlimited basis are: emails, bandwidth, pages, videos, products, membership sites, help desks, Funnel Mappers.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span><span>4.7&nbsp; &nbsp; Excessive Use of \u201cUnlimited\u201d Plans:&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Client\u2019s excessive use of \u201cunlimited\u201d plans may cause a degradation in the service(s) GENESIS DIGITAL provides. Unauthorized or excessive use beyond that normally experienced by business customers may lead to account throttling, suspension, or termination. Unlimited shall never be shared with any other independent or separate account, individual or user. For this reason, GENESIS DIGITAL may consider a Client\u2019s use to be \u201cexcessive,\u201d in GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019s sole discretion, when considering the following categories of use:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(a) Unreasonable number of requests to our servers, (b) Volume of page views, (c) Volume of video views, (d) Video streaming bandwidth consumed, (e) Number of Videos uploaded per day, week, month, etc., (f) Number of emails sent per day, week, month, etc. &nbsp;This list is non-exhaustive and GENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to determine Client\u2019s excessive use of unlimited plans at any time, for any reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, unlimited plans cannot, under any circumstances, be used for providing a video service, email service, or other high volume or multi-person video or email purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GENESIS DIGITAL further reserves the right to withdraw or change any unlimited feature at any time. If GENESIS DIGITAL makes any change(s) to an unlimited feature, Client will receive a notification describing the change(s) to the relevant unlimited feature and the date such changes take effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span><span>4.8&nbsp; &nbsp; Package Upgrade/Downgrade:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GENESIS DIGITAL subscriptions are purchased on a fixed-term basis: monthly, yearly, or bi-yearly, depending on the plan Client registers for. When an account is upgraded to a higher tier, the system will run a one-off pro-rated charge for the remaining days of the current billing period. Thereafter, the standard fees for Client\u2019s newly upgraded package will become effective. Overages are charged based on the package subscription active at the time the overages are incurred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Account downgrades require communication with GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019S support portal to ensure Client\u2019s account assets are reduced below package requirements. Account downgrades will go into effect the following billing cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span><span>4.9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Limitations During Trial Periods:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it relates to WebinarJam, during the trial period, trial users will experience certain limitations. Access to the API and automation features will not be available to trial users. Additionally, there is a maximum of 500 email invitations that can be sent from the registration pages during the trial period.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span><span>4.10&nbsp; &nbsp; Refund Policies:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div><p>Refunds only available to new customers on the following terms and must be requested within 30 days of the commencement of a subscription.&nbsp;</p><p>\n&nbsp;\nKartra usage overage fees are non-refundable.</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div><p>Trial payments are non-refundable.</p><p>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\nRefunds will not be given for unused or partially used subscriptions.</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span><span>4.11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cancellation Process:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a cancellation request: A request to cancel a GENESIS DIGITAL Product must be initiated at least 10 days prior to the next invoice date. For Kartra users, cancellation can also be done via the Billing Profile self-service portal in Client\u2019s Account. Any other request to cancel a GENESIS DIGITAL Product must be made via the customer support portal with a GENESIS DIGITAL representative at least 10 days prior to the next invoice date. Clients are encouraged to keep records of all communications regarding cancellation. Until a cancellation request is made, or a cancellation processed via the self-service portal, GENESIS DIGITAL will continue to treat Client\u2019s Account as an open account. Unless canceled, the billing cycle will continue, possibly resulting in a past due account that may be turned over to a third-party collection service. It is imperative to contact a GENESIS DIGITAL representative, utilize the self-service option, or submit an online ticket if Client wishes to initiate cancellation of its GENESIS DIGITAL account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cancellation of an account does not dismiss outstanding invoices or nullify previously agreed charges. At the time of cancellation, any outstanding balance must be settled. All canceled accounts with an outstanding balance may be turned over to a third-party collection service.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p>Client Data may be deleted at the discretion of GENESIS DIGITAL when Client\u2019s account is closed for any reason.</p><p>\n&nbsp;\n<strong><span><span>4.12 Billing Disputes:</span></span></strong></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Client agrees to provide GENESIS DIGITAL 30 days to attempt settlement of any billing dispute before disputing with any third-party credit/debit card company or bank. Should GENESIS DIGITAL receive a chargeback from a third-party credit/debit card company or bank on the Client\u2019s behalf before GENESIS DIGITAL has been given a chance to resolve the issue, GENESIS DIGITAL may charge Client for its time spent resolving such disputes and any associated fees incurred by GENESIS DIGITAL, in addition to the $50.00 chargeback fee mentioned above. Regardless of the outcome of the chargeback, GENESIS DIGITAL retains the right to collect on any services or fees that are due. GENESIS DIGITAL may submit any disputed amounts to a collection agency. Once a chargeback has been received, GENESIS DIGITAL has the right to suspend the account until the matter is resolved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span><span>4.13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicable Taxes:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively \u201cTaxes\u201d). Client agrees to pay applicable direct or indirect Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder, which, to the extent GENESIS DIGITAL is legally required to collect the same, will be itemized on the product invoice. If Client has an obligation to withhold any amounts under any law or tax regime (other than U.S. income tax law), Client will gross up the payments so that GENESIS DIGITAL receives the amount actually quoted and invoiced. If GENESIS DIGITAL has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Client is responsible under this section, the appropriate amount will be invoiced and paid by the Client unless, prior to the invoice date, the Client provides GENESIS DIGITAL with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless otherwise indicated in writing, all fees and other charges are in U.S. dollars, and all payments shall be in U.S. currency. In no event will GENESIS DIGITAL credit, refund, or reimburse you for a foreign exchange fee charged by your credit card for any difference in fees due to currency conversion. Client understands and agrees that GENESIS DIGITAL uses dynamic marketplace pricing. Client\u2019s pricing is subject to change at the sole discretion of GENESIS DIGITAL at any time.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<strong><span><span>4.14 Subscription Ownership, Control, and Transfer:</span></span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br>\nGENESIS DIGITAL shall not be responsible for any ownership conflict between two (or more) partners, associates, staff members, customer, or managers claiming ownership or control over a GENESIS DIGITAL Product account. GENESIS DIGITAL will always regard the person or entity currently paying for the account as the sole and rightful owner (and manager) of the account.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br>\nGENESIS DIGITAL will only consider an account ownership transfer upon express written consent from both parties involved in the transaction: the current account owner and the designated account recipient. Once the transfer is approved by GENESIS DIGITAL, the transfer is non-revocable, and the recipient will become the sole and rightful owner thereafter. Moreover, from the date of transfer onwards, the account recipient will become responsible for all future payments on the account and warrants they have &nbsp;read and agreed to this Agreement and all incorporated policies. &nbsp;In the event of a transfer of an account, the recipient shall be required to purchase a new subscription at current rates.</p>\n</div>\n<div aria-controls=\"cke_1287\" aria-activedescendant=\"\" aria-autocomplete=\"list\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-component=\"text\" id=\"awHw71RJhL\">\n<h2><span><span>5.

Billing Policy and Payment\n\n\n\nUse of GENESIS DIGITAL products and services (including but not limited to WebinarJam, EverWebinar, and Kartra) constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to comply with this section.\n\u00a0\nAll accounts are set up on a prepaid basis. Payment must be received by GENESIS DIGITAL before any billable product or service is provided/activated. In the event of a trial period, payment information must be on file before Client\u2019s account is created. Client is required to keep a valid credit/debit card on file to charge for recurring monthly subscription fees. All recurring subscriptions are automatically invoiced and charged to the credit/debit card on file.\n\u00a0\nTrial subscriptions are limited to one trial per person, per product. The purchase and subsequent cancellation of multiple trials may result in permanent closure of the account. If it is determined that any Client fails to pay the agreed upon monthly or annual payments by exploitation of any self-billing feature, all associated accounts may be terminated immediately, without warning, and Client will be billed for all unpaid usage.\n\u00a0\nSubscription billing is based on the availability of products and services within the parameters defined by Client\u2019s package(s). Certain fees may be usage-based (e.g.WebinarJam/EverWebinar for Mass Market events).\n\n\nPayment receipts are provided electronically with each purchase and may also be provided upon Client\u2019s request.\n\n\u00a0\n4.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Billing Cycle:\n\n\n\nCredit/Debit Card Billing: All credit/debit cards are automatically charged on the Client\u2019s specific billing cycle date.\n\u00a0\nPayment failure: In the event a credit/debit card fails to charge successfully, access to the product will immediately cease.\n\u00a0\nDeactivation: GENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to remove Client application data from its servers after nonpayment.\n\u00a0\nCancellation: Cancellation of a subscription immediately stops automatic subscription billing. If there is time remaining in a subscription period, access to the service will remain open until the end of the prepaid billing cycle.\n\n4.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fees:\n\n\n\nCollections Fee: In the event an account is submitted to a third-party collections service, a $35.00 processing fee may be assessed to the existing account balance. This fee is in addition to any other fees previously assessed on the account.\n\nChargebacks: If a customer initiates a chargeback, GENESIS DIGITAL may assess a $50.00 processing fee for each individual chargeback.\n\nInterest: Any charges not paid when due are subject to interest at a rate equal to the lesser of: (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowed by applicable law.\n\u00a0\nGENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to increase subscription pricing at the time of renewal.\n\n\u00a0\n4.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Payment Methods:\n\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL accepts payments from most major credit cards, and in some cases, PayPal.\n\n\n\n\u00a04.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Subscription Billing:\n\n\n\nInvoices are generated and payments are collected at the beginning of each billing period. Client billing periods typically begin on the day of the month (or year for yearly plans) in which the Client purchases the GENESIS DIGITAL subscription. Clients must request to cancel their subscriptions at least 10 days prior to their next billing date to avoid being charged on the billing date. GENESIS DIGITAL will not prorate any portion of unused subscription services. All subscription fees are nonrefundable except as described below.\n\n\n\n4.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Account limits:\n\n\n\nEvery Kartra package or plan comes with limits on certain areas of asset creation and \u00a0resources consumption as follows:\n\n\n\t\n(a) Unlimited features:.

An upgrade to the next plan level is required once account limits are met. The features currently offered on an unlimited basis are: emails, bandwidth, pages, videos, products, membership sites, help desks, Funnel Mappers.\n\u00a0\n\n4.7\u00a0 \u00a0 Excessive Use of \u201cUnlimited\u201d Plans:\u00a0\n\n\n\nClient\u2019s excessive use of \u201cunlimited\u201d plans may cause a degradation in the service(s) GENESIS DIGITAL provides. Unauthorized or excessive use beyond that normally experienced by business customers may lead to account throttling, suspension, or termination. Unlimited shall never be shared with any other independent or separate account, individual or user. For this reason, GENESIS DIGITAL may consider a Client\u2019s use to be \u201cexcessive,\u201d in GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019s sole discretion, when considering the following categories of use:\n\n\n\n(a) Unreasonable number of requests to our servers, (b) Volume of page views, (c) Volume of video views, (d) Video streaming bandwidth consumed, (e) Number of Videos uploaded per day, week, month, etc., (f) Number of emails sent per day, week, month, etc. \u00a0This list is non-exhaustive and GENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to determine Client\u2019s excessive use of unlimited plans at any time, for any reason.\n\n\n\nIn addition, unlimited plans cannot, under any circumstances, be used for providing a video service, email service, or other high volume or multi-person video or email purposes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL further reserves the right to withdraw or change any unlimited feature at any time. If GENESIS DIGITAL makes any change(s) to an unlimited feature, Client will receive a notification describing the change(s) to the relevant unlimited feature and the date such changes take effect.\n\n\n\n4.8\u00a0 \u00a0 Package Upgrade/Downgrade:\n\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL subscriptions are purchased on a fixed-term basis: monthly, yearly, or bi-yearly, depending on the plan Client registers for. When an account is upgraded to a higher tier, the system will run a one-off pro-rated charge for the remaining days of the current billing period. Thereafter, the standard fees for Client\u2019s newly upgraded package will become effective. Overages are charged based on the package subscription active at the time the overages are incurred.\n\n\n\nAccount downgrades require communication with GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019S support portal to ensure Client\u2019s account assets are reduced below package requirements.

For Kartra users, cancellation can also be done via the Billing Profile self-service portal in Client\u2019s Account. Any other request to cancel a GENESIS DIGITAL Product must be made via the customer support portal with a GENESIS DIGITAL representative at least 10 days prior to the next invoice date. Clients are encouraged to keep records of all communications regarding cancellation. Until a cancellation request is made, or a cancellation processed via the self-service portal, GENESIS DIGITAL will continue to treat Client\u2019s Account as an open account. Unless canceled, the billing cycle will continue, possibly resulting in a past due account that may be turned over to a third-party collection service. It is imperative to contact a GENESIS DIGITAL representative, utilize the self-service option, or submit an online ticket if Client wishes to initiate cancellation of its GENESIS DIGITAL account.\n\n\n\nCancellation of an account does not dismiss outstanding invoices or nullify previously agreed charges. At the time of cancellation, any outstanding balance must be settled. All canceled accounts with an outstanding balance may be turned over to a third-party collection service.\n\n\n\nClient Data may be deleted at the discretion of GENESIS DIGITAL when Client\u2019s account is closed for any reason.\n\u00a0\n4.12 Billing Disputes:\n\n\n\nClient agrees to provide GENESIS DIGITAL 30 days to attempt settlement of any billing dispute before disputing with any third-party credit/debit card company or bank. Should GENESIS DIGITAL receive a chargeback from a third-party credit/debit card company or bank on the Client\u2019s behalf before GENESIS DIGITAL has been given a chance to resolve the issue, GENESIS DIGITAL may charge Client for its time spent resolving such disputes and any associated fees incurred by GENESIS DIGITAL, in addition to the $50.00 chargeback fee mentioned above. Regardless of the outcome of the chargeback, GENESIS DIGITAL retains the right to collect on any services or fees that are due. GENESIS DIGITAL may submit any disputed amounts to a collection agency. Once a chargeback has been received, GENESIS DIGITAL has the right to suspend the account until the matter is resolved.\n\n\n\n4.13\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applicable Taxes:\n\n\n\nThe fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively \u201cTaxes\u201d). Client agrees to pay applicable direct or indirect Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder, which, to the extent GENESIS DIGITAL is legally required to collect the same, will be itemized on the product invoice. If Client has an obligation to withhold any amounts under any law or tax regime (other than U.S. income tax law), Client will gross up the payments so that GENESIS DIGITAL receives the amount actually quoted and invoiced. If GENESIS DIGITAL has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Client is responsible under this section, the appropriate amount will be invoiced and paid by the Client unless, prior to the invoice date, the Client provides GENESIS DIGITAL with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise indicated in writing, all fees and other charges are in U.S. dollars, and all payments shall be in U.S. currency. In no event will GENESIS DIGITAL credit, refund, or reimburse you for a foreign exchange fee charged by your credit card for any difference in fees due to currency conversion. Client understands and agrees that GENESIS DIGITAL uses dynamic marketplace pricing. Client\u2019s pricing is subject to change at the sole discretion of GENESIS DIGITAL at any time.\n\n\n4.14 Subscription Ownership, Control, and Transfer:\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL shall not be responsible for any ownership conflict between two (or more) partners, associates, staff members, customer, or managers claiming ownership or control over a GENESIS DIGITAL Product account. GENESIS DIGITAL will always regard the person or entity currently paying for the account as the sole and rightful owner (and manager) of the account.\u00a0\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL will only consider an account ownership transfer upon express written consent from both parties involved in the transaction: the current account owner and the designated account recipient. Once the transfer is approved by GENESIS DIGITAL, the transfer is non-revocable, and the recipient will become the sole and rightful owner thereafter. Moreover, from the date of transfer onwards, the account recipient will become responsible for all future payments on the account and warrants they have \u00a0read and agreed to this Agreement and all incorporated policies. \u00a0In the event of a transfer of an account, the recipient shall be required to purchase a new subscription at current rates.\n\n\n5. Product Performance\n\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL cannot guarantee that every Product or service description on the Site is 100% accurate, complete, reliable, and/or error-free. GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible for the accuracy of any descriptions for any Product or service sold by third parties using EverWebinar or WebinarJam, or the accuracy of the description of any third-party product or service purchased via Kartra. Except as expressly provided, Client\u2019s sole recourse is from the third-party providing the Product(s)or service, or from whom you purchased the Product(s).\n\n\n\nDue to changes in technology and the marketplace, GENESIS DIGITAL may make modifications to the Products that comprise Client\u2019s Agreement, or particular components of such Product (including but not limited to discontinuing a component of the Product) from time to time.\n\n\nClient acknowledges and agrees that all features and content of the GENESIS DIGITAL Products are subject to availability of a suitable or adequate internet connection, valid email account, computer equipment and sufficiently available bandwidth at the time of Client\u2019s attempted use or access. Client shall be solely responsible for procuring the necessary computer equipment and internet connection required for accessing and using the Products. Client shall hold GENESIS DIGITAL harmless from any failure or inability to access the Products resulting from Client\u2019s failure to procure any such necessary equipment or services.\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL makes all reasonable efforts to be as accurate as possible in its descriptions including descriptions of services, options, and products offered or available on the Site(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure accuracy, however, we cannot guarantee that every product or service description on the Site is 100% accurate, complete, reliable, and/or error-free. We do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy of any descriptions for any product or service sold by third parties using EverWebinar, WebinarJam, or Kartra. Except as expressly provided, your sole recourse is from the third party providing the product or service, or from whom you purchased.\n\u00a0\n\n\n6. Product Support\n\n\n\nTechnical support and troubleshooting for reported issues that are directly related to the Product(s) purchased by Client are included as part of Client\u2019s agreement. GENESIS DIGITAL shall not be obligated to provide technical support or to cure issues regarding third-party applications, customizations, integrations with third-party applications, internet or local network connectivity, Client\u2019s local infrastructure or workstations, or issues caused by Client\u2019s users, agents, or other technology providers.

Depending on the nature of the reported technical issue, GENESIS DIGITAL may initiate further troubleshooting efforts, which may include chatting with an agent via the live chat feature, responding via e-mail to a support ticket created by Client, or in certain cases providing direct phone support, remote screen-sharing, and/or direct access into Client\u2019s database, files, Software or environment. Any support response shall be provided in GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019s sole discretion.

Aggregated and statistical non-personal information (\u201cAggregated Data\u201d) derived from the operation of the applicable Product shall be owned by GENESIS DIGITAL and nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting GENESIS DIGITAL from using Aggregated Data for business and/or operational purposes. GENESIS DIGITAL may share\u00a0Client Data, including but not limited to\u00a0Aggregated Data, with any third party in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Client hereby represents and warrants that Client has provided all necessary and appropriate notices and opt-outs, and has obtained all necessary and appropriate consents, approvals and rights to collect, process, use, store, enhance and disclose the Client Data and allows GENESIS DIGITAL to use, store, disclose and otherwise process such Client Data as contemplated by these Terms, including to and from End Users wherever required under applicable law.\n\n\n8. User Content \n\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL does not endorse any goods, services, products, promotions, or offerings (\"User Content\") provided via, distributed, submitted, or promoted with or used with any GENESIS DIGITAL Products. GENESIS DIGITAL may not agree with or condone particular claims, opinions, or viewpoints promulgated or expounded using the Products. GENESIS DIGITAL expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with goods, services, products, promotions, or offerings.\n\n\n9. External Links, Affiliate Relationships and User-Driven Marketplaces \n\n\n\n\n\n9.1 Third Party Sites: \n\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL may provide various links to external sites that provide useful resources, products, or services. In some cases, when accessing GENESIS DIGITAL Sites, hyperlinks (or \u201clinks\u201d) will direct Clients to or connect Clients with other websites that are not related to the Sites. Where such websites are third-party owned and operated, they are not prepared by, offered by, or controlled by GENESIS DIGITAL. In such cases, GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible in any way for the quality, content, nature, applicability, or reliability of third-party sites accessible by hyperlink from GENESIS DIGITAL Sites. If Client chooses to leave a GENESIS DIGITAL Site, Client should be aware that neither this Agreement nor any GENESIS DIGITAL policies apply to third-party sites. Client should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data-gathering practices, of third-party sites, regardless of whether Client followed a link from a GENESIS DIGITAL Site to get there.\n\u00a0\nUnless stated otherwise, GENESIS DIGITIAL\u2019s decision to provide links to external or third-party sites does not imply affiliation, endorsement, or adoption of those sites, any information contained therein, or any products or services offered on the third-party sites. GENESIS DIGITAL does not and cannot guarantee that the information or other material linked is accurate, current, or available. Client understands that GENESIS DIGITAL assumes no responsibility or liability for any external links or any content on such third-party sites, and Client agrees that GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible whatsoever for any actions Client takes on third-party sites, including any purchases. GENESIS DIGITAL likewise makes no claims regarding and accepts no responsibility for third-party sites that link to any GENESIS DIGITAL Sites.\n\u00a0\nEven where GENESIS DIGITAL expressly endorses a product or service (which endorsement may be based on the personal or professional opinion of one or more persons), Client understands that GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019s position or opinion on the product or service is based on those factors we have considered, and that we do not have the ability to evaluate or opine on the quality, price, advisability, suitability, need, or satisfaction that Client may experience with such products or services. Client should always do your own due diligence on any product or service prior to purchasing, to determine if it is right for you, whether or not GENESIS DIGITAL recommends it.\n\n\n\n9.2 Affiliate Offerings: \n\n\n\nIn some cases GENESIS DIGITAL or its owners may have an affiliate relationship with a third-party site or service provider mentioned on the Sites, and may be compensated (e.g., receive a valuable benefit, or even a commission) if Client visits and/or purchases a product or service from the affiliated site. GENESIS DIGITAL will generally endeavor to identify any such relationships so that you understand that even though we endorse a particular product or service, GENESIS DIGITAL also may be compensated in some way if Client chooses to do business with the recommended business or site. However, Client should assume that GENESIS DIGITAL does have such a relationship \u2013 and that GENESIS DIGITAL will be compensated if Client purchases a product or service. Where GENESIS DIGITAL has an affiliate relationship with such third- party sites, our receipt of compensation does not increase Client\u2019s cost to purchase the product or service, and if you purchase through an affiliate link, you will generally receive valuable bonuses that you would not otherwise be entitled to receive. if the possibility of GENESIS DIGITAL receiving compensation is not agreeable to Client, please do not buy through any link on the Sites.\n\n\n\nLikewise, GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019s Software, Products and services, including those that are available through the Sites may also be offered by or through third-party affiliates who are compensated by us, for example if you purchase a product or service from us. While GENESIS DIGITAL is responsible for claims we have made regarding GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019s Software, Products or services, GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible for any claims made by third parties. Moreover, those third parties may promise the inclusion of various bonuses or additional products or services. If those bonuses, products, or services are a part of GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019s offer, GENESIS DIGITAL is responsible for delivering or providing them and will do so. If the third-party affiliate has offered additional bonuses, products, or services that are not a part of GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019s offer, Client should contact the third-party directly, regarding those bonuses, products, or services.\n\u00a0\n9.3 User-Driven Marketplaces: \n\n\n\nGENESIS DIGITAL's Software, Products and services, including those that are available through the Sites enable Clients to set up various marketplaces to list, advertise, promote and sell their products and services to other users.\n\u00a0\nThe products and services in Client marketplaces are not created by, offered by, endorsed by\u00a0\nor controlled by GENESIS DIGITAL.

Client also understands that Client may not, directly or indirectly, remove any GENESIS DIGITAL proprietary notices from any Product, including copyright notices, trademark notices, or notices or markings regarding patents or patent status. Likewise, any third-party notices or markings must remain intact. Any effort to remove, replace, or obscure such marks is a violation of this Agreement, and Client\u2019s access and/or agreement may be terminated immediately without refund.\n\n\n\n11.2\u00a0Client retains all right, title, and interest in and to Client\u2019s Data, including User Content. Client is solely responsible for Client\u2019s User Content and the consequences of creating, copying, submitting, storing, distributing, publishing, selling or offering for sale any User Content using GENESIS DIGITAL Products.

GENESIS DIGITAL may terminate this Agreement and suspend Client\u2019s access to Products immediately at any time if GENESIS DIGITAL in its sole discretion, is of the opinion that Client\u2019s continued use of any GENESIS DIGITAL Product may infringe upon or cause damage to any third-party rights. Upon termination, Client shall promptly delete Client\u2019s access to and use of the applicable Product. All other obligations Client has agreed to under these Terms shall survive Termination of the agreement for any reason. If Client\u2019s account is terminated by GENESIS DIGITAL, Client is prohibited from creating any new accounts and Client agrees not to attempt to circumvent this provision by attempting to obtain a new account under a different name, email address, using a different IP address, or through any third party.\n\u00a0\nIMPORTANT: Termination for any reason, including billing End Users who have terminated with Client or where no service is being provided, and Termination for Nonpayment described below, will end ALL use of the applicable GENESIS DIGITAL Product(s). Termination will not only end Client\u2019s ability to make future sales through the GENESIS DIGITAL Software but will also impact any ongoing subscriptions or recurring payments in connection with past sales. Client understands that any and all credit card or other financial transactions that are processed through the KARTRA Software or a connected gateway will no longer be processed. Moreover, any transactions that are handled by a third-party through use of a GENESIS DIGITAL API will be ignored and thus, no longer processed.\n\u00a0\nTermination for Nonpayment: GENESIS DIGITAL may terminate Client\u2019s agreement WITHOUT notice for nonpayment, where Client\u2019s account is in arrears, delinquent, or past due for seven days. GENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to provide a short grace period at its discretion for long-standing customers, or customers with long-standing good credit. Client understands and agrees that the consequences of nonpayment may be severe for Client\u2019s business and assumes all liability and risk of loss if Client\u2019s access to any GENESIS DIGITAL Product is terminated for nonpayment. Client agrees that any Termination for Nonpayment is GENESIS DIGITAL\u2019S right and is solely caused by Client\u2019s actions. Client further agrees that this serves as Client\u2019s notice of such Termination for Nonpayment, and that Client assumes all liability for any Termination for Nonpayment and expressly agrees to hold GENESIS DIGITAL harmless for all damages Client may suffer as a result of such Termination for Nonpayment.\n\n\n13. Authorized Users\n\n\n\nBy accessing or using GENESIS DIGITAL Products or services, Client represents that Client is authorized to access and/or use the Products, and only individuals within Client\u2019s organization are authorized and permitted to do so (each an \u201cAuthorized User\u201d).

Non-Solicitation\n\n\n\nDuring the term of Client\u2019s GENESIS DIGITAL Agreement, and for 12 months thereafter, Client agrees that it will not directly or indirectly recruit, solicit, or otherwise induce or attempt to induce any employee of GENESIS DIGITAL (or its Affiliates) that had direct contact with Client while that employee was acting in the course and scope of the employee\u2019s duties with GENESIS DIGITAL to terminate his or her employment with GENESIS DIGITAL. Client acknowledges that if it breaches this paragraph and the employee left his or her employment with GENESIS DIGITAL, it would be difficult to determine actual damages. Based on what the Parties presently know, they agree that an amount equal to 100% of the relevant employee\u2019s GENESIS DIGITAL annual salary is a reasonable estimate of the damages that would accrue if a breach of this provision occurred in the future and the relevant employee terminated his or her employment with GENESIS DIGITAL as a result. Client agrees that the amount of liquidated damages is fair and reasonable and would not act as a penalty in such an instance.\n\n\n15.\u00a0Acceptable Use Policy\n\n\nKartra is committed to ensuring the highest level of service for its members.
