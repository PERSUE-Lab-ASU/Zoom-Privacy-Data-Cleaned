<h1><span><span style="font-size:1.00rem;">4. Billing Policy and Payment</span></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use of GENESIS DIGITAL products and services (including but not limited to WebinarJam, EverWebinar, and Kartra) constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to comply with this section.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
All accounts are set up on a prepaid basis. Payment must be received by GENESIS DIGITAL before any billable product or service is provided/activated. In the event of a trial period, payment information must be on file before Client’s account is created. Client is required to keep a valid credit/debit card on file to charge for recurring monthly subscription fees. All recurring subscriptions are automatically invoiced and charged to the credit/debit card on file.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Trial subscriptions are limited to one trial per person, per product. The purchase and subsequent cancellation of multiple trials may result in permanent closure of the account. If it is determined that any Client fails to pay the agreed upon monthly or annual payments by exploitation of any self-billing feature, all associated accounts may be terminated immediately, without warning, and Client will be billed for all unpaid usage.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Subscription billing is based on the availability of products and services within the parameters defined by Client’s package(s). Certain fees may be usage-based (e.g.WebinarJam/EverWebinar for Mass Market events).</p>

<p><br>
Payment receipts are provided electronically with each purchase and may also be provided upon Client’s request.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
<strong><span><span>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Billing Cycle:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Credit/Debit Card Billing: All credit/debit cards are automatically charged on the Client’s specific billing cycle date.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Payment failure: In the event a credit/debit card fails to charge successfully, access to the product will immediately cease.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Deactivation: GENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to remove Client application data from its servers after nonpayment.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Cancellation: Cancellation of a subscription immediately stops automatic subscription billing. If there is time remaining in a subscription period, access to the service will remain open until the end of the prepaid billing cycle.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fees:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Collections Fee: In the event an account is submitted to a third-party collections service, a $35.00 processing fee may be assessed to the existing account balance. This fee is in addition to any other fees previously assessed on the account.</p>

<p>Chargebacks: If a customer initiates a chargeback, GENESIS DIGITAL may assess a $50.00 processing fee for each individual chargeback.<br>
<br>
Interest: Any charges not paid when due are subject to interest at a rate equal to the lesser of: (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowed by applicable law.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
GENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to increase subscription pricing at the time of renewal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
<strong><span><span>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Payment Methods:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GENESIS DIGITAL accepts payments from most major credit cards, and in some cases, PayPal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;4.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Subscription Billing:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Invoices are generated and payments are collected at the beginning of each billing period. Client billing periods typically begin on the day of the month (or year for yearly plans) in which the Client purchases the GENESIS DIGITAL subscription. Clients must request to cancel their subscriptions at least 10 days prior to their next billing date to avoid being charged on the billing date. GENESIS DIGITAL will not prorate any portion of unused subscription services. All subscription fees are nonrefundable except as described below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Account limits:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every Kartra package or plan comes with limits on certain areas of asset creation and &nbsp;resources consumption as follows:</p>

	&nbsp;</li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<u><span><span>Automatic Package Upgrade:</span></span></u> &nbsp; Accounts are automatically upgraded to the appropriate package when the CONTACT count goes beyond the package limit, which will result in a higher subscription fee.</p>

<p><br>
<u><span>Languages, contacts, custom domains, Team Members:</span></u> These features are subject to plan limits. An upgrade to the next plan level is required once account limits are met. The features currently offered on an unlimited basis are: emails, bandwidth, pages, videos, products, membership sites, help desks, Funnel Mappers.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>4.7&nbsp; &nbsp; Excessive Use of “Unlimited” Plans:&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Client’s excessive use of “unlimited” plans may cause a degradation in the service(s) GENESIS DIGITAL provides. Unauthorized or excessive use beyond that normally experienced by business customers may lead to account throttling, suspension, or termination. Unlimited shall never be shared with any other independent or separate account, individual or user. For this reason, GENESIS DIGITAL may consider a Client’s use to be “excessive,” in GENESIS DIGITAL’s sole discretion, when considering the following categories of use:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(a) Unreasonable number of requests to our servers, (b) Volume of page views, (c) Volume of video views, (d) Video streaming bandwidth consumed, (e) Number of Videos uploaded per day, week, month, etc., (f) Number of emails sent per day, week, month, etc. &nbsp;This list is non-exhaustive and GENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to determine Client’s excessive use of unlimited plans at any time, for any reason.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, unlimited plans cannot, under any circumstances, be used for providing a video service, email service, or other high volume or multi-person video or email purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GENESIS DIGITAL further reserves the right to withdraw or change any unlimited feature at any time. If GENESIS DIGITAL makes any change(s) to an unlimited feature, Client will receive a notification describing the change(s) to the relevant unlimited feature and the date such changes take effect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>4.8&nbsp; &nbsp; Package Upgrade/Downgrade:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GENESIS DIGITAL subscriptions are purchased on a fixed-term basis: monthly, yearly, or bi-yearly, depending on the plan Client registers for. When an account is upgraded to a higher tier, the system will run a one-off pro-rated charge for the remaining days of the current billing period. Thereafter, the standard fees for Client’s newly upgraded package will become effective. Overages are charged based on the package subscription active at the time the overages are incurred.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Account downgrades require communication with GENESIS DIGITAL’S support portal to ensure Client’s account assets are reduced below package requirements. Account downgrades will go into effect the following billing cycle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>4.9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Limitations During Trial Periods:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it relates to WebinarJam, during the trial period, trial users will experience certain limitations. Access to the API and automation features will not be available to trial users. Additionally, there is a maximum of 500 email invitations that can be sent from the registration pages during the trial period.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>4.10&nbsp; &nbsp; Refund Policies:</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<p>Refunds only available to new customers on the following terms and must be requested within 30 days of the commencement of a subscription.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Kartra usage overage fees are non-refundable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trial payments are non-refundable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
Refunds will not be given for unused or partially used subscriptions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>4.11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cancellation Process:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Creating a cancellation request: A request to cancel a GENESIS DIGITAL Product must be initiated at least 10 days prior to the next invoice date. For Kartra users, cancellation can also be done via the Billing Profile self-service portal in Client’s Account. Any other request to cancel a GENESIS DIGITAL Product must be made via the customer support portal with a GENESIS DIGITAL representative at least 10 days prior to the next invoice date. Clients are encouraged to keep records of all communications regarding cancellation. Until a cancellation request is made, or a cancellation processed via the self-service portal, GENESIS DIGITAL will continue to treat Client’s Account as an open account. Unless canceled, the billing cycle will continue, possibly resulting in a past due account that may be turned over to a third-party collection service. It is imperative to contact a GENESIS DIGITAL representative, utilize the self-service option, or submit an online ticket if Client wishes to initiate cancellation of its GENESIS DIGITAL account.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cancellation of an account does not dismiss outstanding invoices or nullify previously agreed charges. At the time of cancellation, any outstanding balance must be settled. All canceled accounts with an outstanding balance may be turned over to a third-party collection service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Client Data may be deleted at the discretion of GENESIS DIGITAL when Client’s account is closed for any reason.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong><span><span>4.12 Billing Disputes:</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<p>Client agrees to provide GENESIS DIGITAL 30 days to attempt settlement of any billing dispute before disputing with any third-party credit/debit card company or bank. Should GENESIS DIGITAL receive a chargeback from a third-party credit/debit card company or bank on the Client’s behalf before GENESIS DIGITAL has been given a chance to resolve the issue, GENESIS DIGITAL may charge Client for its time spent resolving such disputes and any associated fees incurred by GENESIS DIGITAL, in addition to the $50.00 chargeback fee mentioned above. Regardless of the outcome of the chargeback, GENESIS DIGITAL retains the right to collect on any services or fees that are due. GENESIS DIGITAL may submit any disputed amounts to a collection agency. Once a chargeback has been received, GENESIS DIGITAL has the right to suspend the account until the matter is resolved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>4.13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applicable Taxes:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”). Client agrees to pay applicable direct or indirect Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder, which, to the extent GENESIS DIGITAL is legally required to collect the same, will be itemized on the product invoice. If Client has an obligation to withhold any amounts under any law or tax regime (other than U.S. income tax law), Client will gross up the payments so that GENESIS DIGITAL receives the amount actually quoted and invoiced. If GENESIS DIGITAL has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Client is responsible under this section, the appropriate amount will be invoiced and paid by the Client unless, prior to the invoice date, the Client provides GENESIS DIGITAL with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unless otherwise indicated in writing, all fees and other charges are in U.S. dollars, and all payments shall be in U.S. currency. In no event will GENESIS DIGITAL credit, refund, or reimburse you for a foreign exchange fee charged by your credit card for any difference in fees due to currency conversion. Client understands and agrees that GENESIS DIGITAL uses dynamic marketplace pricing. Client’s pricing is subject to change at the sole discretion of GENESIS DIGITAL at any time.</p>

<p><br>
<strong><span><span>4.14 Subscription Ownership, Control, and Transfer:</span></span></strong></p>

<p><br>
GENESIS DIGITAL shall not be responsible for any ownership conflict between two (or more) partners, associates, staff members, customer, or managers claiming ownership or control over a GENESIS DIGITAL Product account. GENESIS DIGITAL will always regard the person or entity currently paying for the account as the sole and rightful owner (and manager) of the account.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
GENESIS DIGITAL will only consider an account ownership transfer upon express written consent from both parties involved in the transaction: the current account owner and the designated account recipient. Once the transfer is approved by GENESIS DIGITAL, the transfer is non-revocable, and the recipient will become the sole and rightful owner thereafter. Moreover, from the date of transfer onwards, the account recipient will become responsible for all future payments on the account and warrants they have &nbsp;read and agreed to this Agreement and all incorporated policies. &nbsp;In the event of a transfer of an account, the recipient shall be required to purchase a new subscription at current rates.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9.1 Third Party Sites: </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GENESIS DIGITAL may provide various links to external sites that provide useful resources, products, or services. In some cases, when accessing GENESIS DIGITAL Sites, hyperlinks (or “links”) will direct Clients to or connect Clients with other websites that are not related to the Sites. Where such websites are third-party owned and operated, they are not prepared by, offered by, or controlled by GENESIS DIGITAL. In such cases, GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible in any way for the quality, content, nature, applicability, or reliability of third-party sites accessible by hyperlink from GENESIS DIGITAL Sites. If Client chooses to leave a GENESIS DIGITAL Site, Client should be aware that neither this Agreement nor any GENESIS DIGITAL policies apply to third-party sites. Client should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data-gathering practices, of third-party sites, regardless of whether Client followed a link from a GENESIS DIGITAL Site to get there.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Unless stated otherwise, GENESIS DIGITIAL’s decision to provide links to external or third-party sites does not imply affiliation, endorsement, or adoption of those sites, any information contained therein, or any products or services offered on the third-party sites. GENESIS DIGITAL does not and cannot guarantee that the information or other material linked is accurate, current, or available. Client understands that GENESIS DIGITAL assumes no responsibility or liability for any external links or any content on such third-party sites, and Client agrees that GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible whatsoever for any actions Client takes on third-party sites, including any purchases. GENESIS DIGITAL likewise makes no claims regarding and accepts no responsibility for third-party sites that link to any GENESIS DIGITAL Sites.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Even where GENESIS DIGITAL expressly endorses a product or service (which endorsement may be based on the personal or professional opinion of one or more persons), Client understands that GENESIS DIGITAL’s position or opinion on the product or service is based on those factors we have considered, and that we do not have the ability to evaluate or opine on the quality, price, advisability, suitability, need, or satisfaction that Client may experience with such products or services. Client should always do your own due diligence on any product or service prior to purchasing, to determine if it is right for you, whether or not GENESIS DIGITAL recommends it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9.2 Affiliate Offerings: </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some cases GENESIS DIGITAL or its owners may have an affiliate relationship with a third-party site or service provider mentioned on the Sites, and may be compensated (e.g., receive a valuable benefit, or even a commission) if Client visits and/or purchases a product or service from the affiliated site. GENESIS DIGITAL will generally endeavor to identify any such relationships so that you understand that even though we endorse a particular product or service, GENESIS DIGITAL also may be compensated in some way if Client chooses to do business with the recommended business or site. However, Client should assume that GENESIS DIGITAL does have such a relationship – and that GENESIS DIGITAL will be compensated if Client purchases a product or service. Where GENESIS DIGITAL has an affiliate relationship with such third- party sites, our receipt of compensation does not increase Client’s cost to purchase the product or service, and if you purchase through an affiliate link, you will generally receive valuable bonuses that you would not otherwise be entitled to receive. if the possibility of GENESIS DIGITAL receiving compensation is not agreeable to Client, please do not buy through any link on the Sites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Likewise, GENESIS DIGITAL’s Software, Products and services, including those that are available through the Sites may also be offered by or through third-party affiliates who are compensated by us, for example if you purchase a product or service from us. While GENESIS DIGITAL is responsible for claims we have made regarding GENESIS DIGITAL’s Software, Products or services, GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible for any claims made by third parties. Moreover, those third parties may promise the inclusion of various bonuses or additional products or services. If those bonuses, products, or services are a part of GENESIS DIGITAL’s offer, GENESIS DIGITAL is responsible for delivering or providing them and will do so. If the third-party affiliate has offered additional bonuses, products, or services that are not a part of GENESIS DIGITAL’s offer, Client should contact the third-party directly, regarding those bonuses, products, or services.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>9.3 User-Driven Marketplaces: </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GENESIS DIGITAL's Software, Products and services, including those that are available through the Sites enable Clients to set up various marketplaces to list, advertise, promote and sell their products and services to other users.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The products and services in Client marketplaces are not created by, offered by, endorsed by&nbsp;<br>
or controlled by GENESIS DIGITAL. GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible in any way for the quality, content, nature, applicability, or reliability of Client marketplaces. If Client chooses to purchase, register, download or to engage with any products, services, or provider, Client does so at your own risk. &nbsp;GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible for the accuracy or validity of any information or product. Client understands that GENESIS DIGITAL is assuming no responsibility or liability for any content, and Client agrees that GENESIS DIGITAL is not responsible whatsoever for any damage Client may suffer.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Client should always do your own due diligence on any product or service prior to purchasing, to determine if it is right for you, and whether the product/service provider is a reputed user.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<u>Use of Name and Logo:</u> Use of any branded images, titles, names or logos associated with GENESIS DIGITAL or any of its Products for any purpose is strictly forbidden in the Client marketplace.

&nbsp;<br>
IMPORTANT: Termination for any reason, including billing End Users who have terminated with Client or where no service is being provided, and Termination for Nonpayment described below, will end ALL use of the applicable GENESIS DIGITAL Product(s).

Client understands that any and all credit card or other financial transactions that are processed through the KARTRA Software or a connected gateway will no longer be processed. Moreover, any transactions that are handled by a third-party through use of a GENESIS DIGITAL API will be ignored and thus, no longer processed.<br>

Termination for Nonpayment: GENESIS DIGITAL may terminate Client’s agreement WITHOUT notice for nonpayment, where Client’s account is in arrears, delinquent, or past due for seven days. GENESIS DIGITAL reserves the right to provide a short grace period at its discretion for long-standing customers, or customers with long-standing good credit.
