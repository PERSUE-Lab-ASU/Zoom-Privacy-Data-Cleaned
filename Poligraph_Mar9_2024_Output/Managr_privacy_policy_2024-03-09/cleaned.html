Third party companies that manage and deliver advertisements to websites and applications are commonly referred to as “network advertisers.” A permitted network advertiser may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with the Services or to tailor certain advertisements and content delivered within the Managr Services or on other websites within such network advertiser’s ad network. These companies may also use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web activity including your activities on or off of the Managr Services. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques. You may learn more about network advertising industry practices and opt out of targeted behavioral advertising from many major third party network advertisers and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies via the information and tools available. The tools provided at the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page and the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page are provided by third parties, not Managr.
