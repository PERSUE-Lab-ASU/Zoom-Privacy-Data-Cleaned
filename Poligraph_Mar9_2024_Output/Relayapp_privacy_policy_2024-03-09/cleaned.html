If we are processing your Personal Data as a service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.</p><p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a resident of a state with these requirements, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at notices@relay.app.</p><h3>Access</h3><p>You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:</p><ul><li><p>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</p></li><li><p>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.</p></li><li><p>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.</p></li><li><p>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.</p></li><li><p>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</p></li></ul><p>If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient.

Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.</p><h3>Correction</h3><p>You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate Personal Data that we have collected about you.</p><h3>Exercising Your Rights</h3><p>To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p><p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p><p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p><ul><li>Email us at: notices@relay.app</li></ul><p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p><h3>Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In </h3><p>We will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months.

We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise those rights. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.</p><h2>Other State Law Privacy Rights</h2><h3>California Resident Rights</h3><p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at notices@relay.app. However, we do not disclose Personal Data to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes.</p><h3>Nevada Resident Rights</h3><p>If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Data to third parties who intend to license or sell that Personal Data.

However, we do not sell Personal Data.</p><h2>European Union Data Subject Rights</h2><h3>EU Residents</h3><p>If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.</p><p>For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. Relay will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.</p><p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at notices@relay.app. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data.
