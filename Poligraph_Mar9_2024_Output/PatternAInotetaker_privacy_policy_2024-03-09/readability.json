From time to time, PatternAI acquires companies who may operate under their own privacy policies. You will continue to be presented with those companies\u2019 privacy policies on their websites until the integration with PatternAI is complete and those websites are linked to this Privacy Policy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The use of our products and services, including those available through other PatternAI websites that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, \u201cOfferings\u201d), are subject to the terms of the applicable customer agreement. The use of our website is subject to the PatternAI Website Terms and Conditions of Use. The terms of this Privacy Policy are incorporated into and form part of those agreements.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Data Collection. There are two primary ways in which PatternAI collects Information from you: through Interactions and through Offerings as set forth below.</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">Interactions</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">When you interact online or offline with PatternAI, we may receive your Information, including your Personal Data. For example, we receive your Information when, for example, you:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Visit PatternAI\u2019s websites or offices; download materials through our websites; provide or update account information through our websites; register or attend PatternAI-hosted or sponsored events (such as promotional events, webcasts, contests, or hackathons); participate in community programs; communicate with us including by emails, phone, texts, and online chats; provide testimonials; provide data through conversations which may be recorded and transcribed; or provide data through 'chat' interactions with artificial intelligence (AI) models.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We collect Information about you from other sources such as public databases, joint business partners, social media platforms, conference/event hosts, and partners when you interact with them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We refer collectively to these contacts as \u201cInteractions\u201d and we explain below how we use the Information we collect through them.</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">What We Collect via Your Interactions</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">We (or others acting on our behalf, including technology partners whose products we may use, such as email platforms, data warehouse providers, etc.) may collect your Information, including your Personal Data, through the Interactions described more fully below. The Personal Data we collect includes such things as:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Name, email address, physical address including country, title, payment details, phone number, user name / user, ID, IP address, MAC address (or other device identifiers automatically assigned to your device when you access the internet), photographs or videos (subject to your consent when visiting our offices, attending an event, or providing a testimonial, recording data sent to our servers, etc.).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We collect Personal Data in various ways, such as when you manually provide your Personal Data to our website forms or provide it to us or others. IP addresses are also collected on an automated basis through your use of the website services using cookies and other technologies associated with web browsers. We may infer your location from your IP address. For more on the use of cookies and like technologies, see the PatternAI Cookie Policy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When you make purchases through our website, we use third-party payment processors to collect credit card or other financial information. PatternAI does not store the credit card information you provide, only confirmation that payment was made.</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">How We Use Information Collected from Interactions</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">PatternAI does not sell your data to third parties in any way.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">PatternAI uses Information it collects from your Interactions to deliver services to you in accordance with our terms, to fulfill our legal obligations, or to conduct necessary business activities (sometimes called \u201clegitimate interests\u201d), as described below.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We take seriously the need to balance our legitimate interests with your privacy rights and summarize for you here how we use your Information, including Personal Data.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We use your Information to:</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Fulfill your orders or respond to your requests for information</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">For example, to satisfy your requests for website materials such as marketing collateral or white papers, we collect and use your name and email address.</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Operate, enhance, and personalize your experience on our website</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">We collect Information via cookies and like technologies as set forth in the PatternAI Cookie Policy to fulfill our legitimate interest in operating our website, making it easy to navigate, enriching the available content and offering information tailored to your interests. In so doing, we may receive your location information, which you can stop at any time by configuring the location setting permissions in your device.</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Issue you PatternAI accounts for access to online communities and forums (including blogs)</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">When you join our online communities and forums, including blogs (collectively, \u201conline forums\u201d), we collect your Personal Data so you can participate. The guidelines associated with those online forums recommend not sharing private or proprietary information on them, as many aspects of them are public. If you choose to submit content to online forums, such content will be considered \u201cpublic\u201d and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Send you administrative information</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">We may need to notify you (or we may choose to inform you) when we make updates to our terms or policies or make changes to our website services. We will use your name and email address to send administrative notices to you, which due to their nature are treated differently from marketing communications from which you can opt out.</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Manage your PatternAI account or sub-accounts</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">In order to perform the services under the contract or interactions between you and PatternAI, including provision of services such as recording, transcribing and processing data, we need to collect certain Information from you. Without this Information, we may not be able to deliver the services or comply with our legal obligations. All data outputs processed by PatternAI is the exclusive property of PatternAI</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Send you marketing communications</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">Where we have your consent to do so (if required), we will provide you with product announcements, educational materials, announcements about special offers, or information about upcoming or ongoing online/offline events, such as PatternAILive! or .conf and related offers. In accordance with applicable law, we give you the choice to opt out of receiving these communications.</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Invite you to participate on customer advisory boards or in surveys, studies, and assessments of Offerings</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">We use your Personal Data to register you to participate on customer advisory boards (CABs) or when we request feedback from you about PatternAI Offerings so that we can fulfill our legitimate interest in improving them and growing our business. Your participation on CABs and in user surveys is voluntary and subject to your consent, the terms of your agreements with us, and this Privacy Policy.</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Diagnose and fix technical issues, monitor for security, and otherwise protect our property</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">We do this to satisfy our legitimate interest in assessing actual or potential threats to our facilities, attendees at PatternAI-sponsored events, our IT systems and networks, and website services. We may process your Personal Data, in particular your IP address, for this purpose.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect our legal rights or those of others</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For any other purpose disclosed to you in connection with our website services from time to time</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If we process your Personal Data for a purpose other than that set out above, we will provide you with information about such processing, and if required, obtain your consent.</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">How to Access and Control Your Information</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Deactivate your account</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account. If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact our support team. Please be aware that deactivating your account does not instantly delete your information; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services. For more information on how to delete your information, see below. Data in deactivated, canceled or disregarded accounts may be automatically deleted on a periodic basis without consent for privacy purposes.</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Delete your information</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove meeting recordings or your data within your account.</p><h6 dir=\"ltr\">Requests related to use of information</h6><p dir=\"ltr\">By using our services and providing data to PatternAI, users agree to terms in this privacy policy. This policy may be updated from time to time without notice. Only paying users may have a limited license to download and retain data processed to generate outputs, including but not limited to recordings, transcriptions, generative AI outputs, and other AI outputs. Free users, trial users, and other non-paying users are not granted a license to download processed data and AI outputs generated by PatternAI, including recordings, transcriptions and AI outputs, which remain the sole and exclusive intellectual property and work generated by PatternAI unless otherwise specified in writing by both parties. In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don\u2019t have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we deactivate and delete your account and data as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).&nbsp;</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">Opting Out of Marketing Emails</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">If you no longer want to receive marketing emails from PatternAI on a go-forward basis, please submit your request through our data request portal. Alternatively, you may use the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d feature in our email messages.</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">Offerings</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">We also collect Information, including Personal Data, when providing our Offerings. We may ask you for this Information directly, or in some cases, we may collect it when certain features are enabled.

We work hard to help ensure a balance between our legitimate interests and your privacy rights.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">License Usage Data is Information that allows us to identify your account entitlements, such as license consumption, capacity, or type in our systems through an assigned license ID. We use this information to validate accounts and automate license verification.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Usage Data is Information about your operating environment, user/product interactions, and sessions. This includes information such as your network and systems architecture, OS and product versions, page loads and views, searches by number and type, errors, number of active and licensed users, source types and format (e.g., json, xml, and csv), web browser, http referrer page, and app workflows.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Usage Data is private and exclusive to each user. PatternAI does not sell Usage Data to third parties. PatternAI does not incorporate Usage Data in any AI models or datasets that may be accessible to third parties. PatternAI does not incorporate any Usage Data to train any language models or machine learning models for use by any third parties. In cases where a customer requests PatternAI to build, train, or fine tune a custom private AI model for customer's own private and exclusive use, PatternAI may incorporate Usage Data to create and train a private model exclusively for such customer. Private trained models are created solely on customer's own proprietary data and publicly available data. Private trained models are available only to the specific customer who requested such model. In no circumstance is Usage Data shared with any third parties, nor do third parties have any access to private Usage Data or private models.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We use Usage Data to fulfill our legal obligations in providing the Offerings to you and to fulfill our legitimate interest in supporting and enhancing them. For example, we may use this data to:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Troubleshoot issues, provide support, and update our Offerings; provide guidance to help you optimize your usage of our Offerings; better understand how our users configure our Offerings; determine which configurations or practices optimize performance (e.g., best practices); benchmark key performance indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d); recommend enhancements; perform data analysis and audits; identify, understand, and anticipate performance issues and the factors that affect them; identify product security issues that may affect you; improve and develop new features and functionality; monitor the health, performance, and security of our Offerings</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Where possible we hash identifiable information connected to user activity before use.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Support Usage Data is Information we combine from License Usage and Usage Data as part of a customized support program that offers you accelerated troubleshooting, notices of patches/upgrades, tips to optimize performance, and suggestions about other Offerings that may be of interest to you. The combined data is customer-identifiable so that we can help personalize your experience. From time to time, we may also use the Information to analyze usage trends, such as by industry or sector, after it has been de-identified. Participation in this program is voluntary and you can opt out at any time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Mobile Device Data is Information we collect in certain PatternAI Offerings (\u201cApps\u201d as discussed below) that associates your mobile device with an identifier for your App to help us improve the user experience and personalize your services and content. We may also receive information that your mobile device sends when you use our Apps, such as a device identifier or OS. Depending on your configuration of PatternAI\u2019s Offerings, location information about you (or your end users) may be shared with PatternAI; however, you can disable location sharing using the location-setting features on your mobile device.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Certain PatternAI Offerings rely on automated methods of processing, such as artificial intelligence (AI), which are a set of technologies and processes that allow computers to learn, reason, and assist in decision making. These technologies may consume Usage Data or other data you input into the AI Offering that may be associated with you. The use of data in connection with our AI Offerings is set forth in the relevant terms.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For more information about the data collected through our Offerings, see Offering-specific Documentation (e.g., Share Performance Data for PatternAI Enterprise).</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">Other Collection Practices</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">We also collect Personal Data from you to fulfill our contractual commitments to you.

We refer to these collectively as \u201cApps.\u201d These Apps are versatile and have access to a broad set of web technologies that can be used to collect and use your Information.

It does not apply to Apps developed by others (\u201cApp Developers\u201d) and available through PatternAI, third-party marketplaces (e.g., AWS Marketplace, Apple, Google Play Store, etc.), or interoperable with PatternAI Offerings.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">PatternAI requires App Developers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws but cannot guarantee that they do so. Before you use Apps created by App Developers, you should familiarize yourself with their privacy policies and license agreements.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">PatternAI collects data generated from the use and performance of Apps that interoperate with PatternAI Offerings, such as crash information, version, session duration, and user engagement (e.g., number of downloads, active/licensed users, and log-ins).

PatternAI takes reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard Personal Data against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, misuse, or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission, software, or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Data in deactivated accounts, whether by you or by PatternAI, may be periodically deleted without notice for privacy purposes. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of an account has been compromised), please notify us immediately in accordance with the Contact PatternAI section below. If PatternAI learns of a breach of its systems, PatternAI may notify you or others consistent with applicable law and/or as agreed in our contract with you.
