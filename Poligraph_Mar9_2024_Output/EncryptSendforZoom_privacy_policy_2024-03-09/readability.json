This Privacy Policy outlines how Encrypt Send collects and utilizes information from customers and other individuals who access or use our website, mobile applications, product platform and any other sites, products, or services linked to this Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as the \u201cServices\u201d). By utilizing our Services, you acknowledge that we will collect and use your information as described in this Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as \u201cyou\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0\nThroughout this policy, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to Encrypt Send, and \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cuser\u201d refer to the reader. We recommend reading this Privacy Policy thoroughly to stay fully informed.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you or your organization have an individual agreement with us, that agreement may include privacy terms that also apply to the information you provide under it. Please review those terms, as they may differ from or be more restrictive than the terms in this Privacy Policy.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis Privacy Policy does not extend to any third-party websites and apps you may use, including those linked to within our Services. Before clicking on any links, it is essential to review the terms and policies for third-party websites and apps.\u00a0\u00a0\nEncrypt Send\u2019s core products and services assist users in creating, completing, and validating digital or electronic transactions securely. We act as a secure transportation vehicle for sensitive data. As part of our Services, users request us to collect and record information that helps validate transportation transactions. This information includes the individuals involved in the transactions and the devices used by those individuals.\u00a0\u00a0\nEncrypt Send processes two main categories of personal information when you use our products and services:\u00a0\u00a0\nYour personal information as a user or customer (or potential customer) of Encrypt Send \u2013 referred to as Customer Account Data.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe personal information of your end users who use or interact with you from Encrypt Send\u2019s platform \u2013 this category includes both Customer Usage Data (e.g., communications metadata) and Customer Content (e.g., contents of communications). \u00a0\nWe process these categories of personal information differently due to the distinct relationship we have with you, our customer, versus the indirect relationship we have with your end users.\u00a0\u00a0\nHOW WE COLLECT AND PROCESS INFORMATION?\u00a0\u00a0\nTo provide and enhance our Services and support advertising and marketing efforts, we collect information about visitors to our sites, users of our Services (Customer Account Data), the devices they use, and, in some cases, their locations.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you visit our website or request more information about Encrypt Send, we automatically collect information using tracking technologies such as cookies and through web forms where you input your details. We use this information to fulfill your requests made through the web form.\u00a0\u00a0\nCertain information is collected directly from you when you fill out forms with your name or email address. Other information, like details about devices, browsers, or locations, is collected automatically without requiring your input into a form.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou have the option to choose whether to visit our sites, install our apps, or provide information to us. However, not providing certain information may limit your ability to use some parts of our Services.\u00a0\u00a0\nInformation You Share Directly: \u00a0\nOn Encrypt Send\u2019s public-facing website, you may fill out web forms to request contact from us, subscribe to a newsletter, participate in a survey, or attend an online demo. The personal information required in these forms will vary based on the form\u2019s purpose. We will request the necessary information to fulfill your request through the form. For example, if you want to sign up for an email newsletter, we will ask for your email address, and if you request a call from us, we will ask for your phone number. Additionally, we may request additional information to understand you better as a customer, such as your Encrypt Send use case, company name, or role at your company. If you wish to opt-out of further marketing communications from Encrypt Send, you can do so through a preferences page linked in any marketing email you receive, or you can contact our Support Team (see Sections 5 & 12 below).\u00a0\u00a0\nInformation We Collect Automatically: \u00a0\nWhen you visit Encrypt Send\u2019s website, including our web forms, we and our service providers automatically collect certain information using tracking technologies like cookies, web beacons, and similar tools. This information helps us understand how visitors use our websites, which pages and features are popular, and how we can improve our websites and track the performance of our advertisements. Visitors to our website can change cookie settings at any time using their web browsers built in settings.\u00a0\nWhat Customer Account Data We Process When You Communicate with Us\u00a0\nWhen you communicate with us, you may share personal information, such as contact details. We retain a record of these interactions.\u00a0\u00a0\nInformation shared during such communication, including contact details and other relevant information, is recorded by us. This allows us to track the inquiries received from you and other customers, improve our products and services, and provide training for team members. Additionally, this information helps manage ongoing customer relationships. While we take appropriate measures to protect any sensitive information shared with us, we advise against sharing any personal or sensitive data in these communications that are not necessary for the teams to assist you.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat Customer Account Data We Process When You Sign Up for and Log Into a Encrypt Send Account\u00a0\nWhen you sign up for a Encrypt Send account, we may request certain information, such as contact details and billing information, to facilitate communication and enable payment for our products and services. Additionally, we automatically collect certain information, such as your IP address, when you log into your account or when you interact with our APIs. This data helps us understand our users and detect, prevent, and investigate fraud, abuse, or security incidents. \u00a0\nInformation You Share Directly: \u00a0\nDuring the sign-up process, we ask for your name, email address, and optionally, your company name, along with other details. This information is used to identify you, communicate about your account(s), and recognize you during interactions with our account portal or otherwise. We may also use your email address to send you information about other Encrypt Send products, services, or events of potential interest. To opt-out of further marketing communications, you can adjust preferences through your marketing preferences page or contact us.\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring the sign-up process, we may also request your mobile number to send a verification code, ensuring you are a human user. Additionally, a Encrypt Send team member may contact you at this number to assist with onboarding unless you indicate otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen setting up two-factor authentication, you may provide a mobile number or email address to receive verification codes during the login process.\u00a0\u00a0\nUpgrading your free account may require you to provide payment method information, such as credit card details and billing address, to our payment processor for billing purposes. In some cases, we may need to collect a physical address and proof of identity for compliance reasons, such as obtaining a phone number in certain countries. This information may be shared with telecommunications carriers or local government authorities as required by law. \u00a0\nCertain Encrypt Send products may necessitate completing an application form detailing your company information and intended product use, such as applying for premium access for an entire domain. This information is used for the specified purpose and may also contribute to improving our internal processes, services, and training.\u00a0\u00a0\nInformation We Generate or Collect Automatically: \u00a0\nUpon signing up for a Encrypt Send account, unique IDs are automatically assigned to you and your account(s).\u00a0We keep records of these credentials to identify you when your application makes requests to our API using these credentials. Additionally, when you use our account portal, we collect data like your IP address through tracking technologies for analytics and navigation improvement purposes.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlease note that when you make requests to our website, we collect the IP address of your devices or servers, along with processing the information contained in those interactions. All information collected when using Encrypt Send\u2019s account portal, products, or services may be used to detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, fraud, or misuse of our platform and services.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe automatically collect information from you and your devices during your use of our Services, even if you visit our sites or apps without logging in. For options on managing information we automatically collect, refer to Section 5 of this Privacy Policy.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe information automatically collected includes:\u00a0\u00a0\nDevice, Usage Information, and Transactional Data: \u00a0\nThis category covers information about how you use our Services and the devices you use to access them, such as IP address, geolocation (with your permission), unique device identifiers, operating system, browser type, usage data (web log data, clicks, page views, session duration, etc.), and transactional data related to electronic transactions (names, email addresses, and audit logs).\u00a0\u00a0\nCookies and Related Technologies:\u00a0\n\u00a0We may use Cookies or similar technologies like web beacons, local shared objects, and tracking pixels to store or collect information, including user preferences and usernames, to improve navigation and tailor advertisements.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnalytics: \u00a0\nServices like Google Analytics may be used to understand how people use our Services, such as pages visited, duration, and the website visited before accessing Encrypt Send\u2019s website.\u00a0\u00a0\nTailored Advertising\u00a0\u00a0\nAds for Other Products & Services: \u00a0\nThird parties whose products or services are marketed on our Services may use Cookies to tailor and serve advertising based on information like past visits to our Services and other sites, as well as report the number of ads served and responses.\u00a0\u00a0\nAds for Our Products and Services: \u00a0\nServices like Google, AdRoll, and Appnexus may be used to deliver personalized ads about our products and services on our Services and other platforms. These third parties may use their own Cookies on your devices for this purpose.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor options regarding cookies and related technologies, please refer to Section 5 of this Policy.\u00a0\nInformation We Collect from Other Sources: \u00a0\nWe may collect information about you from third-party sources, such as marketers, partners, researchers, and affiliates, where legally permitted. For instance, if you register for our Services on another website, that website may share your information with us. Additionally, other customers may provide us with your information, such as when a customer wants to send you documentation using our Services.\u00a0\u00a0\nCombining Information from Different Sources: \u00a0\nWe may combine information obtained from other sources with data collected from you or your device as described in this Privacy Policy.\u00a0\u00a0\nOther Customer Account Data We Collect\u00a0\nWe may collect publicly available information about you to better understand our customer base. This information may be sourced from services like LinkedIn or third-party providers and may include details about your industry, company size, and website URL.\u00a0\u00a0\nInformation We Collect from You: \u00a0\nYou provide us with information when you register or log in to your account, interact with our Services, and use various features, such as contacting customer support or leaving comments. The information you provide includes details like name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and billing information.\u00a0\u00a0\nAdditionally, you may provide us with information about others when using certain parts of our Services, such as adding users to an existing account or participating in electronic transactions.\u00a0\u00a0\nHOW ENCRYPT SEND PROCESSES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\u00a0\u00a0\nAt Encrypt Send, we collect and process your personal information in the following instances:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen you visit our public-facing website (encryptsend.com), sign up for a free Encrypt Send account, or request information about Encrypt Send or our products.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you communicate with Encrypt Send\u2019s sales or support staff.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you sign up for a Encrypt Send paid account and use our products and services.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis personal information is collectively referred to as Customer Account Data.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPrivacy laws in certain jurisdictions, like the European Economic Area (EEA), differentiate between \u201ccontrollers\u201d and \u201cprocessors\u201d of personal information. As a controller, Encrypt Send decides why and how personal information is processed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you use our Services, we may process and store certain information on your behalf as a data processor. For example, when you upload or download files or documents for review, we act as a data processor and process information according to your instructions. In such instances, you, as the data controller, are responsible for most aspects of the data processing. If you have questions or concerns about such processing, including how to exercise your data subject rights, we recommend reaching out to the relevant customer.\u00a0\u00a0\nBroadly, we use Customer Account Data to further our legitimate interests, which include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUnderstanding our customers and potential customers, along with their interests in Encrypt Send\u2019s products and services.\u00a0\u00a0\nManaging our relationship with you and other customers.\u00a0\u00a0\nConducting core business operations.\u00a0\u00a0\nDetecting, preventing, or investigating security incidents, fraud, and misuse of our products and services.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHOW ENCRYPT SEND PROCESSES YOUR END USERS\u2019 PERSONAL INFORMATION\u00a0\u00a0\nYour end users\u2019 personal information may appear on Encrypt Send\u2019s platform in several ways:\u00a0\u00a0\nCommunications-related personal information, such as your mobile numbers, email addresses, names, or IP addresses, may be present when you use this information to contact other users through our products and services.\u00a0\u00a0\nYour end users\u2019 personal information may be contained in the content of communications pushed or pulled using Encrypt Send\u2019s products and services.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe refer to the information in the first two points as Customer Usage Data, and the information in the third point as Customer Content.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs mentioned earlier, privacy laws in certain jurisdictions classify data processors and data controllers. When Encrypt Send processes Customer Content, we typically act as a processor. When processing Customer Usage Data, we act as a processor in many respects but may act as a controller for certain activities, such as billing, reconciling invoices with telecommunications carriers, and troubleshooting network issues.\u00a0\u00a0\nCustomer Usage Data and Customer Content: What Encrypt Send Processes \u00a0\nEncrypt Send uses Customer Usage Data and Customer Content to provide communication services and necessary functions as a communications service provider.
