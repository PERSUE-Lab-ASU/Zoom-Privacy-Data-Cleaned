<ul><li><u>Contractual Necessity</u>: We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services.

<p>Examples of these legitimate interests include (as described in more detail above):</p>
<ul><li>Providing, customizing and improving the Services.</li><li>Marketing the Services.</li><li>Corresponding with you.</li><li>Meeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms.</li><li>Completing corporate transactions.</li></ul>
<ul><li><u>Consent</u>: In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.</li><li><u>Other Processing Grounds</u>: From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.</li></ul>

In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.</p>
