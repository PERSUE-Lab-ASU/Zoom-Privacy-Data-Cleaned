("MeetPal", "we", "us", or "our"). MeetPal operates the https://meetpal.co website.</p><p>As a data-driven company, we care deeply about privacy and data security.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected on sites, applications, destinations, or services linked to from our website. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your Personal Information and how we will treat it. By accessing or using the Site and/or the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. If you do not want your Personal Information to be processed as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site or our Services.Note to Enterprise Customers: If you are an enterprise customer of MeetPal and wish to enter into a separate data processing agreement with MeetPal in order to comply with your obligations under applicable data protection laws, please contact us at security@meetpal.co.</p><h4>Contact Us</h4><p>If you wish to ask us any questions about this policy, or to exercise any of your rights described in this Privacy Policy, you can email us at privacy@meetpal.co.</p><h4>Collection and Use</h4><p>We use the information described in this subsection for the purposes identified below, including without limitation auditing, security, debugging, internal research and development, maintaining the quality and safety of our Services, and service performance purposes. For example, we use information to measure web traffic and usage activity on our Site for purposes of improving and enhancing the functionality of our Site, to look for possible fraudulent activity, and to better understand the sources of traffic and transactions on our Site. Cookies also allow our servers to remember your account information for future visits and to provide personalized and streamlined information across related pages on our Site. In order to understand and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, we may also use web beacons, cookies, and other technology to identify the fact that you have visited our Site or seen one of our advertisements.</p><h4>Information we collect directly from you</h4><p>We collect Personal Information you provide to us:</p><p><strong>- Registration and profile and virtual business card information. </strong>When you register for an account, we collect your username, password and email address. Once you register for an account, you may also be able to create a profile and virtual business card that other users can see. Your profile and virtual business card may include information you choose to add such as your profile photo, job title and other work-related information, your approximate location, links to your profiles on various social networks, and other preferences and information. We use this information to administer your account, provide you with the relevant services and information, communicate with you regarding your account, the Service, and for customer support purposes.</p><p><strong>- Billing information.</strong> If you make a payment to MeetPal, we require you to provide your billing details, such as a name, address, email address and, in some instances, financial information corresponding to your selected method of payment. If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account holder.</p><p><strong>- Account settings. </strong>You can set various preferences and personal details on pages like your account settings page.</p><p><strong>- Calendar Information. </strong>We offer enhanced functionality to users who opt in to providing us with access to their calendar application, as described in more detail in the MeetPal Privacy Policy – Calendar Supplement.

We may also collect your Personal Information or data if you submit it to us in other contexts. For example, if you provide us with a testimonial.</p><p><strong>- Linking Information. </strong>To the extent we are able to do so, we may link your non-personally identifiable information with your personally identifiable information and we may also link information collected online with information we collect offline or information collected online by third parties.</p><p>Information we collect about you indirectly or passively when you interact with us</p><p><strong>-Usage data. </strong>We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our Services. This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on. Additionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our Site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, and timestamps. Personal Information gathered through tracking technologies may include internet or other electronic network activity information for the purposes of cross-device tracking for targeted advertising, the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, links to/from any page, and time spent at a site.</p><p><strong>- Device data. </strong>We collect data from the device and application you use to access our Services, such as your IP address, operating system version, device type, system and performance information, and browser type. We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.</p><p><strong>- Referral data. </strong>If you arrive at our Site from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.</p><p><strong>- Cookies. </strong>Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services. This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. You may consider visiting aboutcookies.org, which provides helpful information about cookies. If you wish to limit, block or delete cookies from our website – or any other website – you can use your browser to do this. Each browser is different so check the ‘Help’ menu of your particular browser or the browser settings for your mobile device to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you do this, however, certain features of our website may not work correctly or cannot be provided to you.</p><p><strong>- Web Beacons (tracking pixels).</strong> Web beacons (also known as tracking pixels) are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or open an email and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons used on web pages or in emails allow us to see how successful an article has been, or whether an email message was successfully delivered and read in a marketing campaign. We also use web beacons to learn if you have clicked on any links contained in emails. We may use this information to help us identify which emails are more interesting to you.</p><p><strong>- Information from third parties. </strong>We may collect your Personal Information or data from third parties if you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us. For example, you have the option of registering and signing into MeetPal with a third- party authentication provider. If you do this, the authentication of your logon details is handled by that third-party authenticator.​​</p><p><strong>Single Sign-On. </strong>We may use single sign-on ("SSO") to allow a user to authenticate their account using one set of login information, including through Google. We will have access to certain information from those third parties in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by those third parties, which may include, for example, your name, username, email address, language preference, and profile picture. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also send you service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, customer support, changes, or updates to features of the Site, technical and security notices).</p><p><strong>• Social Media. </strong>When you interact with our Site through various social media, such as when you click on the social media icon on the Site, follow us on a social media Site, or post a comment to one of our pages, we may receive information from the social network such as your profile information, profile picture, gender, username, user ID associated with your social media account, age range, language, country, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages about products and services that may be of interest to you.</p><p><strong>• Information from Other Sources.</strong> We may obtain information from other sources, including through publicly available sources, third-party information providers, customers, or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. We may combine this information with other information we collect from or about you. In these cases, our Privacy Policy governs the handling of the combined personal information. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages about products and services that may be of interest to you.</p><p><strong>- Analytics Services. </strong>We use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Services. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Services. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with other Personal Information you may provide to us from time to time. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

This information can include the email addresses, names, job titles and more our Customers’ contacts (“Service Data”). We collect on our Customers’ behalf updated Personal Information on those individuals from their social media profiles or other third-party sources (including, but not limited to, current email address, job titles, and employer information) (also, “Service Data”) and provide those to our Customers for their use. Please note that, while Customers may provide us with Service Data that we store and process and we collect Service Data that we store, process, and provide to our Customers, we are not responsible for the privacy and data security practices of those Customers and you should look to their privacy and data security policies for information and those Customers to address your questions or concerns.How We Use Service DataWe process Service Data through the functionality of our Services in accordance with the instructions provided to us by Customers when they use that functionality.Sharing of Service DataWe provide access to Service Data to our Customers on whose behalf we have collected it (in addition to the Service Data which our Customers originally provided to us) and we may share Service Data as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>Protection of Information</strong><br>MeetPal considers the security of all the information and data within our control to be a top priority, and consistent with this we implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, such information or data. However, no security system is impenetrable, and unanticipated system failures or the efforts of malicious actors are an unfortunate reality on the internet. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the information and data within our control, including Personal Information, is absolutely secure.</p><p><strong>Our Policy Towards Children</strong><br>MeetPal does not direct our services towards individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under the age of 18.

Set out below are the most relevant ones. Please note that while we may rely on one legal basis for a particular activity, if that is no longer applicable or available then we may be able to rely on another basis.</p><p>With Your Consent. We collect and process some of your Personal Information because we obtain your consent. When we want to use cookies to collect Personal Information from you for performance or marketing reasons, for example, we obtain your consent by displaying a banner when you first visit our Site (or, if you have deleted your cookies, when you next visit) that discloses the reasons we use cookies to collect information and links to this Privacy Policy which in turn contains more detailed information about our collection, third-party collection, and opt-out information. You must accept the use of those cookies or you may not visit or use our Site.</p><p>To Fulfill a Contract. We collect and process some of your Personal Information because we need to do so either to enter into or fulfill a contract we have with you. For example, we process your Personal Information when we provide Services to you that you have purchased on our Site.</p><p>For a Legitimate Interest. We may process your Personal Information where we or a third party have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we have a legitimate interest in understanding how people are using our Services, both to improve them and to market them more effectively. Therefore, we may use your Personal Information to understand and analyze your use of our Services. When we rely on our legitimate interest, we will carry out a balancing test between our legitimate interests and your privacy rights. Our legitimate interests include: understanding how our audience interacts with our content, our marketing and promotions, and our Services; learning about our audience in order to improve our Services for them; developing, delivering, and maintaining relevant and engaging content and promotional information; supporting the dissemination of information on topics of interest to individuals and the community; supporting individuals’ rights to receive information; and conducting our business activities and achieving our business goals.</p><p>To Comply with Legal Obligations. We will process your Personal Information when necessary to comply with legal and regulatory obligations or defend claims. For example, we may share your Personal Information in response to a court order, subpoena, or law enforcement agency's request.Retention of InformationWe will only keep your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p><p>To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process it (and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means), and the applicable legal requirements. The retention of Service Data is determined by our Customers that collect it from you or on whose behalf we collect it through the use of our Services.</p><p>In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer Personal Information.</p><p>Upon expiration of the applicable retention period we will securely destroy your personal data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p><p><strong>Access, Correction and Deletion of Information We Collect</strong><br>For Personal Information that we hold about you, you may have the right (subject to exceptions allowed by law) to:<br>- request access to your Personal Information;<br>- request we correct any inaccurate Personal Information;<br>- request we delete any Personal Information;<br>- restrict the processing of Personal Information;<br>- object to the processing of Personal Information; and/or<br>- receive a copy of your Personal Information in a structured and commonly used machine-readable format or have such Personal Information transmitted to another company.</p><p>We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing information requested to you. Modifying Profile and Virtual Business Card Information. If you have an account for our Service, you have the ability to modify certain information in your profile/virtual business card (e.g., your contact information) through the account setting page or a similar option provided on the Service. If you have any questions about modifying or updating any information in your account, please contact us at the email address provided below. Modifying Service Data. If we store, use, or process your Service Data, please contact the Customer that collected your Service Data if you would like to access, correct, or delete your Service Data, restrict or object to processing of your Service Data, or receive a copy of your Service Data. We will work with the Customer on whose behalf we store, use, or process your Service Data to respond to your request within a reasonable time.Email Communications. From time to time, we may send you emails regarding updates to our Service, products or services, notices about our organization, or information about products/services we offer that we think may be of interest to you. If you wish to unsubscribe from such emails, simply click the “unsubscribe link” provided at the bottom of the email communication. Note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain services-related email communications (e.g., account verification, confirmations of transactions, technical or legal notices).Transfer of InformationWe are located in the United States and your Personal Information that we collect is processed and stored in the United States. We rely on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and on contractual clauses in our agreements. In particular, we collect and transfer to the United States Personal Information with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of ours in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Given the lack of a finding of “adequacy”, there may be a risk that the supervisory authority and/or data processing principles and/or data subject rights in the United States might not be sufficiently appropriate or comprehensive safeguards from the perspective of the EU. We strive, however, to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information and only to use it consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Notice. Our vendors and others with whom we share your personal information in accordance with this Policy are either certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks or we use contractual clauses in our agreements with them that are designed to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information.</p><p><strong>Additional Notice to Residents of California</strong><br>Information We CollectWe collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household (for purposes of this Additional Notice to Residents of California section, “personal information”) of various types and from various sources in the course of your engagement with us and our services.
