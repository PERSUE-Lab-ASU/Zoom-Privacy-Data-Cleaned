Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p><h4><b>We use cookies to:</b></h4><p>Understand and save user's preferences for future visits. Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings.

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p><h4><b>California Online Privacy Protection Act</b></h4><p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. <br> See more at:<!-- -->    <a href=\"https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\">https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p><p>Users can visit our site anonymously.

The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p><h4><b>Fair Information Practices</b></h4><p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify the users via email within 7 business days We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p><h4><b>CAN SPAM Act</b></h4><p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

We have all our critical applications and system alerts configured on Zenduty. We manage end-to-end Incidents on Zenduty.Mohammed Shabbir S, Technical Support Lead, BookmyshowI like Zenduty\u2019s intuitive user experience throughout, be it the web UX, the Android UX, and most of all the Slack UX. We pretty much manage all our incidents from sitting inside a Slack channel and that\u2019s awesome. Other than being a robust product, I found the people providing support are the best. As an operations team lead myself, I understand the day-to-day toil and stress support can cause. The Zenduty team has just always been there, friendly, coolheaded, and ready to take action on anything thrown at them.Heinrich Roets, Operations Support, Electrum Payments.Zenduty has been great so far in terms of delivering meaningful alerts to the right person quickly, which has also improved our uptime significantly. We did not face any challenges with the onboarding, and received great support from everyone in the team - further reducing our friction while moving to Zenduty. The turnaround for most of our requests was super quick and the team was very helpful while resolving our queries!Atmesh Mishra, Associate Vice President - Platform at ChaloAll (infrastructure downtime) alerts by default go to DevOps receiver \u2026 which trigger SMS and a phone call to the concerned on-call developer based on the configuration provided. (Zenduty) ... is pretty intuitive with great support and configuring them with escalation policies is a piece of cake.Abhay Kumar, Lead DevOps Engineer at Zolo StaysZenduty serves as a command and control center for our DevOps/incident management functions. Over time, we have deployed a whole bunch of monitoring services through AWS, Datadog, GitHub, Monit, Python scripts, etc, and it has become quite a challenge to centralize the alerts and act upon them. Zenduty gives a clean way of pulling together these alerts, classifying them, assigning them, acting on them and then sending out updates.Anirban Mazumdar, CTO, UrbanpiperEasy to configure, intuitive platform that triggers alerts from our monitoring tools such as Datadog, AWS Cloudwatch, GCP, etc, and helps us respond to incidents faster.Felipe Urbina, CTO, SimplirouteIndiaMart currently has over 152,000 paying subscribers who make up 95% of the revenue.
