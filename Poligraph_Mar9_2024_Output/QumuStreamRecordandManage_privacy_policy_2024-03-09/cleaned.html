<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>



<p>Dated 10 May 2022.</p>



<p>Qumu Corporation and its group of companies (“<strong>Qumu</strong>”) operates several websites including www.qumu.com. It is Qumu’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect or receive while operating our Services. This Privacy Policy sets out how Qumu collect and use information from customers, prospective customers and other individuals who access or use our websites, who request information about our products or services, who apply for roles or vacancies at Qumu, our mobile applications, and/or any of our other sites, products, or services that link to this Privacy Policy including but not limited to the Qumu Cloud Platform (the “<strong>Services</strong>”). By using our Services, you understand that we will collect and use your information as described in this Privacy Policy (collectively “<strong>you</strong>”).</p>



<p>If you or your organization has a separate agreement with us, that agreement may have privacy terms that also apply to the information you provide to us under that agreement. Please review the terms in that agreement as they may be different or more restrictive than the terms in this Privacy Policy.</p>



<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites and apps that you may use, including any linked to in our Services. You should review the terms and policies for third-party websites and apps before clicking on any links.</p>



<h3><strong>Website Visitors</strong></h3>



<p>Like most website operators, Qumu collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Qumu’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Qumu’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Qumu may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>



<p>Qumu also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Qumu does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>



<h3><strong>Gathering and Use of Personal Data</strong></h3>



<p>Certain visitors to Qumu’s websites choose to interact with Qumu in ways that require Qumu to gather personal data (as that term is defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”)). The amount and type of personal data that Qumu gathers depends on the nature of the interaction by you. Qumu typically collects information about visitors, including personal data, in order to provide and improve our Services and to support the advertising and marketing of such Services. For example, we ask visitors who register as Partners at www.qumu.com to provide their name, email address, and company address. In each case, Qumu collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Qumu. Qumu does not disclose personal data other than as described below, and visitors can always refuse to supply personal data, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>



<p>We collect certain information directly from you, such as when you fill out forms with a name or email address or when you otherwise engage with us, such as by phone, email or video-call. We collect other information, usually about devices, browsers, or locations, automatically. We may also collect information about you from other sources, such as licensing the temporary use of a targeted database of contacts who may be interested in our Services.</p>



<p>You have choices about whether you visit our sites, install our apps, or provide information to us. However, if you do not provide us with certain information, you may not be able to use some parts of our Services.</p>



<h3><strong>Information We Collect from You.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">You provide us with information about yourself, including personal data, when you:</p>



<ul><li>Register or log in to your account;</li><li>express an interest in obtaining additional information about our services; request customer support, use our “Contact Us” or similar features; register to use our websites; sign up for an event, webinar or contest;</li><li>Create or edit your user profile;</li><li>Download content from our websites such as marketing collateral and materials;</li><li>Apply for roles or vacancies at Qumu;</li><li>Contact customer support; and/or</li><li>Comment on Qumu Webcasts.</li></ul>



<p>Examples of the information you provide are: name, email address, mailing address, phone number and/or billing information.</p>



<p>If you take part in calls or video calls with one of our sales personnel, then we may record that call for internal training and quality control purposes. You will be informed about the recording at the time of the call. You do not have to take part in the recorded call and if you refuse to join it, you will be sent a separate link to a non-recorded call instead.</p>



<p>If you are applying for a vacancy or job at Qumu then we may (dependent on the location of the vacancy) also collect the following for the purposes of the recruitment process:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Identity Data</strong>, which includes your title, first name, last name, maiden name, date of birth, gender, national insurance number (or equivalent in your country), nationality and other information relating to residency and citizenship which may be required to establish a right to work in a given country;</li><li><strong>Contact Data</strong>, which includes your home address, email address and telephone numbers, emergency contact details and contact details history;</li><li><strong>Historical Data</strong>, which includes educational history and credentials, employment history, skills and qualifications, and results from any other background and disclosure checks in countries where it is lawful to carry out such checks;</li><li><strong>Employment-related Data</strong>, which includes your current remuneration, pension and benefits, third party references (if taken) and interview and assessment feedback created either ourselves following an interview or assessment;</li><li><strong>Verification Data</strong>, which includes a copy of your driving licence, passport, identity card or another form of identification and referee details;</li></ul>



<h3>Where do we send your personal data to for storage or other specific purposes?</h3>



<p>The personal data we collect from you may be transferred outside the UK/EEA either by us and/or by any of the third parties to whom your personal data may be disclosed to as listed in the ‘Who do we share your personal data’ section of this Privacy Policy. Such transfers will occur only where they are necessary as part of: i) the recruitment and/or related intermediary services we provide, e.g. where you apply for a vacancy or position outside the UK/EEA, or where the transfer is authorised by law or ii) in relation to the provision of our products and services to you or your business.</p>



<p>We, our third party data storage providers and/or the third parties to whom we may disclose your personal data, may store your personal data on a server overseas.</p>



<p>If we do transfer your personal data outside the UK/EEA, we will make sure that suitable safeguards are in place in accordance with applicable data protection legislation such as the GDPR, for example by using approved contractual agreements, unless certain exceptions apply, or where we are authorised to do so.</p>



<p>Qumu has implemented an intra-group data transfer agreement with the standard contractual clauses in place to govern the transfer and sharing of any personal data from Qumu’s entity in the United Kingdom to its affiliates in India and the United States of America.</p>



<p>We will provide you with further details of the safeguards that we have implemented if you would like to know what they are.</p>



<h3><strong>Information We Collect Automatically.</strong></h3>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">We automatically collect information from you and your devices when you use our Services, even when you visit our sites or apps without logging in.</p>

<h3>Retention of Personal Data</h3>



<p>Qumu keeps your personal data for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed and originally collected. The length of time for which we retain personal data depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws. Where there are technical limitations that prevent deletion or anonymization, we safeguard personal data and limit active use of it. Qumu has specified data retention policies which govern various subsets of personal data dependent on the original purpose for collection.</p>



<p>After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your personal data will be deleted. If there is any data (which may include personal data) that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will implement appropriate measures to prevent any further use of such data.</p>



<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>



<p>Qumu may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its websites. For instance, Qumu may monitor www.qumu.com site and Qumu may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Qumu does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>



<h3>Protection and Security of Personal Data</h3>



<p>Qumu discloses personal data only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Qumu’s behalf or to provide services available at Qumu’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. Qumu will not rent or sell personal data to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Qumu discloses personal data only when required to do so by law, or when Qumu believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Qumu, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Qumu website and have supplied your email address, Qumu may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Qumu and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Qumu takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of personal data including the use of industry leading physical, electronic, and managerial tools and technologies.</p>



<p>Qumu takes appropriate precautions including organizational, technical, and physical measures to help safeguard against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the personal data we process or use.</p>



<p>While we follow generally accepted standards to protect personal data, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices and signing out of websites after your sessions.</p>



<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>



<p>Qumu’s website, online services and email messages, may use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behaviour and tell us which parts of our website people have visited. Our Cookie Policy is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://qumu.com/legal/">www.qumu.com/legal/</a>.</p>



<p>Qumu uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website. Our goal is to make your experience with Qumu more convenient and personal. For example, if you give us permission to send you and email or you request an email on a specific topic, knowing your contact information helps us send you e-mail that is relevant to you.</p>



<p>If you want to disable cookies, check with your browser provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Qumu website and Qumu Services including the Qumu Cloud Platform will not be available if certain essential cookies are disabled.</p>



<p>As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location), user ID, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data and other technical information.</p>



<p>We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behaviour on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Qumu may use this information in marketing and advertising services.</p>



<p>In some of our email messages, we may use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Qumu website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.<br>Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>



<h3>Mobile Apps</h3>



<p>The Qumu apps only collect personal data for the purposes of the provision of Services to you in the same manner that our products and services collect personal data. Our apps operated in the same manner as our other products and services and process personal data in exactly the same way as our other products (including but not limited to Qumu Cloud Platform and Qumu’s Video Control Center (“<strong>VCC</strong>”).</p>



<p>The Qumu app will store comments and ratings entered by the user and for users of VCC, will track the view count of all videos residing on the VCC server.</p>
