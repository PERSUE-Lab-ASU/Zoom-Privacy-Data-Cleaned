If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer 1.0 or later or Netscape 1.0 or later as your Web browser, your transactions are fully encrypted and secure. When you see either a locked padlock icon (Internet Explorer) or a solid key icon (Netscape) in the lower status bar of your browser window, then your connection is secured through SSL. We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your personal information within our Online Store.

Customer shall provide Brainier with a copy of the materials to be converted in the format as specified on the Customer\u2019s quote submitted to Brainier. Customer should not provide Brainier with the original of the materials to be converted and, in no instance, shall Brainier be liable to Customer for direct damages for loss of, or other damage to, Customer\u2019s materials greater than the cost of the medium on which the materials were transmitted to Brainier. Customers utilizing this service shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Customers shall not post sensitive or inappropriate content including but not limited to adult, misleading, violent, hateful, or harassing. Customer shall retain all rights, including all trademark, licensing and copyright rights, in both the original multimedia materials as well as the streaming media materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-copyright\">Copyright</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your copyright-protected work was posted on Brainier without your authorization, you can submit a copyright removal request to request that the content be removed by contacting Brainier by email or other means provided by the website. Consider whether fair use, fair dealing, or a similar copyright exception applies. Keep in mind that the copyright owner, or an agent authorized to act on the owner\u2019s behalf, should submit the removal request.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-trademark\">Trademark</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think your trademark is being infringed, keep in mind that Brainier does not mediate trademark disputes.

If you cannot reach a resolution with the account holder in question, submit a complaint by contacting Brainier by email or other means provided by the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-defamation\">Defamation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brainier takes into account local legal considerations in our defamation blocking process, and in some cases, we require a court order. For us to be able to process a defamation blocking request, the claim needs to be specific and strongly supported. Because obtaining a court order can be costly and time-consuming, we encourage users to contact the uploaders of the content in question directly. If you have attempted to contact the uploader, and you believe a defamation claim is more appropriate than a privacy or harassment complaint, you may contact Brainier by email or other means provided by the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-links\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brainier may provide you with links to other sites.

These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes.\n\n\n\nIn certain situations, Brainier may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.\n\n\n\nIf Brainier is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.\n\n\n\nFrames\n\n\n\nSome of our pages may utilize framing techniques to serve content to from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to\u00a0www.brainier.com.\n\n\n\nData Security\n\n\n\nBrainier is committed to ensuring the security of your information. We use encryption technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n\n\n\nEvery Brainier employee must abide by our Privacy Policy. Only authorized employees will have access to your personal information and such access is limited to a need-to-know basis.

If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer 1.0 or later or Netscape 1.0 or later as your Web browser, your transactions are fully encrypted and secure. When you see either a locked padlock icon (Internet Explorer) or a solid key icon (Netscape) in the lower status bar of your browser window, then your connection is secured through SSL. We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your personal information within our Online Store. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.\n\n\n\nHandling of Customer\u2019s Media\n\n\n\nBrainier, upon Customer\u2019s request and subject to all payment requirements and contract terms, shall convert, through its own efforts and those of its sub-contractors, Customer\u2019s multimedia materials into a streaming video and/or audio format, or another agreed upon format. Customer shall provide Brainier with a copy of the materials to be converted in the format as specified on the Customer\u2019s quote submitted to Brainier. Customer should not provide Brainier with the original of the materials to be converted and, in no instance, shall Brainier be liable to Customer for direct damages for loss of, or other damage to, Customer\u2019s materials greater than the cost of the medium on which the materials were transmitted to Brainier. Customers utilizing this service shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Customers shall not post sensitive or inappropriate content including but not limited to adult, misleading, violent, hateful, or harassing. Customer shall retain all rights, including all trademark, licensing and copyright rights, in both the original multimedia materials as well as the streaming media materials.\n\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\n\nIf your copyright-protected work was posted on Brainier without your authorization, you can submit a copyright removal request to request that the content be removed by contacting Brainier by email or other means provided by the website. Consider whether fair use, fair dealing, or a similar copyright exception applies. Keep in mind that the copyright owner, or an agent authorized to act on the owner\u2019s behalf, should submit the removal request.\n\n\n\nTrademark\n\n\n\nIf you think your trademark is being infringed, keep in mind that Brainier does not mediate trademark disputes. As a result, we strongly encourage trademark owners to speak directly with the user who posted the content in question. Contacting the uploader may fix the problem faster in a way that benefits everyone. If you cannot reach a resolution with the account holder in question, submit a complaint by contacting Brainier by email or other means provided by the website.\n\n\n\nDefamation\n\n\n\nBrainier takes into account local legal considerations in our defamation blocking process, and in some cases, we require a court order. For us to be able to process a defamation blocking request, the claim needs to be specific and strongly supported. Because obtaining a court order can be costly and time-consuming, we encourage users to contact the uploaders of the content in question directly. If you have attempted to contact the uploader, and you believe a defamation claim is more appropriate than a privacy or harassment complaint, you may contact Brainier by email or other means provided by the website.\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\nBrainier may provide you with links to other sites. Please be aware that Brainier is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites.
