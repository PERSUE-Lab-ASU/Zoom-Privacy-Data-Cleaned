<p><b>California Online Privacy Protection Act</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CalOPPA requires commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers, to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more at: </span><a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this Privacy Policy is created, we will add a link to it on the first significant page after entering our Website and Service Platform.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the Website and Service Platform.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can request to change your Personal Information by emailing us.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>California Privacy Rights</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“</span><b>CCPA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) permits users who are California residents to request to exercise certain rights. If you are a California resident, the CCPA grants you the right to request certain information about our practices with respect to your Personal Information. In particular, you can request to receive information on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The categories and specific pieces of your Personal Information that we have collected.</span></li>
