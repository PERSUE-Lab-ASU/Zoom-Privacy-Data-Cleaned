    <h2>Third party video conferencing integrations</h2>
    <p>
      Learning Loop Mentoring integrates with the Zoom API to make sure that 1:1 video mentor sessions can be carried out in a platform of the mentor's preference. The Learning Loop Mentoring platform shares the start- and end-times of mentor calendar events with the 3rd party video conferencing services so that it can correctly create video conferencing meetings. Mentor access tokens, refresh tokens, User IDs, Meeting IDs, and Meeting URLs are stored in the Learning Loop platform database for as long as the mentor affiliated with the platform. This information is stored in a secured server and transferred over a secured connection and is not shared with fourth parties. Mentor authentication with the mentioned third party video conferencing services happens through the oAuth2 protocol where Client IDs and Client secrets are stored in an encrypted file on the Learning Loop Mentoring platform server.
    </p>

    <h2>Third party mentor calendar integrations</h2>
    <p>
      Learning Loop Mentoring integrates with the Google Calendar API and the Microsoft Outlook Graph API to make sure that available mentor timeslots reflect what is actually available for the mentor in the mentors personal calendar to prevent double-bookings. The Learning Loop Mentoring platform application frequently requests to read all calendar events in the mentors calendar 1,5 months ahead, but only reads and stores the start- and end-times of mentor calendar events, not specific details about the events. Start- and end-times of mentor calendar events are stored (cached) in the Learning Loop Mentoring platform database – on a secured server and transferred over a secured connection and is not shared with fourth parties. When a mentee books a mentor, the Learning Loop Mentoring platform application creates a calendar event through the preferred calendar integration of the mentor (Google Calendar API or the Microsoft Outlook Graph API) on the behalf of the mentor and also includes and shares the requesting mentee email with the mentor through the created calendar event, where the mentee is a participant. If the mentor has chosen Google Meet as his or her preferred video conferencing service, a Google Meet conferencing link is added through the Google Calendar API. If the Zoom video conferencing solution is preferred, at Zoom video conferencing URL is added to the calendar event. Mentor access tokens, refresh tokens, and Meeting URLs are stored in the Learning Loop Mentoring platform database – on a secured server and transferred over a secured connection and is not shared with fourth parties. Mentor authentication with the mentioned third party calendar services happens through the oAuth2 protocol where Client IDs and Client secrets are stored in an encrypted file on the Learning Loop Mentoring platform server.
