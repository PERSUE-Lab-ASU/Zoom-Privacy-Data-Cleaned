<p>We help businesses sell tickets and memberships to their event attendees. We want to be clear about our use of the Personal Data that is entrusted to us.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the “Personal Data” that we collect about you, how we use it, how we share it, your rights and choices, and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. This Policy also outlines your data subject rights, including the right to object to some uses of your Personal Data by us.</p>
<p>Last updated: 13th January 2023</p>
<p>“Tixoom”, “we”, “our” or “us” means Xeio Ltd, a company registered in England and Wales with company number 8134729 doing business as "Tixoom."</p>
<p>“Personal Data” means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, and can include information that you provide to us and that we collect about you, such as when you engage with our Services (e.g. device information, IP address).</p>
<p>“Services” means the products and services that Tixoom indicates are covered by this Policy, which may include Tixoom-provided apps and services. Our “Business Services” are Services provided by Tixoom to entities (“Business Users”) who directly and indirectly provide us with “End Customer” Personal Data in connection with those Business Users’ own business and activities.</p>
<p>“Sites” means Tixoom.app and the other websites, apps and online services that Tixoom indicates are covered by this Policy. Collectively, we refer to Sites, Business Services and End User Services as “Services”.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, “you” means End Customer, Representative or Visitor:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you do business with, or otherwise transact with, a Business User (e.g. when you buy a ticket to an event) but are not directly doing business with Tixoom, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”</li>
<li>When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User (e.g. you are a founder of a company, sole trader, administer an account for a merchant who is a Business User), we refer to you as a “Representative.”</li>
<li>When you visit a Site without being logged into Tixoom or otherwise communicate with Tixoom, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” (e.g. you send Tixoom a message asking for more information because you are considering being a user of our products).</li>
</ul>
<p>The “data controller” is the entity which determines the purposes and means of the data processing taking place. The “data processor” is an entity acting on behalf and under the instructions of a controller in processing personal data. Depending on the activity, Tixoom acts as a “data controller” and/or “data processor (or service provider).”</p>
<p>Tixoom is a data controller when it determines the purposes and means of the processing taking place. These data processing activities include (1) providing the Tixoom service to Business Users, (2) providing information about our services to a Visitor, or (3) analyzing, developing and improving Tixoom's products and services.</p>
<p>Tixoom is a data processor where it is supporting facilitation of transactions on behalf of and at the direction of a Business User who may choose to use our services to support them selling tickets, memberships and similar to their End Customers.</p>
<h4>1. Personal Data that we collect and how we use and share it</h4>
<p>Our collection and use of Personal Data changes depending on whether you are acting as End User, Representative or Visitor and our different Services. For example, if you are the sole owner of a business (i.e., sole proprietorship), we may collect Personal Data to onboard your business, but you may also be an End Customer that purchased goods from another Business User that uses Tixoom services for issuing tickets, handling memberships, or other Business Services.</p>
<p>“Transaction Data” as used in this Privacy Policy includes Personal Data, and may include the following: your name, email address, billing address, shipping address, purchase amount, date of purchase, and in some cases, additional information you provide during the transaction process - for example, your responses to ad hoc questions.</p>
<p>1.1 End Customers</p>
<p>Tixoom offers Business Services to our Business Users (e.g. ability for them to send tickets or memberships and co-ordinate attendance to their events). When we are acting as a Business User’s service provider (also known as a data processor), we will process Personal Data in accordance with the terms of our agreement with the Business User and the Business User’s lawful instructions (e.g. when we help an event organiser issue a ticket to their online event). Our legal basis for the processing of End Customer data is our legitimate interests in providing the Tixoom products and services. Tixoom processes this personal data given its legitimate interest in improving the Services and where it is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract with the Business Users.</p>
<p>Business Users are responsible for making sure that their End Customers’ privacy rights are respected, including ensuring appropriate disclosures about data collection and use that happens in connection with their products and services. If you are an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy or notice of the Business User you choose to do business with for information regarding their privacy practices, choices and controls.</p>
