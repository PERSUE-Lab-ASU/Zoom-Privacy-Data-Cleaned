A cookie is a small data file placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. </p><h3>Types of Cookies</h3><p>Our site may use session cookies, persistent cookies, and web beacons. A “session cookie” expires when you end your session (i.e. close your browser). &nbsp;A “persistent cookie” stores information on your hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A “web beacon” is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image, a redirect URL or JavaScript and is used in conjunction with a cookie. The cookies we place on our server are readable only by us, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on your computer. We may use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your usage of our site and interaction with emails from us. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to our site, in order to improve our site and email communications.</p><h3>Purposes of Cookie use</h3><p>We use Cookies for several purposes. Please see information below on each of these purposes.</p><h4>Preference Cookies</h4><p>We use preference cookies to collect information about your choices and preferences, and to allow us to remember language or other local settings and customize our site accordingly.</p><h4>Analytics Cookies</h4><p>We also use analytics cookies to collect information about your use of our site, and to enable us to improve the way our site works. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our site, help us record any difficulties you have with our site, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on our site, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyse the site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. </p><h4>Marketing Cookies</h4><p>We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the internet. </p><p>We, and third party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our website. Remarketing cookies used by us expire after 30 days. To opt out of Remarketing or to control your ad preferences, please <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p><h4>Controlling Cookies</h4><p>Most web browsers have a “help” menu where you can review how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have your browser alert you when you receive a new cookie or how to fully disable cookies on your browser. You can learn more about cookies at sites like www.aboutcookies.org. If you use your browser settings to block all cookies, you may not be able to access all or parts of our site.</p><h3>Third Party Cookie providers</h3><p>In addition to the cookies that we own, we may also use third-parties cookies on our Sites for the purposes detailed above. </p><p>As the owners of these cookies, you are entitled to information from these third parties regarding their privacy and security policies, and on how to opt-out from their cookies. You can find more information on our third party cookie providers below:</p><div class="w-embed"><table class="privacy-table">
