Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. Remember that your use of Backstage\u2019s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use. </p><h2>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h2><p> This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don\u2019t own or control, or people that we don\u2019t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. </p><p> As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or from individuals residing outside of the United States. If you are under 13 or an individual residing outside of the United States, please do not attempt to use the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 or an individual residing outside the United States, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:hq@meetbackstage.com\" target=\"_blank\"> hq@meetbackstage.com </a> . </p><h2>Will Backstage ever change this Privacy Policy?</h2><p> We\u2019re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Backstage website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you\u2019ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven\u2019t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. </p><h2>What Information does Backstage Collect?</h2><h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3><p> We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Data such as the following: </p><ul><li>First and last name</li><li>Username</li><li>Password</li><li>Email address</li><li>Mailing address</li><li>Telephone number</li><li>Occupation and title</li><li> Employer, company, association or other institutional affiliation </li><li>Financial or payment information</li><li> Anything you upload, post or choose to share (for example, Recordings), which can include Personal Data if you include Personal Data in such content </li></ul><p> Please note that certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. </p><h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3><p> Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include the following: </p><ul><li>IP address</li><li>Device identifiers and information</li><li>Web browser information</li><li>Page view statistics</li><li>Browsing history</li><li>Usage information</li><li> Transaction information (e.g. transaction amount, date and time such transaction occurred) </li><li>Log data (e.g. access times, hardware and software information)</li><li> Location information (e.g. IP address, zip code), including geolocation/GPS data \u2013 for more information, see below </li><li> Cookies and certain other tracking technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixel tags, SDKs, etc.) </li></ul><p> \u201cCookies\u201d are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device\u2019s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren\u2019t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor \u201cDo Not Track\u201d requests you have set using your browser or device. </p><p> We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services \u2013 for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible. </p><h3>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</h3><p> Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services. </p><h3>Information We Receive From Third Party Sources</h3><p> Some third parties such as our business partners and service providers provide us with Personal Data about you, such as the following: </p><h4>Information from our service providers:</h4><p> We may receive information collected by third parties about your use of the Services. For example, we may use analytics service providers to analyze how you interact and engage with the Services and our advertisements, so we can learn and make enhancements to offer you a better experience. Some of these entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, which may include tracking activity across time and unaffiliated properties, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. Third parties may also help us provide you with customer support, and provide us with information so that we may help you use our Services. </p><h4>Account information for third party services:</h4><p> If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (\u201cThird Party Account Information\u201d) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, information from your public profile, if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing. The information we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the third party service. </p><h4>Information from our advertising partners:</h4><p> We may receive information about you from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications. </p><h2>How do we use your Personal Data?</h2><p> We process Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services.

For example, if you\u2019ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services.

We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person. </p><p> If you associated your account with your current employer or if your account is through your Organization, your usage records (including the frequency and duration of your involvement with the Services) may be disclosed to your employer/Organization, but we will not disclose your name or any other personally identifiable information or any specific details regarding the content of your Coaching Services to your employer/Organization without your consent. </p><h3>Service Providers</h3><p> We share Personal Data with vendors and third party service providers who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use.
