<p>In addition to the information that we collect from you directly, we may also receive information about you from other sources, including third parties, business partners, our affiliates, or publicly available sources. Please see the ‘Do Not Track and the Network Advertising Initiative’ section below for how you can attempt to limit third parties who track your information.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> How We Use Information We Collect</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>4.1. We Never Sell Personal Information</b></p>
<p>We will never sell your personal information to any third party.</p>
<p><b>4.2. Use and Processing of Personal Information</b></p>
<p>In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we use your personal information, sometimes combined with non-personal information, in order to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">provide the services, products or information you request from us or that we think you might be interested in;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">personalize or improve your experience with us;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">identify or authenticate you;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">to conduct analytics, generate reports and solve problems;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">manage our relationship with you;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">process order(s) or streamline your checkout and service process; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">carry out internal administrative tasks.</p>
<p><b>4.3. Testimonials</b></p>
<p>We may ask you if we can post a testimonial about an experience you shared with us on our website. Prior to posting any testimonial with your name or other information that you provided to us, we will obtain your consent via email.</p>
<p><b>4.4. Sharing Information</b></p>
<p>In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this policy, we disclose personal information in the following situations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Service Providers</b> – We may share your personal information with service providers. Among other things service providers may help us to administer our website, process payments, conduct surveys, mail communications, and provide technical support. These service providers may collect, store, analyze, or otherwise process information on our behalf.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Affiliates, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Similar Events</b> – We may share your personal information with our corporate affiliates (e.g., parent company, sister companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control). If our company undergoes a merger, divestiture, acquisition, consolidation, asset sale, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our business, we may also share your personal information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Other Disclosures with Your Consent</b> – We may ask if you would like us to share your information with other unaffiliated third parties who are not described elsewhere in this policy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Other Disclosures without Your Consent</b> – We may disclose personal information in response to subpoenas, warrants, court orders, in connection with any legal or regulatory process, or to comply with relevant laws. We may also share your personal information in order to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, for audit purposes, or a violation of our policies (including our Terms of Use — see the ‘About Us’ section above).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Your Options Regarding Your Personal Information</b></li>
</ol>
<p>You can make the following choices regarding your personal information:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Changes to Your Personal Information</b> – We rely on you to update and correct your personal information. Some of our websites allow you to modify or delete your account profile. Some personal information can also be changed by contacting us using the information in the “Contact Us” section above.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Deletion of Your Personal Information</b> – Typically we retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. You may, however, request that we delete your personal information. All requests must be directed to the contact in the “Contact Us” section above. We may also decide to delete your data if we believe that the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or that our continued use and storage are contrary to our obligations to other individuals or third parties. When we delete personal information it will be removed from our active database, but it may remain in archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it. In addition, we may keep your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce any of our agreements.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Revocation of Consent </b>– If you revoke your consent for the processing of personal information then we may no longer be able to provide you certain services. In some cases we may limit or deny your request to revoke consent if the law permits or requires us to do so, if we are unable to adequately verify your identity, or if our processing is not based on your consent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Access to Your Personal information</b> – If required by law, upon request, we will grant reasonable access to personal information that we hold about you. All requests must be directed to the contact in the “Contact Us” section above.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Online Tracking</b> – We do not currently recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “Do Not Track” instructions. For more information about what and how we track, please see the ‘How We Track You’ section below.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Decline to Provide</b> – You may choose not to provide some types of personal information to us. This choice may result in our websites or their functionality not working.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Complaints</b> – Complaints can be sent to us using the contact details listed in the ‘Contact Us’ section above. Some jurisdictions may also allow you to complain to a data protection authority as well.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><b> How We Secure Personal Information</b></li>
</ol>
<p>We use a variety of procedures and precautions to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee or warrant that your personal information is safe from unauthorized access (e.g., hackers or other unauthorized persons / entities) despite our reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any unauthorized access to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p>
<p>All information that you provide to us must travel via infrastructures (e.g., the Internet, mobile networks) or utilize electronic storage means that are not under our control and that you must use at your own risk.</p>
<p>Our website permits you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and strength of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account by immediately contacting us using the information in the “Contact Us” section above.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><b> How We Track You</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>7.1. Cookies</b></p>
<p>We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web server.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, some features and functionality of our website may not operate as expected. If you view our website without changing your cookie settings, you are indicating your consent to receive all cookies from the website.</p>
<p><b>7.2. Log Files</b></p>
<p>We may collect information related to your activity on our websites, such as your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by us for monitoring the operations of our services, to maintain the quality of our services, and to provide general statistics regarding use of our websites.</p>
<p><b>7.3. Clear Gifs and Related Technologies</b></p>
<p>Our website and emails also use pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, or other similar technologies to measure the success of marketing campaigns, to help us manage the operation of our services and to compile statistics about usage and response rates, and other purposes. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of internet users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p><b>7.4. Analytics Services</b></p>
<p>We utilize third party analytic services (e.g., Google Analytics) to help us continually improve our services and track your interactions with our websites. For Google Analytics, you may opt out by visiting the opt-out webpage for Google Analytics (<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>) and installing the applicable add-on for your web browser.</p>
<p><b>7.5. Do Not Track and the Network Advertising Initiative</b></p>
<p>“Do Not Track” refers to a preference you may set in your browser that sends a signal to websites indicating your desire not to be tracked. We do not currently support “Do Not Track” or other similar browser preferences. However, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page located at: <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org">https://optout.networkadvertising.org</a> if you would like to set up opt-out preferences that limit or remove tailored online ads provided by third parties who track your online activity.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><b> Unsubscribing From Our Communications</b></li>
</ol>
<p>You may unsubscribe from our communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our emails. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from email messages related to transactions or other related activities that arise from your continued use of our services (e.g., automatic notifications sent by our system related to your use of features provided by our system).</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><b> Changes To This Privacy Policy</b></li>
</ol>
<p>We may change our privacy policy and practices over time. To the extent that our policy changes in a material way, the policy that was in place at the time that you submitted personal information to us will generally govern that information. Our current Privacy Policy can be found by visiting:<a href="https://www.offeringtree.com/privacy_policy"> https://www.offeringtree.com/privacy_policy</a>.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><b> Minors</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Our websites are not for individuals under age 18. Those individuals should not access the website or provide personal information to us. Additionally, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect information about children. If you believe that we have collected information about a child, please contact us using the information in ‘Contact Information’ above, so that we may delete the information</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><b> Transmission of Data to Other Countries</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Your personal information is processed in the United States, where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country and where the government, courts, or law enforcement may be able to access your information. By submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in the United States.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><b> Third Party Applications and Websites</b></li>
</ol>
<p>We have no control over the privacy practices of websites or applications that we do not own.</p>
