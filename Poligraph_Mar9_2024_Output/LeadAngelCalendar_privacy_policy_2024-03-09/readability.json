Typically, information collected from third parties will include further details on your employer or industry. We may also collect your personal data from a third party website (e.g. LinkedIn)</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"a56ba34\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Use of the LeadAngel Website</h2>\n<p>As is true of most other websites, LeadAngel\u2019s website collects certain information automatically and stores it in log files. The information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet, browser type, operating system and other usage information about the use of LeadAngel\u2019s website, including a history of the pages you view. We use this information to help us design our site to better suit our users\u2019 needs. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, analyze trends, track visitor movements, and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying visitor preferences.</p>\n<p>LeadAngel has a legitimate interest in understanding how members, customers and potential customers use its website. This assists LeadAngel with providing more relevant products and services, with communicating value to our sponsors and corporate members, and with providing appropriate staffing to meet member and customer needs.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"08eafbb\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Cookies and tracking technologies</h2>\n<p>We use cookies and similar technologies on our website. Technically required cookies can also be set without your consent. Other cookies, if set, such as performance and marketing cookies, are only set on the basis of your consent. By clicking \u201cAccept All,\u201d you specifically consent to the use of performance and marketing cookies. At the same time, you grant your consent that your personal data may be transferred to third countries outside the European Union, such as the United States. As a rule, these countries do not offer a comparable level of data protection and privacy, and access by third parties (e.g. local authorities) can therefore not be ruled out. Your consent can be revoked at any time by changing the cookie settings. Further processing of data already collected by the third-party provider before revoking your consent cannot be ruled out. You can find more information in the settings as well as in our Privacy Policy. If you are not prompted for cookie consent, it means only the technically required cookies are set.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"e8f5efb\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Sharing information with third parties</h2>\n<p>The personal information LeadAngel collects from you is stored in one or more databases hosted by third parties located in the United States.

LeadAngel\u2019s data protection officer\u2019s name and contact information are as follows:\nDeepak Kumar\nLeadAngel\u00a0\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow we collect and use (process) your personal information\nLeadAngel collects personal information about its website visitors and customers. With a few exceptions, this information is generally limited to:\n\nName\nJob title\nEmployer name\nWork address\nEmail\nPhone number\n\nWe use this information to provide prospects and customers with services.\nWe do not sell personal information to anyone and only share it with third parties who are facilitating the delivery of our services.\nFrom time to time, LeadAngel receives personal information about individuals from third parties. Typically, information collected from third parties will include further details on your employer or industry. We may also collect your personal data from a third party website (e.g. LinkedIn)\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse of the LeadAngel Website\nAs is true of most other websites, LeadAngel\u2019s website collects certain information automatically and stores it in log files. The information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet, browser type, operating system and other usage information about the use of LeadAngel\u2019s website, including a history of the pages you view. We use this information to help us design our site to better suit our users\u2019 needs. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, analyze trends, track visitor movements, and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying visitor preferences.\nLeadAngel has a legitimate interest in understanding how members, customers and potential customers use its website. This assists LeadAngel with providing more relevant products and services, with communicating value to our sponsors and corporate members, and with providing appropriate staffing to meet member and customer needs.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCookies and tracking technologies\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our website. Technically required cookies can also be set without your consent. Other cookies, if set, such as performance and marketing cookies, are only set on the basis of your consent. By clicking \u201cAccept All,\u201d you specifically consent to the use of performance and marketing cookies. At the same time, you grant your consent that your personal data may be transferred to third countries outside the European Union, such as the United States. As a rule, these countries do not offer a comparable level of data protection and privacy, and access by third parties (e.g. local authorities) can therefore not be ruled out. Your consent can be revoked at any time by changing the cookie settings. Further processing of data already collected by the third-party provider before revoking your consent cannot be ruled out. You can find more information in the settings as well as in our Privacy Policy. If you are not prompted for cookie consent, it means only the technically required cookies are set.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSharing information with third parties\nThe personal information LeadAngel collects from you is stored in one or more databases hosted by third parties located in the United States. These third parties do not use or have access to your personal information for any purpose other than cloud storage and retrieval. On occasion, LeadAngel engages third parties to send information to you, including information about our products, services, and events.\nA list of our third party sub processors can be found\u00a0here\nWe do not otherwise reveal your personal data to non-LeadAngel persons or businesses for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) it\u2019s in connection with LeadAngel-hosted and LeadAngel co-sponsored conferences as described above; (3) the information is provided to comply with the law (for example, compelled by law enforcement to comply with a search warrant, subpoena, or court order), enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (5) to address emergencies or acts of God; or (6) to address disputes, claims, or to persons demonstrating legal authority to act on your behalf. We may also gather aggregated data about our services and website visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated (but not personally identifiable) information to our partners, service providers, advertisers, and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.\nThe LeadAngel website connects with third party services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and others. If you choose to share information from the LeadAngel website through these services, you should review the privacy policy of that service. If you are a member of a third party service, the aforementioned connections may allow that service to connect your visit to our site to your personal data.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTransferring personal data to the U.S.\nLeadAngel has its headquarters in the United States. Information we collect about you will be processed in the United States. By using LeadAngel\u2019s services, you acknowledge that your personal information will be processed in the United States. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of \u201cadequacy\u201d from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR.
