In such cases, sharing such data means that the administrator(s) or other users of the same account may access it on behalf of the customer, and will be able to monitor, process and analyze the Personal Data contained therein.

For example, we may send you notifications (through any of the means available to us) of changes or updates to our Services, billing issues, service changes, log-in attempts or password reset notices, etc. Our customers, and other users on the same customer account, may also send you notifications, messages and other updates regarding their or your use of the Services. Such notifications and messages may also be sent by them to their own customers (for example, invites, recordings or meeting summaries created through our Services). You can typically control your communications and notifications settings from your Sybill User profile settings, or otherwise in accordance with the instructions included in the communications sent to you. Please note that you will not be able to opt-out of receiving certain service communications which are integral to your use (like password resets or billing notices).<br><br>Promotional Communications: We may also notify you about new features, additional offerings, events, special opportunities or any other information we think you will find valuable, as our customer, user or prospect.

To exercise these rights, individuals may contact us at privacy@sybill.ai. We will respond to all data access, deletion, and transfer requests in a timely manner, and we will take all necessary steps to comply with the request, subject to any legal or contractual obligations that may limit our ability to do so.

In order to help us comply with your request, please provide as much information as you can about the specific data you are seeking and the context in which it was provided.<br><br>In addition, we will provide customers with a mechanism to access, delete or transfer their Personal Data through our platform, if this is feasible from a technical and operational standpoint. If it is not feasible, we will provide individuals with an explanation for the same.<br>‍<br>Please note that when you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal information related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access. Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g. as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 4 above.<br><br>We may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data related to others.<br><br>If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data that we process on our customer’s behalf, please contact the administrator of such customer’s account directly. For example, if you are our customer’s customer or prospect, or if you are a user of Sybill on behalf of our customer, and wish to access, correct, or delete data processed by Sybill on behalf of our customer, please direct your request to the relevant customer (who is the “data controller” of such data – see Section 10 below).

Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.<br><br>Sybill is the “data controller” of Sybill Website, CRM &amp; Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of the data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of “data processor”.<br><br>Sybill is the “data processor” of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the “data controller” of such data; and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the “sub-processors” of such data.<br><br>Sybill is both a “data controller” and “data processor” of Sybill User Data. Such data is processed by Sybill for its own purposes (as described in Section 2 above), as an independent ‘controller’; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customer’s behalf, as a ‘processor’.<br><br>Accordingly, Sybill processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with such customer’s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer. The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).<br><br>For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data – including sufficient reference to the processing of their Personal Data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws</p></li><li><p><strong class="bold-text-header">Additional Notices</strong></p><p class="paragraph-list">Updates and Amendments: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version of our Services.
