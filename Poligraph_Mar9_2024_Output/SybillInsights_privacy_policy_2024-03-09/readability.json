In order to help us comply with your request, please provide as much information as you can about the specific data you are seeking and the context in which it was provided.\u00a0\u200dIn addition, we will provide customers with a mechanism to access, delete or transfer their Personal Data through our platform, if this is feasible from a technical and operational standpoint. If it is not feasible, we will provide individuals with an explanation for the same.Please note that when you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal information related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access. Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g. as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section \u200e\u200e4 above.We may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data related to others.If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data that we process on our customer\u2019s behalf, please contact the administrator of such customer\u2019s account directly. For example, if you are our customer\u2019s customer or prospect, or if you are a user of Sybill on behalf of our customer, and wish to access, correct, or delete data processed by Sybill on behalf of our customer, please direct your request to the relevant customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data \u2013 see Section \u200e\u200e10 below). Note that if you do contact us, we may share your communications with our customer and its account users; and that we may also share the contact details of the account administrator with individuals who sent us such a request or query relating to this account.Data Controller/ProcessorCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201cdata controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cdata processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.Sybill is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of Sybill Website, CRM & Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of the data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cdata processor\u201d.Sybill is the \u201cdata processor\u201d of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data; and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201csub-processors\u201d of such data.Sybill is both a \u201cdata controller\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d of Sybill User Data. Such data is processed by Sybill for its own purposes (as described in Section \u200e2 above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.Accordingly, Sybill processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with such customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer. The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data \u2013 including sufficient reference to the processing of their Personal Data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.Additional NoticesUpdates and Amendments: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version of our Services.

If it is not feasible, we will provide individuals with an explanation for the same.\u200dPlease note that when you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal information related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access. Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g. as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 4 above.We may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data related to others.If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data that we process on our customer\u2019s behalf, please contact the administrator of such customer\u2019s account directly. For example, if you are our customer\u2019s customer or prospect, or if you are a user of Sybill on behalf of our customer, and wish to access, correct, or delete data processed by Sybill on behalf of our customer, please direct your request to the relevant customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data \u2013 see Section 10 below). Note that if you do contact us, we may share your communications with our customer and its account users; and that we may also share the contact details of the account administrator with individuals who sent us such a request or query relating to this account.Data Controller/Processor Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201cdata controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cdata processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.Sybill is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of Sybill Website, CRM & Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of the data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cdata processor\u201d.Sybill is the \u201cdata processor\u201d of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data; and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201csub-processors\u201d of such data.Sybill is both a \u201cdata controller\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d of Sybill User Data. Such data is processed by Sybill for its own purposes (as described in Section 2 above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.Accordingly, Sybill processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with such customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer. The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data \u2013 including sufficient reference to the processing of their Personal Data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such lawsUpdates and Amendments: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version of our Services.
