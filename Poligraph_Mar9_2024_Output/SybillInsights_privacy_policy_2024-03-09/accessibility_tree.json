Service Providers: We may engage selected third party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own. Such service providers include hosting and server co-location services, communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), speech-to-text services, expression analytics, data and cyber security services, billing and payment processing services, fraud detection and prevention services, web analytics, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, social and advertising networks, content providers, e-mail, voicemails, support and customer relation management systems, and our legal, financial and compliance advisors (collectively, \u201cService Providers\u201c).

Accordingly, these Service Providers may have access to Sybill User Data and Website, CRM & Prospect Data; and if we have expressly listed them in our Sub-Processor List, they may also have access to Customer Data \u2014 all depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services, and may only use it for such limited purposes as determined in our agreements with them.

Such websites and third party services, and any information you process, submit, transmit or otherwise use with such websites and third party services, are governed by such third party\u2019s terms and privacy practices and policies, and not by this Privacy Policy.
