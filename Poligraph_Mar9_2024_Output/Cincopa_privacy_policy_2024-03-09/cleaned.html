	<h1>Cincopa.com Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>
		<b>
			<span style="font-size:18.0pt">
				(Last Updated: March 14, 2022)
			</span>
		</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		By using the Site or the
		Products available through the www.cincopa.com Site (the "Product"),
		you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.
	</p>

	<p>
		We reserve the right to
		change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy,
		we will post a new policy on our Site and update the “last updated” date set
		forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use
		the Product to see if it has been updated since your last visit.
	</p>

	<h2>Information Collected</h2>

	<p>
		<b>GDPR-compliant</b>
		<br>Cincopa is a GDPR-compliant, for more information visit 
		<a href="/help/cincopa-gdpr-compliance-data-privacy-faq/">Cincopa GDPR Compliance &amp; Data Privacy FAQ</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>CCPA-compliant</b>
		<br>
		On June 28, 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was signed into law. 
		Becoming effective on January 1, 2020, the CCPA introduces many of the rights from the GDPR to California residents.
		Cincopa is CCPA-compliant and, as part of our commitment to protecting the privacy of our users.
		Cincopa complies with the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" - Cincopa will not sell any of your personal infromation.
	</p>
	<p>
		A major part of GDPR and the CCPA is the rights granted to EU residents and California residents
		in regards to their personal data and information.
		Under GDPR, a user has the right to access their data (in a commonly-used and machine-readable format), 
		the right to be forgotten (have all of their personal data erased), 
		the right to object to the processing of their data, the right to withdraw their consent to the 
		processing of their data, and the right to know certain information about their data 
		(like the categories of data collected and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom their data has been disclosed), 
		subject to certain conditions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Similarly, under the CCPA, a user has the right to access their personal information 
		(in a portable and readily usable format), the right to the deletion of their personal information, 
		the right to prohibit businesses from selling their personal information, and the right to know certain 
		information about their data (like the specific pieces of information about the user and the categories of 
		third parties to whom the business has sold or disclosed their personal information), subject to certain conditions.
	</p>

	<p>
		We collect two basic
		types of information with our Product, namely personal information and
		aggregate information.&nbsp; As used herein, the term "personal
		information" means information that specifically identifies an individual
		(such as a name and e-mail address), and demographic and other information
		about an individual when directly linked to personally identifiable
		information.&nbsp; A user name may be personal information if it includes
		personally identifying information such as a first <span class="GramE">and</span>
		last name.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our definition of
		personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate
		information is data we collect about a group or category or users
		from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words,
		information on how you use our Product may be collected and combined with
		information about how others use the Product, but no personal information will
		be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in
		our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise
		tailor our Product.&nbsp; This policy in no way restricts or limits our
		collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate
		information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including
		to help us better understand and improve our Product, and for advertising and
		marketing purposes.
	</p>

	<p>
		Those are the types of
		personal and other information we collect. You should refer to the rest of this
		Policy to see how we use, disclose and protect this information
	</p>

	<p>
		<u>
			Information You Give
			Us.
		</u>
	</p>

	<p>
		We collect information
		you give us at various times when you register with us and use our Product.
		Examples include the following:
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="GramE">
			Registration
			and Transaction Information.
		</span>&nbsp; When you register to use the Product,
		we may collect various kinds of contact information about you including, for
		example, your name and e-mail address.&nbsp; We may also collect demographic
		information that you provide to us.&nbsp; You will also be asked to create a
		user-chosen ID and password for your use when accessing the Product.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="GramE">
			Submissions
			and Customer Service.
		</span>&nbsp; From time-to-time we may post surveys,
		contests or sweepstakes on our Product, which may request personal or
		demographic information and customer feedback.&nbsp; Participation in these
		requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice
		of whether or not to participate and disclose information.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="GramE">
			<u>
				Automatically
				Collected Information.
			</u>
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		We automatically receive
		certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when
		you use the Product, our systems may automatically collect your IP address and
		the type of operating system or browser you use. We may also collect
		information pertaining to your account activity, information pertaining to the
		files accessed or used by you, and standard access information, such as the
		time and date of accessing the Product, and usage of the Product.&nbsp; We use
		such information to help manage the effectiveness of our online advertising and
		to gather access information, for purposes such as compiling aggregated
		statistics about Product usage.
	</p>

	<p>
		We may also use cookie
		technology to collect information.&nbsp; Among other things, the use of cookies
		enables us to improve our Site by seeing which areas and features are most
		popular; to count the number of computers accessing the Site; to personalize
		the Site and improve the Site experience; to record your preferences; and to
		allow you to visit the Site without re-entering your member ID and/or password.
		A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique
		identifier, which is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and
		stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept
		cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or
		to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing
		browser options.&nbsp; However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if
		a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the Product may not
		function properly.&nbsp; For example, you may not be able to sign in and may
		not be able to access certain Site features or Products.
	</p>

	<p>
		<u>
			No Information about
			Children.
		</u>
	</p>

	<p>
		Our Product is not
		intended to be used by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly,
		directly or passively, collect information from children under the age of 13.
		If we create offers and products that make it appropriate to collect
		information from children under the age of 13, we will notify you of the change
		in this Policy.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="GramE"><b><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Use and Sharing of Information.</span></b></span><b>

	<p>
		<span class="GramE">
			<u>
				Internal
				Use of Personal information.
			</u>
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		In general, we use
		personal information internally to process your requests or transactions, to
		provide you with information or support you request, to inform you about other
		information, events, promotions or products we think will be of
		interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and
		operation of, the Site and to otherwise serve our users and enable them to take
		maximum advantage of our Product. For example, personal information may be
		used:
	</p>

	<ul type="disc">
		<li>
			to request feedback
			and to enable us to develop, customize and improve the Site and our
			publications and products;
		</li>
		<li>
			to conduct marketing
			analysis, to send you surveys or newsletters, to contact you about
			a third party's services, products, activities, special events or offers
			and for other marketing, informational, product development and
			promotional purposes;
		</li>
		<li>
			to send you a
			welcoming email and to contact you about your use of the Site, to respond
			to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints, to perform
			after-sales activities, to anticipate and resolve problems with our Product,
			to respond to customer support inquiries, for assistance with our product
			and site development, and to create and inform you of new products
			from Cincopa.com that better meet your needs;
		</li>
		<li>
			to notify contest
			winners; and
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="GramE">for</span>
			the specific purpose for which the information was provided.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You should review the
		following section to understand when Cincopa.com discloses personal information
		to non-affiliated third parties.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="GramE">
			<u>
				Disclosure of Personal Information to third Parties.
			</u>
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		Cincopa.com reserves the
		right to share aggregated demographic information about our customers, sales,
		and traffic to our partners and advertisers. We will not give, sell, rent,
		share, or trade any of your personally identifiable information, or the data
		that you store using our Product to any third party, except as outlined in our
		Terms of Use and in this privacy policy. We reserve the right to disclose
		such information to a third party only if (a) we have your express written
		consent, (b) we reasonably believe we are compelled by applicable state and
		federal laws, or (c) we reasonably believe that an emergency involving
		immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person, or other
		irreparable injury, including economic interests of a third party, requires
		disclosure of the information without delay.
	</p>

	<p>
		Cincopa.com uses a third
		party vendor to manage all credit card processing, and
		may partner with other parties to provide specific services. Upon registration
		with Cincopa.com, we will share names and other contact information as
		necessary for the applicable third parties to provide these services. These
		parties are not permitted under their contract with us to store, retain, or use
		your information for purposes not directly involved with their service to Cincopa.com.
		Specifically, our contracts with such third parties prohibit the third parties
		from using your personal information for purposes of marketing or promotions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Notwithstanding the
		foregoing, we reserve the right to share personally identifiable information in
		connection with an acquisition, merger, or sale of all or a substantial portion
		of our business, with or to a company in a substantially similar business,
		provided that the other company agrees to comply with this or with a reasonably
		<span class="GramE">comparable</span> privacy policy. In the event of any such
		sale or merger, you will receive notice of any changes in such policy.
	</p>

	<h2>Network and Information Security</h2>

	<p>
		Reasonable effort will
		be taken to prevent unauthorized release, corruption, or loss of <span class="GramE">your</span> personal and project data. For example, we limit which
		employees at Cincopa.com have access to your personally identifiable
		information. Specifically, only employees who require your personally
		identifiable information to perform a specific task are granted access to such
		information. In addition, user data is protected with SSL encryption for
		transmission to Cincopa.com. No customer information is stored on Cincopa.com
		employees' personal computers.
	</p>

	<p>
		The servers on which all
		customer data and information is stored are kept in a secure environment, and
		may be archived elsewhere.&nbsp; Our records are stored indefinitely, as are
		our archival backup copies.&nbsp; While we have taken efforts to guard your
		personal information, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be
		disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts
		of others.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your account information
		and access to our Product is accessible only through the use of an individual
		user ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information,
		you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other
		person. You are responsible for all uses of our Site and Product by any person
		using your account user ID and password. Please advise us immediately if you
		believe your account user ID and password have been misused. In addition,
		always logout and close your browser when you finish your session. Please note
		that we will never ask you to disclose your password in an unsolicited phone
		call or email.
	</p>

	<p>
		To date, we have never
		had a situation in which to our knowledge any of our users' personal
		information has been compromised in any way, or in which any user's personal
		information has become public. If Cincopa.com learns of a security systems
		breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take
		appropriate protective steps. Cincopa.com may also post a notice on the Site if
		a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal
		right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free
		written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at support@cincopa.com.

		identifiable information changes in any way, we request that you provide us the
		means to correct or update this information as soon as possible. To do so,
