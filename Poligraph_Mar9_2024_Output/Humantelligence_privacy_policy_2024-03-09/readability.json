Cookies are most often used to track specific information regarding your activity on a particular website or online service.\n            </p><p>\n            \n            When you visit our Services, we place a Cookie in a directory of your computer's hard drive. The information that Cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit and your registration information. Cookies offer you many conveniences for our Services. For example, they allow HT to recognize certain information, such as your browser type, so we know if you can view certain plug-ins like Macromedia Flash files.

A temporary or \"session\" Cookie is placed on your computer during your visit to any of our Services and is deleted when you exit your Internet browser and/or turn off your computer. A permanent or \"persistent\" Cookie means that the Cookie stays on your hard drive until you delete it. You can delete our permanent Cookie at any time by following the instructions contained in your browser's help file, or by contacting the company providing your browser's technical support. HT does not use cookies to store information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers or any other highly sensitive personal information.\n            </p><p>\n            \n            HT may also use flash cookies which are sometimes called local shared objects.

STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION\n\n        \n            We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.  \n            \nWe will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than two years past the termination of the user's account. \n\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n\nWe aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.  We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure.

COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS\n\n        \n            Cookies are small data files that a website transfers to your browser when you visit a website. Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about website usage, e-mail response and tracking. For the sake of ease, we use \"Cookies\" to describe both traditional cookies and web beacons.\n            \n            \n            We may use Cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.  The use of Cookies is a standard practice among websites and online services. A Cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer to uniquely distinguish your visit to a website or use of an online service. Cookies are most often used to track specific information regarding your activity on a particular website or online service.\n            \n            \n            When you visit our Services, we place a Cookie in a directory of your computer's hard drive. The information that Cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit and your registration information. Cookies offer you many conveniences for our Services. For example, they allow HT to recognize certain information, such as your browser type, so we know if you can view certain plug-ins like Macromedia Flash files. They also allow us to streamline your visit to the Services based on your previous visits.\n            \n            \n            Cookies may be either permanent or temporary. HT uses both temporary and permanent cookies. A temporary or \"session\" Cookie is placed on your computer during your visit to any of our Services and is deleted when you exit your Internet browser and/or turn off your computer. A permanent or \"persistent\" Cookie means that the Cookie stays on your hard drive until you delete it. You can delete our permanent Cookie at any time by following the instructions contained in your browser's help file, or by contacting the company providing your browser's technical support. HT does not use cookies to store information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers or any other highly sensitive personal information.\n            \n            \n            HT may also use flash cookies which are sometimes called local shared objects. Flash Cookies are data files that are stored on your computer by the websites that you visit. You can read more about Flash Cookies at Adobe's (the owner) website.

Neither HT, nor any of its parent, officers, directors, partners, affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, agents, representatives, vendors or suppliers is responsible for the content, privacy policies, products, services, reliability, viewpoint or accuracy of information on any such websites. We do not control and are not responsible for the collection of personal information by third party websites, including websites owned or controlled by our preferred financial partners, advertisers, vendors and/or websites not controlled or authorized by HT. Third party websites that are accessed through links on our Service or integrations with other websites have separate privacy policies.

SECURITY\n\n        \n            The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access and improper use. HT makes access to your personal information subject to certain security measures, including technological controls such as \"firewalls,\" in accordance with industry standards. When the use of an HT web page involves the transmission of personal information or confidential information, HT may use Secure Socket Layer (\"SSL\") technology to establish a secure connection between your computer and HT. SSL allows the transmission of encrypted information from your computer to HT and back again and is currently the industry standard for Internet platform security. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so while HT strives to protect your personal information, HT cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you voluntarily give to HT.\n\nHT reserves the right to monitor all network traffic to our Services to identify and/or block unauthorized attempts or intrusions to upload or change information or cause damage to any of our Services in any manner. Anyone using any of our Services expressly consents to such monitoring.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        14.
