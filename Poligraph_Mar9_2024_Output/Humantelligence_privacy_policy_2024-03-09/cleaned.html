        <h4>8.  COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</h4>

        <p class="addlevel">
            Cookies are small data files that a website transfers to your browser when you visit a website. Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about website usage, e-mail response and tracking. For the sake of ease, we use "Cookies" to describe both traditional cookies and web beacons.
            <br>
            <br>
            We may use Cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.  The use of Cookies is a standard practice among websites and online services. A Cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer to uniquely distinguish your visit to a website or use of an online service. Cookies are most often used to track specific information regarding your activity on a particular website or online service.
            <br>
            <br>
            When you visit our Services, we place a Cookie in a directory of your computer's hard drive. The information that Cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit and your registration information. Cookies offer you many conveniences for our Services. For example, they allow HT to recognize certain information, such as your browser type, so we know if you can view certain plug-ins like Macromedia Flash files. They also allow us to streamline your visit to the Services based on your previous visits.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cookies may be either permanent or temporary. HT uses both temporary and permanent cookies. A temporary or "session" Cookie is placed on your computer during your visit to any of our Services and is deleted when you exit your Internet browser and/or turn off your computer. A permanent or "persistent" Cookie means that the Cookie stays on your hard drive until you delete it. You can delete our permanent Cookie at any time by following the instructions contained in your browser's help file, or by contacting the company providing your browser's technical support. HT does not use cookies to store information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers or any other highly sensitive personal information.
            <br>
            <br>
            HT may also use flash cookies which are sometimes called local shared objects. Flash Cookies are data files that are stored on your computer by the websites that you visit. You can read more about Flash Cookies at Adobe's (the owner) website. We may use Flash Cookies to enable or control Flash-based content in the Services. Flash Cookies provide similar functionality as permanent Cookies and are persistent and do not go away when you exit your browser or turn off your computer. You can learn how to manage Flash Cookie settings and preferences for your computer by learning about how to use the Settings Manager on Adobe's website.
            <br><br>
            You may configure your browser to accept or deny Cookies from our Services. However, disabling or denying Cookies from our Services may render parts of them inaccessible or may cause certain web pages not to properly load. There are also several services and websites which allow you to visit websites, including our Services anonymously. Again, you may not be able to access or use all of the web pages for the Services if you use these anonymizing services or websites, and if you have an Account, you will not be able to your Account via these anonymizing services or websites.

        <h4>13. SECURITY</h4>

        <p class="addlevel">
            The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access and improper use. HT makes access to your personal information subject to certain security measures, including technological controls such as "firewalls," in accordance with industry standards. When the use of an HT web page involves the transmission of personal information or confidential information, HT may use Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology to establish a secure connection between your computer and HT. SSL allows the transmission of encrypted information from your computer to HT and back again and is currently the industry standard for Internet platform security. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. <br><br>

<u>Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so while HT strives to protect your personal information, HT cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you voluntarily give to HT.</u><br><br>

HT reserves the right to monitor all network traffic to our Services to identify and/or block unauthorized attempts or intrusions to upload or change information or cause damage to any of our Services in any manner. Anyone using any of our Services expressly consents to such monitoring.
