For example, when you enter personal information (such as your contact information) on our online forms, we encrypt that information using transport layer security (TLS). We also follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Risk of Interception</strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out Personal Data online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that Data. While we strive to protect your Personal Data and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. We cannot guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through your use of the Services, and any Personal Data, general information, or other data or information is provided to us at your own risk.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How Long We Keep Your Information&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a general rule, we retain your Personal Data for as long as you have an account, and for up to three years thereafter. If you are not a user from a Designated Country, we may retain a back-up copy of your Private or Public User Content potentially with Personal Data in it, indefinitely. We will only retain your information to the extent:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">it is needed for the purposes which we have conveyed to you;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">we are required by law to maintain such information; or</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">it is needed for us to address any issues or inquiries that you may have;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">the processing purpose constitutes a legitimate interest.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We dispose of Personal Data by destroying it, erasing it or anonymizing it.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We may retain logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics); your email address; your tax information; communications with you; and your transactional information (for auditing, tax, and financial purposes). When we no longer have a legitimate business interest in retaining data, we will delete or anonymize it.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you delete your account, a presentation or a video we may not be able to recover it. If you have previously made a presentation or a video public, the presentation or the video or its parts, including the incorporated data, may still be discoverable via search engines and similar online resources. We have no control over search engines; however, you may send a request for deletion to major search engines in some cases.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If we receive legal process pertaining to your account or have other legal document retention requirements, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with our preservation obligations. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your Personal Data to defend or assert our rights.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cross-Border Data Transfers</strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In accordance with the GDPR and other applicable privacy laws, we may transfer your Personal Data from your country of residence to the U.S. (or other countries) and we process data both inside and outside of the United States and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders (e.g. Binding Corporate Rules or Standard Contractual Clauses).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may have laws that are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your country of residence.
