We provide our clients with the ability to create profiles of their Participants in order to conduct research with them, and the ability to export information, at our client's direction, to other applications. To do this, our clients integrate our technology into their applications, websites, or other online services.</p>\n                <p>Our clients' collection, use, and disclosure of data is separately governed by their privacy policies. Our clients may collect information about their users directly; in that case, each of our clients is responsible for ensuring that their data collection follows their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>\n                <h4>Collection</h4>\n                <p>In the course of providing Services to our clients, Qualitative.io collects personally identifiable information (\"PII\") about Participants of our clients. Qualitative.io uses this information to provide our Services to our clients.</p>\n                <p>PII is information that is linked or linkable to you. The PII we collect may include name, phone number, or email address, which you may have provided to our client. Qualitative.io takes precautions not to collect, and, if discovered, will not retain passwords, credit card details, and certain other information submitted through our services.</p>\n                <p>We may automatically collect information about your use, navigation of, and interactions with our clients' applications, websites, or other online services when our client has installed our technology on its properties.</p>\n                <p>Qualitative.io retains standard web log data 5 years after you visit a client's website, and aggregations and reports for up to 10 years after you visit a client's website.</p>\n                <h4>Use And Disclosure</h4>\n                <p>We collect information about Participants at our clients' direction. We do this to provide our Services, which enable our clients to optimize their communications with, and understanding of, their Participants. We consider our clients' Participants' information to be confidential to that client. Accordingly, we do not disclose Participant information to unaffiliated third parties except in response to our clients' explicit instructions, as provided for in an agreement between us and our client, or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy (for example, as necessary to respond to legal requirements).</p>\n                <p>Qualitative.io may provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. We may share Participant information collected from our clients that is related to such transactions with those affiliated businesses. We require our affiliates, via contract, to provide the same level of privacy protection as set forth in this policy and they do not have the right to share or use PII for any purpose other than for an authorized transaction.</p>\n                <p>If we ever were to engage in any onward transfers of your data with third parties for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized, we would provide you with an opt-out choice to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data.</p>\n                <h4>Collection, Use, And Disclosure Of Information From Our Clients</h4>\n                <p>This section describes our policies for our clients' use of the Qualitative.io Site and Services.</p>\n                <h4>Information Clients Provide To Us </h4>\n                <p>We receive and store any information clients enter on the Site, through the Services, or provide to us in any other way. Clients can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then they may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use clients' PII for such purposes as responding to their requests for Services, customizing the content they see, communicating with them about our products, and marketing our Services to them.</p>\n                <p>In order for clients to use all of our features, they must register with Qualitative.io. We require clients' e-mail credentials during the registration process.</p>\n                <p>Further information may be required if clients choose to purchase paid components of the Services, such as credit card and billing information. Qualitative.io uses third party partners for credit card processing who may require and store your credit card and billing information.</p>\n                <h4>E-Mail Communications</h4>\n                <p>If a client purchases Qualitative.io's online tools to recruit participants and conduct research, Qualitative.io will communicate with it about the services it purchases by e-mail. Clients consent to receiving such confirmations by e-mail. If clients contact us via e-mail, we may retain a record of their contact information and any information they provide us in their messages to respond to them. We may receive a confirmation when clients open an e-mail from Qualitative.io.</p>\n                <p>We may also send e-mails with news or promotions. If clients do not want to receive news or promotional e-mail from us, please contact us at privacy@qualitative.io (this will not affect e-mails related to certain important, legal, or service-related messages such as outage information).</p>\n                <h4>Information From Other Sources</h4>\n                <p>To improve our Services, we may receive information about clients from other sources and add it to our account information. Like the information clients provide to us, we do not share this information with anyone except authorized third parties in connection with providing clients with our Services.</p>\n                <p>We do not disclose clients' information to unaffiliated third parties without clients' consent, or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy (for example, as necessary to respond to legal requirements).</p>\n                <h4>Other Important Information</h4>\n                <h5>Your California Privacy Rights</h5>\n                <p>If you are a California resident, California law permits you to request certain information regarding the disclosure of your PII by us and our related companies to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send your request, by mail or email, to the addresses listed at the end of this policy.</p>\n                <h5>Agents</h5>\n                <p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share client and Participant information with them to provide products and services. Examples include billing, processing payments, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. Our agents use the same level of privacy protection as we do. Unless we tell you differently, Qualitative.io does not share, and Qualitative.io's agents do not have any right to use, PII collected from our Site and Services beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>\n                <h5>Business Transfers</h5>\n                <p>In some cases, we may change our ownership or corporate organization, or may choose to buy or sell assets. Participant information may be transferred to another entity, its affiliates, or service providers in connection with the transaction. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that Qualitative.io or its successor organization may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy.</p>\n                <h5>Protection Of Qualitative.io And Others</h5>\n                <p>We may release PII when we in our sole discretion believe in good faith that release is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Qualitative.io, our employees, our clients, or others. We also may be required to disclose an individual's PII in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>\n                <h5>Information Security</h5>\n                <p>Clients' Qualitative.io account information is protected by an OAuth token for your privacy and security as well as other reasonable security measures. We use reasonable safeguards to protect the security of clients' information during transmission, including by encrypting all of the information clients input. Only employees or agents who need PII to perform a specific job are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p>\n                <p>While Qualitative.io uses commercially reasonable means to secure information provided to us, we do not guarantee that such information will not be improperly accessed, disclosed, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. Clients and Participants are responsible for the security of their information that is transmitted to us or that is viewed, downloaded, or otherwise accessed when using unencrypted, public or otherwise unsecured networks. </p>\n                <h5>Accessing Information </h5>\n                <p>You are able to access, add to, update, correct, amend, or delete certain information about you, including PII. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. A client may deactivate its Qualitative.io account by following the deactivation process set forth on the Site. Some information may remain in our records after account deletion. Please contact us at privacy@qualitative.io if you have questions or concerns about accessing, correcting, or deleting your PII.</p>\n                <p>EU and Swiss data subjects have a right to access their information. Please see the EU-U.S. Data Privacy and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks section below.</p>\n                <h5>Conditions Of Use</h5>\n                <p>Your use of the Site and Services and any possible dispute over privacy are subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including limitations on damages, dispute resolution, and application of New York state law.</p>\n                <h5>International Users (Except For EU And Swiss Data Subjects)</h5>\n                <p>If you use our Websites outside of the United States, you understand and consent to the transfer of your personal information to, and the collection, processing, and storage of your personal information in, the United States and elsewhere. The laws in the U.S. and these countries regarding personal information may be different than the laws of your state or country.</p>\n                <h5>Use Of Qualitative.io's Site By Children</h5>\n                <p>Qualitative.io's Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we will not knowingly collect or use any PII from children that we know to be under the age of 18. If we become aware of PII in our database that was collected from a child under 18, we will delete such information. </p>\n                <h5>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h5>\n                <p>Qualitative.io may amend this Privacy Policy. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make material changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by sending you an email thirty (30) days before the changes take effect and by posting a notice on client dashboards on the Site.</p>\n                <h4>EU-U.S. Data Privacy and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks</h4>\n                <h5>Definitions</h5>\n                <p>For purposes of this section only, the following definitions shall apply:</p>\n                <p>\"Agent\" means any third party that collects or uses personal information under the instructions of, and solely for, Qualitative.io or to which Qualitative.io discloses personal information for use on Qualitative.io's behalf.</p>\n                <p>\"Personal information\" means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Qualitative.io to identify (together with other information) a living individual.

You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties' collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance.\n                Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings.\n                Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.\n                Collection, Use, And Disclosure Of Participants' Information Through Our Services\n                This section describes our policies for handling information about Participants provided to us by our clients using our Services or other sources of their choosing. We provide our clients with the ability to create profiles of their Participants in order to conduct research with them, and the ability to export information, at our client's direction, to other applications. To do this, our clients integrate our technology into their applications, websites, or other online services.\n                Our clients' collection, use, and disclosure of data is separately governed by their privacy policies. Our clients may collect information about their users directly; in that case, each of our clients is responsible for ensuring that their data collection follows their privacy policies and terms of use.\n                Collection\n                In the course of providing Services to our clients, Qualitative.io collects personally identifiable information (\"PII\") about Participants of our clients. Qualitative.io uses this information to provide our Services to our clients.\n                PII is information that is linked or linkable to you. The PII we collect may include name, phone number, or email address, which you may have provided to our client. Qualitative.io takes precautions not to collect, and, if discovered, will not retain passwords, credit card details, and certain other information submitted through our services.\n                We may automatically collect information about your use, navigation of, and interactions with our clients' applications, websites, or other online services when our client has installed our technology on its properties.\n                Qualitative.io retains standard web log data 5 years after you visit a client's website, and aggregations and reports for up to 10 years after you visit a client's website.\n                Use And Disclosure\n                We collect information about Participants at our clients' direction. We do this to provide our Services, which enable our clients to optimize their communications with, and understanding of, their Participants. We consider our clients' Participants' information to be confidential to that client. Accordingly, we do not disclose Participant information to unaffiliated third parties except in response to our clients' explicit instructions, as provided for in an agreement between us and our client, or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy (for example, as necessary to respond to legal requirements).\n                Qualitative.io may provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. We may share Participant information collected from our clients that is related to such transactions with those affiliated businesses. We require our affiliates, via contract, to provide the same level of privacy protection as set forth in this policy and they do not have the right to share or use PII for any purpose other than for an authorized transaction.\n                If we ever were to engage in any onward transfers of your data with third parties for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized, we would provide you with an opt-out choice to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data.\n                Collection, Use, And Disclosure Of Information From Our Clients\n                This section describes our policies for our clients' use of the Qualitative.io Site and Services.\n                Information Clients Provide To Us \n                We receive and store any information clients enter on the Site, through the Services, or provide to us in any other way. Clients can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then they may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use clients' PII for such purposes as responding to their requests for Services, customizing the content they see, communicating with them about our products, and marketing our Services to them.\n                In order for clients to use all of our features, they must register with Qualitative.io. We require clients' e-mail credentials during the registration process.\n                Further information may be required if clients choose to purchase paid components of the Services, such as credit card and billing information. Qualitative.io uses third party partners for credit card processing who may require and store your credit card and billing information.\n                E-Mail Communications\n                If a client purchases Qualitative.io's online tools to recruit participants and conduct research, Qualitative.io will communicate with it about the services it purchases by e-mail. Clients consent to receiving such confirmations by e-mail. If clients contact us via e-mail, we may retain a record of their contact information and any information they provide us in their messages to respond to them. We may receive a confirmation when clients open an e-mail from Qualitative.io.\n                We may also send e-mails with news or promotions. If clients do not want to receive news or promotional e-mail from us, please contact us at privacy@qualitative.io (this will not affect e-mails related to certain important, legal, or service-related messages such as outage information).\n                Information From Other Sources\n                To improve our Services, we may receive information about clients from other sources and add it to our account information. Like the information clients provide to us, we do not share this information with anyone except authorized third parties in connection with providing clients with our Services.\n                We do not disclose clients' information to unaffiliated third parties without clients' consent, or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy (for example, as necessary to respond to legal requirements).\n                Other Important Information\n                Your California Privacy Rights\n                If you are a California resident, California law permits you to request certain information regarding the disclosure of your PII by us and our related companies to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send your request, by mail or email, to the addresses listed at the end of this policy.\n                Agents\n                We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share client and Participant information with them to provide products and services. Examples include billing, processing payments, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. Our agents use the same level of privacy protection as we do. Unless we tell you differently, Qualitative.io does not share, and Qualitative.io's agents do not have any right to use, PII collected from our Site and Services beyond what is necessary to assist us.\n                Business Transfers\n                In some cases, we may change our ownership or corporate organization, or may choose to buy or sell assets. Participant information may be transferred to another entity, its affiliates, or service providers in connection with the transaction. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that Qualitative.io or its successor organization may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy.\n                Protection Of Qualitative.io And Others\n                We may release PII when we in our sole discretion believe in good faith that release is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Qualitative.io, our employees, our clients, or others. We also may be required to disclose an individual's PII in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n                Information Security\n                Clients' Qualitative.io account information is protected by an OAuth token for your privacy and security as well as other reasonable security measures. We use reasonable safeguards to protect the security of clients' information during transmission, including by encrypting all of the information clients input. Only employees or agents who need PII to perform a specific job are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.\n                While Qualitative.io uses commercially reasonable means to secure information provided to us, we do not guarantee that such information will not be improperly accessed, disclosed, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. Clients and Participants are responsible for the security of their information that is transmitted to us or that is viewed, downloaded, or otherwise accessed when using unencrypted, public or otherwise unsecured networks. \n                Accessing Information \n                You are able to access, add to, update, correct, amend, or delete certain information about you, including PII. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. A client may deactivate its Qualitative.io account by following the deactivation process set forth on the Site. Some information may remain in our records after account deletion. Please contact us at privacy@qualitative.io if you have questions or concerns about accessing, correcting, or deleting your PII.\n                EU and Swiss data subjects have a right to access their information. Please see the EU-U.S. Data Privacy and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks section below.\n                Conditions Of Use\n                Your use of the Site and Services and any possible dispute over privacy are subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including limitations on damages, dispute resolution, and application of New York state law.\n                International Users (Except For EU And Swiss Data Subjects)\n                If you use our Websites outside of the United States, you understand and consent to the transfer of your personal information to, and the collection, processing, and storage of your personal information in, the United States and elsewhere. The laws in the U.S. and these countries regarding personal information may be different than the laws of your state or country.\n                Use Of Qualitative.io's Site By Children\n                Qualitative.io's Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we will not knowingly collect or use any PII from children that we know to be under the age of 18. If we become aware of PII in our database that was collected from a child under 18, we will delete such information. \n                Changes To This Privacy Policy\n                Qualitative.io may amend this Privacy Policy. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make material changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by sending you an email thirty (30) days before the changes take effect and by posting a notice on client dashboards on the Site.\n                EU-U.S. Data Privacy and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks\n                Definitions\n                For purposes of this section only, the following definitions shall apply:\n                \"Agent\" means any third party that collects or uses personal information under the instructions of, and solely for, Qualitative.io or to which Qualitative.io discloses personal information for use on Qualitative.io's behalf.\n                \"Personal information\" means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Qualitative.io to identify (together with other information) a living individual.
