Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.</p>

	<br><li><strong>How do we collect your personal information?</strong>
	<p>The personal information is collected in many ways and may include:</p>

	<ul><li><strong>Personal information you provide to us.</strong> Most of the personal information we receive comes to us voluntarily from our users in the course of using our Services, communicating with us in the procurement of or in the process of requesting our Services, registering to attend a seminar or participate in a survey, interacting with us at trade shows or conventions or other industry events or asking to be included in an email or other communication list, or other product promotions.

		<p>You are free to choose which personal information you want to provide to us or whether you want to provide us with any personal information at all. However, some personal information, such as your name, address, payment information and information on your requested Services may be necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations. Without providing this personal information, you will not be able to order certain Services or enter into a contract with us.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Personal information collected via technology.</strong> As you use our Services, we may collect information automatically, such as log information and through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies. Please see our section “<a href="#cookies" data-flexera-link-initialized="true" class="link--hash">How do we use cookies and other Tracking Technology</a>?” below for more information.</li>
		<li><strong>Personal information we receive from others.</strong> We may receive personal information about users from publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, third parties such as social media sites, law enforcement agencies, providers of denied party screening and marketing consultants and partners. We may also receive personal information, such as contact details, including name, position, phone or email address from our partners and customers.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<br><li><strong>Why we collect and use your personal information?</strong>
	<p>The reasons for using your personal information may differ depending on the purpose of the collection. Regularly, we use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>

	<ul><li><strong>Providing our Services</strong>. If you order Services from Flexera or if you contact us to request our Services, we use your personal information to provide you with these Services.</li>
		<li><strong>Pursue our business interests.</strong> The usage of your personal information may also be necessary for our own business interests. For example, we may use some of your personal information to evaluate and review our business performance, create financial statements, improve our Services, provide advertising or to identify potential cyber security threats. We may use your personal information for marketing purposes, for example, to send you relevant product updates and/or share your contact information such as name, email address or phone number with reseller partners for them to directly contact, qualify and manage the customer relationship. In the case that a reseller partner uses your contact details for own marketing purposes, we or the reseller will do so only if you have granted a respective separate consent. If necessary, we may also use your personal information to pursue or defend ourselves against legal claims.</li>
		<li><strong>Purpose for which consent has been provided.</strong> In some cases, we may ask you to grant us separate consent to use your personal information.
		<p>We often work on the basis of consent in relation to sales and marketing campaigns. For example, if you sign up to our email newsletter, you allow us to send marketing communication to you, or when our marketing partners provide us with your email address, we will process your data to the extent covered by your consent. If you want to learn about your options regarding withdrawing your consent to receive marketing communication, please see our section “<a href="#preferences" data-flexera-link-initialized="true" class="link--hash">E-Mail Settings and Preferences</a>.” If you want to learn more about your options to avoid Tracking Technology, please see our section “<a href="#cookies" data-flexera-link-initialized="true" class="link--hash">How do we use cookies and other Tracking Technology</a>?”.</p>

		<p>If you have granted us consent to use your information, we will use it only for the purposes for which you have granted your consent. You are free to deny your consent and the denial will have no negative consequences for you. You are also free to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Comply with legal obligations. </strong>We are obligated to retain certain information because of legal requirements, for example, tax or commercial laws, or we may be required by law enforcement to provide personal information on request.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<br><li><strong>With whom do we share your personal information?</strong>
	<p>As required in accordance with how we use it, we will share your personal information with the following third parties:</p>

	<ul><li><strong>Flexera group companies.</strong> To support our sales and marketing efforts, as well as in the performance of the Services, your personal information may be disclosed to Flexera group companies. Further information regarding the Flexera group companies can be obtained <a href="/about-us" data-flexera-link-initialized="true">here</a>.</li>
		<li><strong>Service providers and advisors.</strong> We may use third party vendors and other service providers to perform services on our behalf. Such services may include marketing campaign services, providing mailing or email services, tax and accounting services, product fulfilment, payment processing, conducting surveys or contests, performing customer service, performing data enhancement services, performing fraud prevention services, performing web hosting services or providing analytic services.

	<br><li><strong>How do we use cookies and other Tracking Technology?</strong>
	<p>When using our Services, we and our third-party partners may automatically collect certain types of usage information. For this purpose, we often rely on tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts and similar technology (collectively, “<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>”) in accordance with this notice. Where legally required, we will inform you about the use of such tracking technologies using so-called cookie-banners and/or obtain your consent to use such Tracking Technology.</p>

	<ul><li><strong>How do these Tracking Technologies work?</strong> Cookies are pieces of code that allow for personalization of the Services experience by saving your personal information such as user ID and other preferences. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device's hard disk (such as your computer or smartphone) for record-keeping purposes. Cookies store certain settings and data for exchange with our system via your browser. A cookie usually contains the name of the domain from which the cookie has been placed, as well as information about the age of the cookie and a random alphanumeric identifier, the so-called cookie-ID. They help to recognize the device and make any pre-settings immediately available. Web beacons are small graphical images that may be included on our Sites and typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behaviour. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. Flash cookies are pieces of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user's computer or device. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity often use flash cookies.</li>
		<li><strong>What information do these Tracking Technologies collect?</strong> These tracking technologies collect information about your browser and online usage patterns (e.g., IP address, pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Services such as opening an email, log files, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, etc.), and information about the device(s) you use to access the Services (e.g., unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (IDFA), Google AdID or Windows Advertising ID), device type, model and manufacturer, operating system brand and model and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data). We, or our third party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising and content displayed on another device so that we may recognize and contact you on the various devices you may use.</li>
		<li><strong>What are Cookies and other Tracking Technologies used for?</strong> Tracking Technologies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how our Websites are being used, helping us analyse trends, administering the Websites, tracking users’ movements around the Websites, gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience. Tracking Technology can also help ensure that you see marketing content that is more relevant to you and your interests. Therefore, generally speaking, we use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website(s); (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c)&nbsp;recognize and contact you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage and demographic patterns on our Websites; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise plan for and enhance our Services.</li>
		<li><strong>What types of cookies are used by Flexera?</strong> The types of cookies used on our site can generally be put into one of the following categories: Necessary; functional and advertising. You can find out more about each of the cookie categories in the table below.
		<ul><li><strong>Necessary Cookies.</strong> These cookies are essential to make our Websites work. They enable you to move around the Websites and use their features. Without these cookies, services that are <strong>necessary</strong> for you to fully use our Websites may not be available, such as accessing certain areas of the Websites.</li>
			<li><strong>Functional Cookies.</strong> These cookies allow us to recognize you and tailor our Websites to provide enhanced features and content to you. For example, these cookies can be used to remember your IP address, language choice, country selection and requested Services.</li>
			<li><strong>Advertising Cookies.</strong> These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and may track you on other websites. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertising partners.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><strong>How long will cookies stay on your browsing device?</strong> The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing the website that has set the cookie. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device after you have finished browsing a particular website, until they are deleted or until they expire. The actual period of validity of each persistent cookie depends on each cookie. However, they generally expire within 3 months. You can amend your cookie settings using your internet browser’s settings.</li>
		<li><strong>Cookies by third parties.</strong> Some cookies belong to us, and we place them on your device. Other cookies are placed on your browsing device by third parties when you visit our Websites. Third parties setting cookies from our Websites will be providing a service to us or a function of the website, but we do not always control how third-party cookies are used. Some third parties may use advertising cookies to help gather information about your browsing activity so that they can deliver website advertising to you that is relevant to your interests. You should check the third party's website for more information about how they use cookies. The third-party tracking technologies on our Websites include Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Test &amp; Target, Google AdWords, Twitter Advertising, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions, Eloqua, Facebook Customer Audience, Google Analytics, LinkedIn Analytics, Visual Website Optimizer, Kenshoo and Demandbase. You can, for example, also download the <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/" data-flexera-link-initialized="true">Ghostery</a> browser extension to find out the most current tracking technologies running on our Websites.</li>
		<li><strong>Interest-based advertising.</strong> We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your online browsing history and your interests. To do this, we or our advertising partners may collect information about how you use or connect to our Services, or the types of other websites, social media services, content and ads that you (or others using your device) visit or view or connect to our Services. Typically, this information is collected through cookies and similar tracking technologies. Where legally required, we will obtain your consent.
		<p>If you only want to limit third-party advertising cookies, you can turn such cookies off by visiting the following links (please bear in mind that there are many more companies listed on these sites than those that drop cookies via our website):</p>

		</li>
		<li><strong>How can you manage cookies from our Websites?</strong> The cookies we use are designed to help you get the most from our Services, but if you do not wish to receive cookies, most browsers allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. You can also avoid Tracking Technology by not consenting to the use of Tracking Technology when asked for consent in cookie banners. Please check your browser and browser settings to determine where cookies are stored and whether and how they may be deleted. The help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable most cookies altogether. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all Tracking Technologies. Please note that in the case you delete existing cookies, your chosen pre-settings will be deleted as well. This means that the next time you access our website, we may ask for your consent again (to the extent required by law) and set new cookies. The period of validity of those cookies will then start from the beginning. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the "Help" option in your browser for more details.

	<p>Flexera acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Flexera has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes on behalf of its customers. An individual who seeks access or who seeks to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to Flexera’s customer (the data controller).

Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.</p>

We may use your personal information for marketing purposes, for example, to send you relevant product updates and/or share your contact information such as name, email address or phone number with reseller partners for them to directly contact, qualify and manage the customer relationship. To the extent we rely on legitimate interests to process your data for marketing purposes (for example, in the case that you have provided your email address in connection with the purchase of our services), you may object to such processing at any time via <a href="https://info.flexera.com/Manage-Preferences?lead_source=Website%20Visitor&amp;id=Flexera.com-Legal" data-flexera-link-initialized="true">https://info.flexera.com/Manage-Preferences</a> or by using the link provided to you at the end of each promotional communication.

</ol><h4>C. Additional California-specific disclosures</h4>

<ol start="25"><li><strong>Scope of notice.</strong>

	<p>These Additional California specific disclosures (the “<strong>CA Notice</strong>”) supplements the information contained in the privacy notice above and applies solely to individual residents of the State of California (“<strong>consumers</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”).</p>

	<p>This CA Notice provides additional information about how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information of individual residents of the State of California, either online or offline, within the scope of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”).</p>

	<p>Unless otherwise expressly stated, all terms in this CA Notice have the same meaning as defined in our privacy notice above or as otherwise defined in the CCPA.</p>
	</li>
	<br><li><strong>General remarks on personal information disclosures.</strong>
	<p>When we use the term “<strong>personal information</strong>” in this CA Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.</p>

	<p>For the purposes of this CA Notice, the term personal information does not include:</p>

	<ul><li>Publicly available information from government records.</li>
		<li>De-identified or aggregated information that is maintained in a form that is not capable of being associated with or linked to you.</li>
		<li>Information excluded from the CCPA's scope, such as:
		<ul><li>Information reflecting a communication or a transaction between us and a representative of another legal entity in the context of conducting due diligence regarding, or providing or receiving, a product or service to or from that legal entity.</li>
			<li>Information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FRCA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Information relating to our job applicants, employees, contractors and other personnel.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<br><li><strong>Information on data processing rendered by us on behalf of customers.</strong>
	<p>Where a Flexera group company processes personal information based on a data processing agreement entered with you or your employer (or other similarly situated entity), the respective Flexera group company is not the “business” that determines the purposes and means of the processing of consumers’ personal information, but a “service provider” within the meaning of the CCPA.</p>

	<p>The use of personal information provided to us as a service provider by our customers for the purpose of processing on their behalf shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Service for which the customer has engaged Flexera (data processing on behalf of customer).</p>

	<p>Flexera acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Flexera has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes on behalf of its customers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to Flexera’s customer (the business). If requested by our customer to remove data we are processing on their behalf and at their direction, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.</p>
	</li>
	<br><li><strong>Collection and use of personal information.</strong>
	<p>In the last 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information from the following sources of personal information for the following purposes, which reference the personal information, sources and purposes described in the “<a href="#what_we_collect" data-flexera-link-initialized="true" class="link--hash">What personal information do we collect?</a>” and “<a href="#how_we_collect" data-flexera-link-initialized="true" class="link--hash">How do we collect your information</a>” section of our privacy notice:</p>

	<p>As described in the “<a href="#whom_we_share" data-flexera-link-initialized="true" class="link--hash">With whom do we share your personal information?</a>” section in our privacy notice, we have disclosed personal information within Flexera and with a variety of third parties for business purposes.</p>

	<ul><li>All of the categories of personal information we collect, explained in the table above.</li>
	</ul><p><strong>*Note about “Sales”:</strong> Flexera does not “sell” personal information as most people would typically understand that term. However, we do allow certain third-party advertising partners to collect information about consumers through our Services for purposes of serving ads that are more relevant, for ad campaign measurement and analytics and for ad fraud detection and reporting. To the extent these practices qualify as “sales” under the CCPA, you may have the right to opt out as described in the “<a href="#CA" data-flexera-link-initialized="true" class="link--hash">California-specific rights</a>” section below.</p>
	</li>

	</ul></li>
	<br><li><strong>How to exercise your California-specific rights.</strong>
	<ul><li><strong>To exercise your right to know or right to deletion. </strong>To exercise your right to know and/or right to deletion, please submit a request by:
		<ul><li>Emailing <a href="mailto:DataProtectionTeam@Flexera.com" data-flexera-link-initialized="true">DataProtectionTeam@Flexera.com</a> with the subject line “California Rights Request,”; or</li>
			<li>Filling out our California Resident Rights Request Form.</li>
		</ul><p>Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm you are a resident of the State of California. In order to verify your identity, we will generally require you to (1) log into your account if you have one, or (2) require you to provide sufficient information to enable us to identify the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional personal information from you, including, but not limited to your name, email, address, and/or date of last interaction with customer service. We will only use personal information provided in connection with a Consumer Rights Request to review and comply with the request.</p>

		<p>In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your personal information in our systems. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request.</p>

		<p><strong>Authorized Agents</strong></p>

		<p>In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent (as that term is defined by the CCPA) to submit requests on your behalf through the designated methods set forth in this CA Notice where we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf by:</p>

		</ul></li>
		<li><strong>To exercise your right to opt out of personal information sales</strong>
		<p>As noted above, we do not “sell” personal information as most people would typically understand that term. However, as is common practice among companies that operate online, we permit third party advertising networks, social media companies and other third party businesses to collect and disclose your personal information (including Internet/Network Information, Commercial Information, and Inferences) directly from your browser or device through cookies or tracking technologies when you visit or interact with our websites or engage with us online. These third parties use this information for the purposes of serving ads that are more relevant, for ad campaign measurement and analytics, and for fraud detection and reporting and they may sell that information to other businesses for advertising and other purposes. By visiting <a href="https://www.privacyrights.info/" data-flexera-link-initialized="true">www.privacyrights.info</a> or <a href="https://optout.privacyrights.info/?c=1" data-flexera-link-initialized="true">https://optout.privacyrights.info/</a>, you can opt out from sales of this type of personal information by businesses that participate in the opt out tool. To make opt-out requests related to mobile apps on your device for businesses participating in the DAA’s CCPA App-based Opt-Out Tool, you can download the appropriate app at www.youradchoices.com/appchoices. To learn more about how third parties collect information automatically and the choices you may have in relation to those activities, please see “<a href="#cookies" data-flexera-link-initialized="true" class="link--hash">How can you manage cookies from our Websites?</a>” and “<strong>Interest-based advertising</strong>” in the “<a href="#cookies" data-flexera-link-initialized="true" class="link--hash">How do we use cookies and other Tracking Technology?</a>” section of our privacy notice.</p>
		</li>
	</ul></li>
	<br><li><strong>Minors under age 16.</strong>
	<p>We do not sell the personal information of consumers we know to be less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "Right to Opt In") from either the minor who is between 13 and 16 years of age or the parent or guardian of a minor less than 13 years of age.
