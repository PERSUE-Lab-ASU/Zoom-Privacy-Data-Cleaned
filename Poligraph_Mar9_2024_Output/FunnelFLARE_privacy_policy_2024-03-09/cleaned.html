FunnelFLARE is committed to respecting your privacy rights when visiting any FunnelFLARE webpage, such as this one. To protect your Personal Information, FunnelFLARE required all subscribers of FunnelFLARE services to following the guidelines outlined below. Understanding that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, any changes to this policy will be promptly posted on this page.</p> <p><strong>Information Collected</strong><br>While visiting any FunnelFLARE hosted webpage, we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the FunnelFLARE subscriber. Such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, street address, and e-mail address. On any page that collects Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service, register you for an event or training, enter you in the promotion you have requested, or respond to your inquiry or comment.</p> <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>A cookie is a small data text file that a web site sends to your browser, which is stored on your system. The Site can only access the information from a cookie sent by the Site. We cannot access cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein. Additionally, we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information about you through the use of a cookie. The only way we would learn such information is if you specifically and voluntarily submit that information to us, for example, through a registration system, or by entering a sweepstakes or promotion.</p> <p>We could use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are sent by third parties (e.g. advertising agencies or advertising clients). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. We encourage you to contact the advertiser or its privacy policy for more information on these cookies. Links from other Web sites that appear on the Site may also send cookies; but we do not control such activities.</p> <p>FunnelFLARE uses cookies to track usage of the Site and further personalize your experience when you are visiting the Site. By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the Site best serve the users.</p> <p>Overall, the use of cookies helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Site. The information is used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies also identify you to our server, allowing you to avoid retyping your e-mail address and password each time you access the Site. You may decline to accept cookies sent by the Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, portions of the Site which require registration will not be accessible to you. In such cases, we ask that you register and provide us with basic information on our registration page, or sign in if previously registered. Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you access our Site.</p> <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>FunnelFLARE logs IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and to determine site usage. Your IP address does not contain personal information about you.</p> <p>Use of Personal Information<br>We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share Personal Information with third parties outside of FunnelFLARE, except as described in this Privacy Policy. Because FunnelFLARE is a subscription based servers, subscribers only have access to the Personal Information assocaited with their specific account. No personal information is ever shared across accounts. We believe we can enhance your experience on our Site with the information you share with us. We use Personal Information about you to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the Site’s content, layout, and services. We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we have collected, or respond to your comments and suggestions.</p> <p>FunnelFLARE may match specific and/or aggregated Personal Information with third party data to provide you with product and content offerings that interest you and improve our advertising and marketing efforts. FunnelFLARE also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, and for other lawful purposes.</p> <p>As part of your experience on our Site, you may receive communications from us related to products and services that might interest you.

When you sign up for a service we offer on the Site, we may be required to share Personal Information with that service provider in order to provide the service. These third party providers are required to comply with this policy and protect your information in the same way we do. They are not permitted to retain or use Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to providing the service.</p> <p>FunnelFLARE may also offer other services as a part of our Site. If you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some of your Personal Information to these parties. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Site. Some of these third parties may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing the service. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy for that portion of the Site prior to disclosing Personal Information.

In addition, other sites may use the Site’s or FunnelFLARE’s name. Since FunnelFLARE does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of such third parties, and JumpDEMAND shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information by such parties. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties’ privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others.</p> <p><strong>Links to Other Materials</strong><br>Third party sites linked to and from the Site are not necessarily under the control of FunnelFLARE.

You may choose to "opt-out" of sharing Personal Information in several ways. When choosing to use certain features or services on the Site, you can choose whether to share optional Personal Information in connection with the feature or service.
