This notice explains to you how Sellular manages and protects your personal data when you use our application or visit our website.</p><p>We want to make sure that you fully understand what personal data we need from you in order to serve you better, how we use and protect your personal data and why we need your personal data when you are interacting with us.

Personal data refers to any information related to someone that can be identified through it either directly or indirectly. This means that, in some cases, a single element of information may not identify you but several pieced together will and, if they do, then they are considered personal data. Examples of personal data include your name, identification numbers, location, factors specific to your physical, mental, economic or social identity, among others.</p><h4>What personal data protection and privacy regulations does Sellular need to comply with?</h4><p>Because we are a global organization, we need to comply with different data protection and privacy regulations around the world such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) among others.

We respect your privacy rights at all times.</p><h4>Sellular is a data controller and a data processor.</h4><p>Some data protection regulations differentiate between a data controller and a data processor. A data controller is an organization that determines how to collect and process personal data whereas a data processor is an organization that collects and processes personal data on the data controller’s behalf and under the data controller’s instructions.</p><p>As a controller, Sellular collects and processes personal data from visitors to the Sellular’s website and from customers that sign up for our services. In this context, Sellular determines how this personal data is collected, processed and shared.</p><p>As a data processor, Sellular collects and processes personal data from registered customers’ users and only does so as per customers’ requirements.
