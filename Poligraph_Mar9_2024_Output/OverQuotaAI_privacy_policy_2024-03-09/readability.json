As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</span><br></p><p><span><strong>Consent.</strong></span><span> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose.

For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</span></p><ul><li><span>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</span></li><li><span>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</span></li><li><span>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</span></li><li><span>Support our marketing activities</span></li><li><span>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</span></li><li><span>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</span><br></li></ul><p><span><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong></span><span> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</span><br></p><p><span><strong>Vital Interests.</strong></span><span> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</span><br></p><p><span><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></span></p><p><span>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. </span><br></p><p><span>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</span></p><ul><li><span>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</span></li><li><span>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</span></li><li><span>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</span></li><li><span>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</span></li><li><span>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</span></li><li><span>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</span></li><li><span>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</span></li><li><span>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</span></li><li><span>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</span></li><li><span>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</span></li><li><span>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</span></li></ul><p><span><strong>Appendix B</strong></span><br></p><p><span><strong>Mode and place of processing the Data</strong></span><br></p><p><span><strong>Methods of processing</strong></span></p><p><span>OverQuota implements appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of Data. Data processing is performed using computer systems and/or IT tools following established procedures that are strictly related to the stated purposes. In addition to OverQuota, certain individuals involved in the operation of the company, such as administrators, sales and marketing personnel, legal representatives, and system administrators, may have access to the Data in some cases. OverQuota may also appoint third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, or communications agencies as Data Processors if necessary. An updated list of these parties can be obtained by contacting OverQuota at any time.</span><br></p><p><span><strong>Legal basis of processing</strong></span></p><p><span>OverQuota may process Personal Information about Users if one of the following conditions are met: User's consent has been given for a specific purpose, however, in some legislations, OverQuota may be allowed to process Personal Information until the User objects to such processing (\"opt-out\"). This does not apply in situations where processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection law. Personal Information is needed to perform an agreement with the User or to fulfill precontractual obligations. Processing is required to comply with a legal obligation that OverQuota is subject to. Processing is related to a task carried out in the public interest or as a result of official authority vested in OverQuota. Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of OverQuota or a third party. OverQuota will assist in determining the specific legal basis that applies to the processing and if the provision of Personal Information is required by law, contract, or necessary to enter into a contract.</span><br></p><p><span><strong>Place</strong></span></p><p><span>The processing of Data occurs at OverQuota's headquarters and wherever the parties involved in processing may be located. Data transfer to a country other than the User's may occur based on the User's location. The User can find information about the place of Data processing and the legal basis for transferring Data to a different country in the section detailing the processing of Personal Data. Additionally, the User can learn about the security measures taken by OverQuota to protect their Data and the specifics of any data transfer outside the European Union or to international organizations. For further information, the User can refer to relevant sections of this document or reach out to OverQuota through the contact information provided</span><br></p><p><span><strong>Retention time</strong></span></p><p><span>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for. Therefore: Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between OverQuota and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed. Personal Data collected for the purposes of OverQuota\u2019s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by OverQuota within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting OverQuota.</span><br></p><p><span>OverQuota may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, OverQuota may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority. Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</span><br></p><p><span><strong>The purposes of processing</strong></span></p><p><span>The information collected from users is used by OverQuota to provide its services, meet its legal obligations, respond to requests from law enforcement, protect its rights and interests, and detect any harmful or fraudulent activities. The data is used for the following purposes: analytics, infrastructure monitoring, tag management, hosting and backend infrastructure, managing contacts, managing user databases, handling payments, and managing support and contact requests. For more detailed information about the personal data used for each purpose, refer to the section \"Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data\".</span><br></p><p><span><strong>Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data</strong></span></p><p><span>Personal Data is collected for the following purposes and using the following services:</span><br></p><p><span><strong>Analytics</strong></span></p><p><span>The services contained in this section enable OverQuota to monitor and analyze web traffic and can be used to keep track of User behavior.</span><br></p><p><span><strong>Google Analytics (Google LLC)</strong></span></p><p><span>Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google LLC (\"Google\"). Google uses the information gathered to monitor and assess the utilization of OverQuota, create reports on its activities, and share these reports with other Google services. Additionally, Google may also use the collected data to personalize and contextualize the ads in its advertising network.</span><br></p><p><span><strong>Handling payments</strong></span></p><p><span>OverQuota uses external payment service providers to process credit card payments, unless otherwise indicated. Typically, users are required to directly provide their payment information and personal details to these payment service providers, not OverQuota. OverQuota only receives notification of successful payment from the payment service provider, and is not involved in the collection or processing of such information.
