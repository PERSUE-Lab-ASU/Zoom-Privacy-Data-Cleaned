(\"OverQuota,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us\") regarding the collection, usage, and disclosure of information from users of the OverQuota website (https://www.overquota.ai, https://app.overquota.ai) and the Services, including the application \"OverQuota.\" The information we receive about you can come from various sources, such as your user account on the Services (when you register), your general use of the Services, and third-party websites and services. By using the Services, you are giving your consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other usage of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use the Services. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at info@overquota.ai. This Privacy Policy Covers: This Privacy Policy governs how we handle personally identifiable information (\"Personal Information\") collected when you use or access our Services. It also applies to the treatment of Personal Information that our business partners may share with us or that we may share with them. These business partners include brands offering their own products and services through our Services. This Privacy Policy is not applicable to the practices of companies or entities that we do not own or control. This includes, but is not limited to, any of our business partners or websites, services, and applications provided by third parties that you access through the Services. Although we try to provide access only to those third-party services that respect your privacy, we have no control over, do not monitor, and cannot take responsibility for these third-party services, their content, or their privacy policies. We advise you to carefully review the privacy policies of any third-party services you choose to access. The Information We Collect and How That Information is Used: The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. In Short: We collect personal information that you provide to us. OverQuota may collect personal information such as names, email addresses, job titles, usernames, passwords, and contact information. This information may be obtained through services you connect to OverQuota. If you connect OverQuota to third-parties, we will request access to certain data on your behalf. Audio recordings will be collected through the OverQuota service, and users are required to obtain consent before sharing personal information. Registered users can access and edit their information by logging into the Services. Personal Information Provided by You. The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. Account Information: By creating an account on the Services and providing personal information, such as your username, password, and email address, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may no longer be anonymous. This information may be considered personal to you. We may use your contact information to send you messages about our Services and may continue to send you non-marketing emails, such as those related to your account and our business dealings with you, even if you unsubscribe from marketing emails by clicking the link at the bottom of the emails. The Services allow users to sign in and create an account by using their identification and login credentials from accounts like Google, Outlook, Salesforce, Hubspot, Zoom, etc. (each referred to as a \"Third Party Account\"). By logging in through a Third Party Account, you grant the Services access to your information and you agree to the terms of use of the Third Party Account while using the Services. We may receive information from these Third Party Accounts, which may then be imported into the Services (either as part of your profile or otherwise). The way we use information from a Third Party Account is based on the policies and privacy settings selected through the Third Party Account, so it's important to review those policies and settings. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of your Third Party Account and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of each Third Party Account. We will not be liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of your Third Party Account; (ii) the content, products or services on or available on your Third Party Account or (iii) your use of your Third Party Account. Information you provide to us: When you use the Services, you may provide us with your audio recordings (\"Audio Recordings\") and any text, images or videos that you upload or provide to us in the context of the Services. We also collect information that you include in your profile, such as your photo and name. Information you provide us about others: If you choose to collaborate with others, or refer us to them, you provide us with the email address and contact information of your co-workers or friends. If you provide an Audio Recording, this may contain the Personal Information of third parties. Before you do so, please make sure you have the necessary permissions before sharing Personal Information or referring them to us. Information Collected from Other Sources: We may obtain your information through services that you connect to OverQuota. By giving us access to your third-party account credentials, you agree that some information from those accounts (referred to as \"Third Party Account Information\") will be transmitted to your OverQuota account and that the privacy policy applies to this Third Party Account Information. Our products may also ask for permission to perform actions on your behalf using your third-party account credentials. For instance, if you connect OverQuota products to your Zoom or Google account, OverQuota will request the right to access certain data on your behalf. Financial Information: We do not collect financial information. However, we receive transaction information from our payment processor Square. Other Information: If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional personal information. We also collect other types of personal information that you provide to us voluntarily. If you participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion, we will collect any data you provide in connection with that promotion. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Services. We may also collect personal information at other points in our Services that state that personal information is being collected. IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically: When you use our Services, certain information is automatically collected, such as the type of device you use, your device's unique identifier, the date/time of your visit, your browser type, operating system, IP address, domain name, amongst other information. This information helps us deliver relevant information and improve our Services. In case our Application crashes, we may receive information about your software version to identify and fix bugs. We also store log files including IP addresses, browser type, ISP, operating system, and clickstream data to improve the content and tailor our Services to your needs. We use third-party analytics services that use Cookies to collect information such as how often you use the Services. The information collected by these services is subject to their terms of use and privacy policy.

OverQuota will assist in determining the specific legal basis that applies to the processing and if the provision of Personal Information is required by law, contract, or necessary to enter into a contract.

Furthermore, OverQuota may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority. Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
