It is the entity alone that decides the purposes and means of processing personal data within\n            the framework of the contract they enter into, and it is also the entity alone that is responsible for\n            complying with all obligations from the GDPR, including providing information about the principles of\n            personal data processing.

In addition, Anonymous Information is used for analytical and statistical as well as marketing\n            purposes (e.g. creating Custom Audiences on Facebook, setting, targeting and directing advertisements).\n          </p> <p>\n            Anonymous Information is also processed by tool providers under the terms of their Terms of Conditions and\n            Privacy Policies. It may be used by these providers to provide, improve and manage services, develop new\n            services, measure the effectiveness of advertisements, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalise\n            the content and advertisements displayed on individual services, websites, and applications.

For details on the\n            tools of external providers, please see the section on the tools we use.\n          </p> <p>\n            Additionally, in exceptional cases, we may also obtain your personal data from other sources, e.g. when\n            the entity that employs you indicates your data to us as a contact person for contractual matters, or when\n            you represent an entity that enters into a contract with us.\n          </p></div> <div id=\"7\"><h2>#7: Are your data secure?</h2> <p>\n            We do care about the security of your personal data. We have analyzed the risks associated with the\n            various data processing processes and then implemented appropriate security and data protection measures.\n            We constantly monitor the state of our technical infrastructure, train our staff, observe the procedures\n            applied, and make necessary improvements.\n          </p></div> <div id=\"8\"><h2>#8: How long will we store your personal data?</h2> <p>\n            We process your personal data for as long as it is justified within the framework of a given purpose for\n            processing your personal data, and therefore processing periods vary depending on the purpose. Please note\n            that the termination of the processing of your data for one purpose does not necessarily lead to the\n            complete erasure or destruction of your personal data since the same set of data may be processed for\n            another purpose, for the period of time indicated for that purpose. Complete erasure or destruction of\n            data occurs when all purposes have been completed and in other cases indicated in the GDPR.\n          </p> <p>\n            Below you will find a description of the processing periods:\n          </p> <ul><li><b>User account</b> \u2013 data related to the user account are processed for the duration of the user\n              account;\n            </li> <li><b>Conclusion and handling of the contract</b> \u2013 contract-related data are processed for the time\n              necessary to conclude and perform the contract;\n            </li> <li><b>Complaints and withdrawals</b> \u2013 data related to complaints and withdrawals are processed for the\n              time necessary to handle the complaint or withdrawal;\n            </li> <li><b>Contact and correspondence</b> \u2013 data related to correspondence handling will be processed for the\n              duration of the contact between us;\n            </li> <li><b>Tax and accounting obligations</b> \u2013 data related to the fulfilment of tax and accounting obligations\n              will be processed for the time prescribed by tax law, usually 5 years after the end of the tax year;\n            </li> <li><b>Archive</b> \u2013 data related to the archive will be processed until the information contained in the\n              archive is no longer relevant;\n            </li> <li><b>Defence against claims, establishment of claims, and redress</b> \u2013 data related to claims will be\n              processed until the claims are time-barred, and the period of limitation for claims may vary in light of\n              the applicable legislation (e.g. for businesses the standard period is 3 years);\n            </li> <li><b>Social media</b> \u2013 data related to social media audience will be processed until you opt out of\n              interacting with us on social media;\n            </li> <li><b>Analysis and statistics</b> \u2013 data related to analytics and statistics will be processed until they\n              are no longer useful or until you effectively object;\n            </li> <li><b>Own marketing</b> \u2013 data related to own marketing will be processed until they become obsolete or\n              until you effectively object;\n            </li> <li><b>Ancillary tools</b> \u2013 data related to ancillary tools will be processed until they are no longer\n              useful or you effectively object;\n            </li> <li><b>Data protection obligations</b> \u2013 data related to the protection of personal data will be processed\n              until the expiry of their relevance, your effective objection, or the expiry of the limitation period\n              for our liability as a personal data controller;\n            </li> <li><b>DSA related obligations</b> \u2013 data relating to ensuring DSA compliance shall be processed until the\n              expiry of the statute of limitations on our liability as an intermediary service provider;\n            </li> <li><b>Storage of User Content</b> \u2014 data relating to the storage of User Content shall be stored until the\n              User Content is removed.\n            </li></ul> <p>\n            In the event that we process your personal data on the basis of consent you have given, you can withdraw\n            such consent at any time: either by your action or by contacting us using the contact details provided.\n            Please bear in mind that the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing which\n            was carried out on the basis of consent prior to its withdrawal.\n          </p></div> <div id=\"9\"><h2>#9: Who are the recipients of your personal data?</h2> <p>\n            We will risk saying that modern business cannot do without services provided by third parties. We also use\n            such services. Some of these are related to the processing of your personal data.

The providers of these tools guarantee an adequate level of protection of personal data\n            through appropriate compliance mechanisms provided for by the GDPR, in particular through the use of\n            standard contractual clauses.\n          </p> <p>\n            Currently, your data are transferred in connection with our use of the following solutions:\n          </p>  <p>\n            In addition, your personal data may be transferred to third countries in connection with the use of\n            cookies.

We do use tools that can take specific\n            actions depending on the information collected as part of the tracking mechanisms but we believe that\n            these actions do not have a significant impact on you for they do not differentiate your situation as a\n            customer, they do not affect the terms of the contract you can enter into with us, etc.\n          </p> <p>\n            Using certain tools, we may, for example, target personalised advertisements to you based on previous\n            actions taken by you within Calendesk.

It is the entity alone that decides the purposes and means of processing personal data within\n            the framework of the contract they enter into, and it is also the entity alone that is responsible for\n            complying with all obligations from the GDPR, including providing information about the principles of\n            personal data processing. In such a situation, we act as a processor who provides such a service provider\n            with the appropriate IT tool.\n           #2: Who can you contact regarding the processing of your personal\n            data? \n            As part of the implementation of personal data protection in our company, we have decided not to appoint a\n            data protection officer due to the fact that in our case it is not mandatory. For matters related to\n            personal data protection and broadly understood privacy, you can contact us at\n            support@calendesk.com.\n           #3: For what purposes do we process your personal data? \n            There is more than one such purpose. Below is a list of them followed by a more detailed discussion. We\n            have also assigned the appropriate legal grounds for processing to the individual purposes.\n            #4: What information do we have about you? \n            The scope of the data processed has been described precisely for each purpose of processing. For\n            information in this regard, please refer to section 3 of the Privacy\n            Policy above.\n           #5: What is \"Anonymous Information\"? \n            We use tools that collect a range of information about you related to your use of Calendesk. This\n            includes, in particular, the following information:\n           \n              information about your operating system and browser,\n             \n              pages viewed and user involvement,\n             \n              time spent on the Calendesk website,\n             \n              transitions between pages,\n             \n              clicks on individual links,\n             \n              the source from which you go to Calendesk,\n             \n              your age range,\n             \n              your gender,\n             \n              your approximate location limited to the town,\n             \n              your interests as determined by your online activity,\n             \n              platform statistics (iOS/Android/Web platforms),\n             \n              crashlytics (recording your device and location in the source code where crashes occurred).\n             \n            This information is referred to in this Privacy Policy as \"Anonymous Information\".\n           \n            Anonymous Information in itself does not, in our view, have the character of personal data, for it does\n            not allow us to identify you and we do not match it with the typical personal data we collect about you.\n            Nevertheless, given the strict jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the divided\n            opinions among lawyers, as a precaution, in case Anonymous Information is attributed the character of\n            personal data, we have also included detailed explanations in the Privacy Policy regarding the processing\n            of this information.\n           \n            The processing of Anonymous Information allows us to provide you with the functionality available within\n            Calendesk. In addition, Anonymous Information is used for analytical and statistical as well as marketing\n            purposes (e.g. creating Custom Audiences on Facebook, setting, targeting and directing advertisements).\n           \n            Anonymous Information is also processed by tool providers under the terms of their Terms of Conditions and\n            Privacy Policies. It may be used by these providers to provide, improve and manage services, develop new\n            services, measure the effectiveness of advertisements, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalise\n            the content and advertisements displayed on individual services, websites, and applications. Please see\n            the section on the tools we use for more detailed information.\n           #6: Where do we get your personal data from? \n            In most cases, you provide them to us yourself. For example, this is the case when you register a user\n            account, conclude a contract, send a complaint or withdraw from a contract, contact us via email or chat,\n            or use the functionalities available within Calendesk or external services (e.g. social networks).\n           \n            In addition, some information about you may be automatically collected by tools we use. For details on the\n            tools of external providers, please see the section on the tools we use.\n           \n            Additionally, in exceptional cases, we may also obtain your personal data from other sources, e.g. when\n            the entity that employs you indicates your data to us as a contact person for contractual matters, or when\n            you represent an entity that enters into a contract with us.\n           #7: Are your data secure? \n            We do care about the security of your personal data. We have analyzed the risks associated with the\n            various data processing processes and then implemented appropriate security and data protection measures.\n            We constantly monitor the state of our technical infrastructure, train our staff, observe the procedures\n            applied, and make necessary improvements.\n           #8: How long will we store your personal data? \n            We process your personal data for as long as it is justified within the framework of a given purpose for\n            processing your personal data, and therefore processing periods vary depending on the purpose. Please note\n            that the termination of the processing of your data for one purpose does not necessarily lead to the\n            complete erasure or destruction of your personal data since the same set of data may be processed for\n            another purpose, for the period of time indicated for that purpose. Complete erasure or destruction of\n            data occurs when all purposes have been completed and in other cases indicated in the GDPR.\n           \n            Below you will find a description of the processing periods:\n           User account \u2013 data related to the user account are processed for the duration of the user\n              account;\n             Conclusion and handling of the contract \u2013 contract-related data are processed for the time\n              necessary to conclude and perform the contract;\n             Complaints and withdrawals \u2013 data related to complaints and withdrawals are processed for the\n              time necessary to handle the complaint or withdrawal;\n             Contact and correspondence \u2013 data related to correspondence handling will be processed for the\n              duration of the contact between us;\n             Tax and accounting obligations \u2013 data related to the fulfilment of tax and accounting obligations\n              will be processed for the time prescribed by tax law, usually 5 years after the end of the tax year;\n             Archive \u2013 data related to the archive will be processed until the information contained in the\n              archive is no longer relevant;\n             Defence against claims, establishment of claims, and redress \u2013 data related to claims will be\n              processed until the claims are time-barred, and the period of limitation for claims may vary in light of\n              the applicable legislation (e.g. for businesses the standard period is 3 years);\n             Social media \u2013 data related to social media audience will be processed until you opt out of\n              interacting with us on social media;\n             Analysis and statistics \u2013 data related to analytics and statistics will be processed until they\n              are no longer useful or until you effectively object;\n             Own marketing \u2013 data related to own marketing will be processed until they become obsolete or\n              until you effectively object;\n             Ancillary tools \u2013 data related to ancillary tools will be processed until they are no longer\n              useful or you effectively object;\n             Data protection obligations \u2013 data related to the protection of personal data will be processed\n              until the expiry of their relevance, your effective objection, or the expiry of the limitation period\n              for our liability as a personal data controller;\n             DSA related obligations \u2013 data relating to ensuring DSA compliance shall be processed until the\n              expiry of the statute of limitations on our liability as an intermediary service provider;\n             Storage of User Content \u2014 data relating to the storage of User Content shall be stored until the\n              User Content is removed.\n             \n            In the event that we process your personal data on the basis of consent you have given, you can withdraw\n            such consent at any time: either by your action or by contacting us using the contact details provided.\n            Please bear in mind that the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing which\n            was carried out on the basis of consent prior to its withdrawal.\n           #9: Who are the recipients of your personal data? \n            We will risk saying that modern business cannot do without services provided by third parties. We also use\n            such services. Some of these are related to the processing of your personal data. The following processors\n            are involved in the processing of your personal data:\n           hosting provider \u2013 your data are stored on the server;\n             operators responsible for sending email and text message notifications \u2013 operators process your\n              contact details so that you are able to receive notifications;\n             entities that analyze traffic and user behavior \u2013 in order to conduct effective marketing\n              activities, these entities process data related to user behavior;\n             software houses \u2013 to the extent necessary to develop Calendesk functionality;\n             operators responsible for processing payments \u2013 to the extent necessary to make payments;\n             operators responsible for issuing and storing accounting documents \u2013 to the extent necessary to\n              issue and provide you with invoices for services;\n             internal CRM systems \u2013 so that we can efficiently manage our customer service;\n             accounting office \u2013 the office processes your personal data contained in invoices and other\n              accounting documents;\n             law firm \u2013 for the purpose of providing legal services to us;\n             other subcontractors, in particular IT solution providers \u2013 we cooperate with various\n              subcontractors who may have access to your personal data if they provide services in connection with\n              such access. In particular, this applies to the IT solutions we use in our operations.\n             \n            Should the need arise, your data may be shared with a legal advisor or attorney bound by professional\n            secrecy. The need may arise from the requirement for legal assistance involving access to your personal\n            information.\n           \n            Your personal data may also be transferred to tax offices to the extent necessary for the performance of\n            tax and accounting duties. This includes, in particular, all declarations, reports, statements, and other\n            accounting documents containing your personal data.\n           \n            In addition, if necessary, your personal data may be shared with entities, authorities, or institutions\n            entitled to obtain access to data on the basis of legal provisions, such as the police, security services,\n            courts, prosecutor\u2019s offices.\n           \n            Moreover, when it comes to Anonymous Information, the providers of the tools or plug-ins that collect\n            Anonymous Information have access to it. The providers of these tools are the independent controllers of\n            the data collected in them and may share these data under the terms and conditions they set forth in their\n            own terms and conditions and privacy policies, over which we have no control.\n           #10: Do we transfer your data to third countries or international\n            organizations? \n            Yes, part of the processing of your personal data may involve their transfer to third countries.\n           \n            We transfer your personal data to third countries in connection with the use of tools that store personal\n            data on servers located in third countries, in particular in the USA. The same may be true for Anonymous\n            Information. The providers of these tools guarantee an adequate level of protection of personal data\n            through appropriate compliance mechanisms provided for by the GDPR, in particular through the use of\n            standard contractual clauses.\n           \n            Currently, your data are transferred in connection with our use of the following solutions:\n            \n            In addition, your personal data may be transferred to third countries in connection with the use of\n            cookies. Please see the appendix to this Privacy Policy for details.\n           #11: Do we use profiling? Do we make automated decisions based on your\n            personal data? \n            We do not make decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that would have legal\n            effects on you or that would similarly significantly affect you. We do use tools that can take specific\n            actions depending on the information collected as part of the tracking mechanisms but we believe that\n            these actions do not have a significant impact on you for they do not differentiate your situation as a\n            customer, they do not affect the terms of the contract you can enter into with us, etc.\n           \n            Using certain tools, we may, for example, target personalised advertisements to you based on previous\n            actions taken by you within Calendesk. This is called behavioural advertising. We encourage you to learn\n            more about behavioural advertising, particularly with regard to privacy issues. Detailed information,\n            including the ability to manage your behavioural advertising settings, can be found\n            here.\n           #12: What rights do you have with regard to the processing of your\n            personal data? \n            The GDPR grants you the following potential rights related to the processing of your personal data:\n           \n              the right to access your data and obtain a copy thereof;\n             \n              the right to demand the rectification of the data;\n             \n              the right to erase the data (if in your opinion there are no grounds for us to process your data, you\n              can request that we erase them);\n             \n              the right to restriction of data processing (you can request that we restrict the processing of data\n              only to their storage or performance of activities agreed with you if in your opinion we have incorrect\n              data or we process them unjustifiably);\n             \n              the right to object to the processing of data (you have the right to object to the processing of data on\n              the basis of a legitimate interest; you should indicate a specific situation that, in your opinion,\n              justifies the termination of the processing covered by the objection; we will stop processing your data\n              for these purposes unless we prove that the grounds for data processing by us override your rights or\n              that your data are necessary for us to establish, assert, or defend claims);\n             \n              the right to transfer data (you have the right to receive from us, in a structured, commonly used,\n              machine-readable format, personal data that you provided to us on the basis of a contract or your\n              consent; you can commission us to send these data directly to another entity);\n             \n              the right to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data if you previously gave such consent;\n             \n              the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory body (if you find that we are processing data\n              unlawfully, you can submit a complaint to the President of the Personal Data Protection Office or\n              another competent supervisory authority).\n             \n            The rules related to the implementation of the above-mentioned rights are described in detail in Articles\n            16\u201321 of the GDPR. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these provisions. For our part, we\n            consider it necessary to explain to you that the above-mentioned rights are not absolute and you will not\n            be entitled to them in relation to all activities involving the processing of your personal data.\n           \n            We shall emphasize that you always have one of the rights indicated above \u2014 if you believe that we have\n            breached the provisions on the protection of personal data while processing your personal data, you have\n            the option to lodge a complaint with the supervisory body (the President of the Personal Data Protection\n            Office).\n           #13: Do we use cookies, and what are they exactly? \n            Calendesk, like almost all other applications or websites, uses cookies.\n            Cookies are small text information stored on your end device (e.g. computer, tablet, smartphone), which\n            can be read by our ICT system (first-party cookies) or ICT systems of third parties (third-party cookies).\n            Cookies can record and store certain information which ICT systems can then access for specific purposes.\n           \n            Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, i.e. after closing it\n            (so-called session cookies). Other cookies are stored on your end device and allow us to recognize you the\n            next time you visit Calendesk (persistent cookies).\n           \n            If you want to learn more about cookies as such, you can check, for example, this\n            material.\n           #14: On what basis do we use cookies? \n            We use cookies on the basis of your consent, except if the cookies are necessary for the proper provision\n            of electronic services to you.\n           \n            Cookies that are not necessary for the proper provision of the electronic service remain blocked until you\n            agree to the use of cookies. During your first visit to the Calendesk website, we display a message asking\n            for your consent along with the option to manage cookies, i.e. decide which cookies you agree to and which\n            you want to block.\n           #15: Can you disable cookies? \n            Yes, you can manage cookie settings within your web browser. You can block all or only selected cookies.\n            You can also block cookies from specific websites. You can also delete previously saved cookies and other\n            website and plug-in data at any time.\n           \n            Web browsers also offer the option of using incognito mode. You can use it if you do not want information\n            about visited pages and downloaded files to be saved in your browsing and download history. Cookies\n            created in incognito mode are deleted when you close all incognito mode windows.\n           \n            There are also browser plug-ins for controlling cookies, such as\n            Ghostery.\n            The option to control cookies may also be provided by additional software, in particular anti-virus\n            packages, etc.\n           \n            In addition, there are tools available on the Internet that allow you to control some types of cookies, in\n            particular for\n            collective management of behavioural advertising settings.\n           \n            Please bear in mind that disabling or limiting the use of cookies may prevent you from using some of the\n            functions available on Calendesk and cause difficulties in using Calendesk, as well as many other websites\n            that use cookies. For example, if you block cookies from social plug-ins, then buttons, widgets, and\n            social functions implemented on Calendesk may not be available to you.\n           #16: For what purposes do we use our own cookies? \n            First-party cookies are used to ensure the proper functioning of individual Calendesk mechanisms, such as\n            the correct submission of forms visible in Calendesk, etc.\n           \n            First-party cookies also store information about your defined cookie settings made from the cookie\n            management mechanism.\n           #17: What third-party cookies are used? \n            A list of tools that require the use of cookies and a description of the cookies used can be found in the\n            appendix to this Privacy Policy.\n           #18: Do we track your behaviour undertaken within Calendesk? \n            Yes, we use tools from third-party providers that involve collecting information about your activities\n            within Calendesk.

These tools are described in detail in the appendix to this Privacy Policy.\n           #20: How can you manage your privacy? \n            The answer to this question can be found in many places in this Privacy Policy when describing individual\n            tools, behavioural advertising, cookie consent, etc. However, for your convenience, we have collected this\n            information once again in one place. Below you will find a list of options for managing your privacy.\n           \n              cookie settings in the web browser;\n             \n              browser plug-ins supporting cookie management, e.g. Ghostery;\n             \n              additional cookie management software;\n             \n              incognito mode in a web browser;\n             \n              behavioural advertising settings, e.g. youronlinechoices.com;\n             \n              cookie management mechanism from the Calendesk level;\n             Google\n                Analytics Opt-out;\n             Google Ads\n                Settings.\n             #21: Is there anything else you should know about? \n            As you can see, the subject of personal data processing, the use of cookies, and general privacy\n            management is quite complicated.
