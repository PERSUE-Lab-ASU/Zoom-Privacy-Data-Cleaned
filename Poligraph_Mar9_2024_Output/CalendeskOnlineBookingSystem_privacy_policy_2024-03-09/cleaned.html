        </p> <div id="1"><h2 class="text-decoration-underline">#1: Who is the controller of your personal data?</h2> <p>
            The controller of your personal data is MPR Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, with its registered
            office in Warsaw at Floriańska Street 6/02, 03-707 Warsaw, entered into the National Court Register by the
            District Court for the Capital City of Warsaw in Warsaw, XII Commercial Division of the National Court

          </p> <p>
            Due to the very nature of Calendesk, you should also bear in mind that, independently of us, the
            controller of your personal data is the entity which provides the services within the scope of their
            business. It is the entity alone that decides the purposes and means of processing personal data within
            the framework of the contract they enter into, and it is also the entity alone that is responsible for
            complying with all obligations from the GDPR, including providing information about the principles of
            personal data processing. In such a situation, we act as a processor who provides such a service provider
            with the appropriate IT tool.

            data?</h2> <p>
            As part of the implementation of personal data protection in our company, we have decided not to appoint a
            data protection officer due to the fact that in our case it is not mandatory. For matters related to
            personal data protection and broadly understood privacy, you can contact us at
            <a href="mailto:support@calendesk.com">support@calendesk.com</a>.
          </p></div> <div id="3"><h2 class="text-decoration-underline">#3: For what purposes do we process your personal data?</h2> <p>
            There is more than one such purpose. Below is a list of them followed by a more detailed discussion. We
            have also assigned the appropriate legal grounds for processing to the individual purposes.

                    Within the framework of editing your account data, you can provide further data, in particular

                    and surname, invoice details (in the case of paid services).
                    In addition, the system used to operate Calendesk saves your IP number, which you used when

            We use tools that collect a range of information about you related to your use of Calendesk. This

            This information is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Anonymous Information".
          </p> <p>
            Anonymous Information in itself does not, in our view, have the character of personal data, for it does
            not allow us to identify you and we do not match it with the typical personal data we collect about you.
            Nevertheless, given the strict jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the divided
            opinions among lawyers, as a precaution, in case Anonymous Information is attributed the character of
            personal data, we have also included detailed explanations in the Privacy Policy regarding the processing
            of this information.
          </p> <p>
            The processing of Anonymous Information allows us to provide you with the functionality available within
            Calendesk. In addition, Anonymous Information is used for analytical and statistical as well as marketing
            purposes (e.g. creating Custom Audiences on Facebook, setting, targeting and directing advertisements).
          </p> <p>
            Anonymous Information is also processed by tool providers under the terms of their Terms of Conditions and
            Privacy Policies. It may be used by these providers to provide, improve and manage services, develop new
            services, measure the effectiveness of advertisements, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalise
            the content and advertisements displayed on individual services, websites, and applications. Please see
            the section on the tools we use for more detailed information.
          </p></div> <div id="6"><h2 class="text-decoration-underline">#6: Where do we get your personal data from?</h2> <p>
            In most cases, you provide them to us yourself. For example, this is the case when you register a user
            account, conclude a contract, send a complaint or withdraw from a contract, contact us via email or chat,
            or use the functionalities available within Calendesk or external services (e.g. social networks).
          </p> <p>
            In addition, some information about you may be automatically collected by tools we use. For details on the
            tools of external providers, please see the section on the tools we use.
          </p> <p>
            Additionally, in exceptional cases, we may also obtain your personal data from other sources, e.g. when
            the entity that employs you indicates your data to us as a contact person for contractual matters, or when
            you represent an entity that enters into a contract with us.
          </p></div> <div id="7"><h2 class="text-decoration-underline">#7: Are your data secure?</h2> <p>
            We do care about the security of your personal data. We have analyzed the risks associated with the
            various data processing processes and then implemented appropriate security and data protection measures.
            We constantly monitor the state of our technical infrastructure, train our staff, observe the procedures
            applied, and make necessary improvements.
          </p></div> <div id="8"><h2 class="text-decoration-underline">#8: How long will we store your personal data?</h2> <p>
            We process your personal data for as long as it is justified within the framework of a given purpose for
            processing your personal data, and therefore processing periods vary depending on the purpose. Please note
            that the termination of the processing of your data for one purpose does not necessarily lead to the
            complete erasure or destruction of your personal data since the same set of data may be processed for
            another purpose, for the period of time indicated for that purpose. Complete erasure or destruction of
            data occurs when all purposes have been completed and in other cases indicated in the GDPR.

            such consent at any time: either by your action or by contacting us using the contact details provided.
            Please bear in mind that the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing which

          </p></div> <div id="9"><h2 class="text-decoration-underline">#9: Who are the recipients of your personal data?</h2> <p>
            We will risk saying that modern business cannot do without services provided by third parties. We also use
            such services. Some of these are related to the processing of your personal data. The following processors
            are involved in the processing of your personal data:

              such access. In particular, this applies to the IT solutions we use in our operations.
            </li></ul> <p>
            Should the need arise, your data may be shared with a legal advisor or attorney bound by professional
            secrecy. The need may arise from the requirement for legal assistance involving access to your personal
            information.
          </p> <p>
            Your personal data may also be transferred to tax offices to the extent necessary for the performance of
            tax and accounting duties. This includes, in particular, all declarations, reports, statements, and other
            accounting documents containing your personal data.
          </p> <p>
            In addition, if necessary, your personal data may be shared with entities, authorities, or institutions
            entitled to obtain access to data on the basis of legal provisions, such as the police, security services,
            courts, prosecutor’s offices.
          </p> <p>
            Moreover, when it comes to Anonymous Information, the providers of the tools or plug-ins that collect
            Anonymous Information have access to it. The providers of these tools are the independent controllers of
            the data collected in them and may share these data under the terms and conditions they set forth in their
            own terms and conditions and privacy policies, over which we have no control.

            Yes, part of the processing of your personal data may involve their transfer to third countries.
          </p> <p>
            We transfer your personal data to third countries in connection with the use of tools that store personal
            data on servers located in third countries, in particular in the USA. The same may be true for Anonymous
            Information. The providers of these tools guarantee an adequate level of protection of personal data

            personal data?</h2> <p>
            We do not make decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that would have legal
            effects on you or that would similarly significantly affect you. We do use tools that can take specific
            actions depending on the information collected as part of the tracking mechanisms but we believe that
            these actions do not have a significant impact on you for they do not differentiate your situation as a
            customer, they do not affect the terms of the contract you can enter into with us, etc.
          </p> <p>
            Using certain tools, we may, for example, target personalised advertisements to you based on previous
            actions taken by you within Calendesk. This is called behavioural advertising. We encourage you to learn
            more about behavioural advertising, particularly with regard to privacy issues. Detailed information,

            personal data?</h2> <p>
            The GDPR grants you the following potential rights related to the processing of your personal data:
          </p> <ul class="mb-4"><li>
              the right to access your data and obtain a copy thereof;
            </li> <li>
              the right to demand the rectification of the data;
            </li> <li>
              the right to erase the data (if in your opinion there are no grounds for us to process your data, you
              can request that we erase them);
            </li> <li>
              the right to restriction of data processing (you can request that we restrict the processing of data
              only to their storage or performance of activities agreed with you if in your opinion we have incorrect
              data or we process them unjustifiably);
            </li> <li>
              the right to object to the processing of data (you have the right to object to the processing of data on
              the basis of a legitimate interest; you should indicate a specific situation that, in your opinion,
              justifies the termination of the processing covered by the objection; we will stop processing your data
              for these purposes unless we prove that the grounds for data processing by us override your rights or
              that your data are necessary for us to establish, assert, or defend claims);
            </li> <li>
              the right to transfer data (you have the right to receive from us, in a structured, commonly used,
              machine-readable format, personal data that you provided to us on the basis of a contract or your
              consent; you can commission us to send these data directly to another entity);
            </li> <li>
              the right to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data if you previously gave such consent;
            </li> <li>
              the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory body (if you find that we are processing data
              unlawfully, you can submit a complaint to the President of the Personal Data Protection Office or
              another competent supervisory authority).
            </li></ul> <p>
            The rules related to the implementation of the above-mentioned rights are described in detail in Articles
            16–21 of the GDPR. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these provisions. For our part, we
            consider it necessary to explain to you that the above-mentioned rights are not absolute and you will not
            be entitled to them in relation to all activities involving the processing of your personal data.
          </p> <p>
            We shall emphasize that you always have one of the rights indicated above — if you believe that we have
            breached the provisions on the protection of personal data while processing your personal data, you have
            the option to lodge a complaint with the supervisory body (the President of the Personal Data Protection
            Office).

                    Google Analytics automatically collects information about your use of our website. The information
                    collected in this way is most often transferred to Google servers, which can be located all over

                  </p> <p>
                    Due to the IP anonymization we have activated, your IP address is shortened before being
                    forwarded. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to Google servers and
                    shortened there. The anonymized IP address provided by your browser as part of Google Analytics
                    is, as a rule, not combined with other Google data.
                  </p> <p>
                    We would like to emphasize that within Google Analytics we only have access to Anonymous

                    Google Analytics and Google Analytics 360 services have been certified by the independent security
                    standard ISO 27001. ISO 27001 is one of the most recognized standards in the world that certifies

                    to target you with an ad for that product or any other ad we deem appropriate. This advertisement
                    will be displayed to you within the Google network when you use the Internet, browse other

                    Further processing of information takes place only if you have given your consent to Google to

                    personalize the ads that are displayed on the websites. In such a situation, Google will use your
                    data to create and define target audience lists for remarketing purposes on different devices. For
                    this purpose, Google temporarily combines the information it collects with other data it possesses

                    For the purpose of eliminating bugs in the application, we use a tool called Bugsnag, which is
                    developed by SmartBear Software Inc. based at 450 Artisan Way, Somerville, MA 02145, USA. With
                    this tool, we can constantly monitor the application’s functioning as well as its stability. If
                    errors are detected during the user's use of the application, we can take appropriate
                    countermeasures and improve Calendesk's functionality. The collected data are anonymous and are
                    used to analyze errors and eliminate them from Calendesk.
