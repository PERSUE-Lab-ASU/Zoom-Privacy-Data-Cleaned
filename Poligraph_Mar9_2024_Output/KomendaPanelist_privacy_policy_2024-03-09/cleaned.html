If you use a third party to create your account or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party (such as a social network, virtual meeting provider, etc.) based on your registration and privacy settings on that third-party service.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.2 Information We May Collect.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera&nbsp;may use cookies, web beacons, web analytics, or other technologies to automatically collect certain information about you when you visit Komenda, utilize other Wedzera products, or otherwise, interact with us. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Please note, these may be first-party cookies or tools, which are hosted within an Wedzera domain name, or third-party cookies or tools, which are hosted by another party. Please reference the Komenda Cookie Policy for further information.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.3 Information Collected from Other Sources.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera&nbsp;is only interested in facilitating a good event experience for the audience, the panelists, the host(s) and the event organizer. &nbsp;There is typically no need to obtain additional information about you from other sources, including updated addresses, contact information, demographic information, or other publicly available data. &nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.4 Combination of Information.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera&nbsp;may combine the information it receives from and about you, including personal information, non-personal information, and information collected offline, with information collected from third-party sources.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera uses customized and proprietary software code to analyze information on how users interact with its products.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3 Data Use</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera&nbsp;may use the information we collect to: (a) Administer or operate Wedzera products, services, or Websites, including completing a transaction, providing you or the event organizer with products or user support, responding to your requests for information, preventing transactional fraud, or otherwise contacting you; (b) Research, address, develop, and improve the usage and operations of the existing or new Wedzera products and services; (c) Protect the security or integrity of the product and our business; and (d) Perform any other functions as otherwise described to you at the point of data collection.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4 Data Sharing</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera&nbsp;may disclose the information we collect from and about you (a) to the event organizer, our third-party service providers, partners, and distributors to enable the service provider, partner, or distributor to perform a business, professional, or technical support function for Wedzera; (b) in association with law enforcement, fraud prevention, a subpoena, or other legal or government investigatory action; (c) as required by law, rule, or regulation; (d) if Wedzera reasonably believes it is required to protect Wedzera, its customers, or the public; or (e) as described to you at the point of collection.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Except as otherwise set forth herein, Wedzera may provide aggregated statistics about users to third parties, but such information will be aggregated so that it does not identify a particular individual or company.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera is not in the business of selling or renting your personally identifiable information to others and will not share your personally identifiable information with others, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Information provided by users, panelists, or hosts in Komenda during an event in the form of chat comments, questions, or any other contributions will be viewable to the other attendees of the event. &nbsp;Wedzera cannot control how others will use information available to them in connection with an event. &nbsp;The event organizer is responsible for setting expectations according to acceptable use of information provided to the event by the organizers and the attendees.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">5 Data Storage</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera&nbsp;operates globally, using the Internet to collect and process your information necessarily involves the transmission and storage of data on an international basis.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Therefore, by using our Website, our products, and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge our processing of your information in this way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may transfer your personal information to our global locations or to destinations of our storage facilities and/or our third-party providers, including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your personal information may be stored on servers in a global location. It may also be processed by staff operating outside of the EEA, who work for us or one of our suppliers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Some of these locations may have data protection standards that are different from those in your country. For EEA residents, we have taken commercially reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, your personal information may be subject to the laws of other countries, where the data protection and other laws may differ from those of your country of residence.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your personal information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities in the countries in which we operate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In practice, Komenda does not retain the comments and questions from a given event beyond maintaining user accounts that utilizes the user’s name and email address or phone number to facilitate future login into the Komenda system without re-registering. The event organizer may save information from the event (such as the questions asked or the comments in chat), but will then store that information according to the organizer’s own data management practices and procedures. &nbsp;All the event data (questions, comments, activity log, etc.) is expunged when the event organizer resets the Komenda instance to prepare it for a subsequent event. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Apart from user login credentials, the duration of data storage in Komenda is a function of the distance in time between one event and a future event that follows it. &nbsp;User login credentials are maintained as long as the event organizer maintains an active instance of the Komenda solution.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">6 Marketing Choices</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In practice, Wedzera does not utilize user contact information from its clients’ events for its own marketing purposes. &nbsp;If a user independently subscribes to a Komenda, Mukana, or Wedzera product or website for the purposes of joining a mailing list, the user may be contacted by Wedzera.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the case that individuals independently subscribe to a newsletter, Wedzera&nbsp;may periodically send you emails with information regarding Wedzera, its products, or its partners. If you no longer wish to continue receiving such information, please click the “unsubscribe” link available at the bottom of the relevant email.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can also contact Wedzera at data-protection@wedzera.com&nbsp;and let Wedzera know that you no longer wish to receive such information. Alternatively, you can reply to an email from Wedzera and type “REMOVE” in the subject line.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">7 Public Forums</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any information that you may disclose on community forums or other public areas of the Website (“User Contribution”) becomes public information, and you are solely responsible for your User Contributions.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera has no responsibility for any information, including personally identifiable information, that you choose to submit in these forums.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We do encourage you to exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas, as Wedzera has no control over who has access to or how they might utilize said information.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, Wedzera is not responsible for any circumvention by third parties of any privacy setting or security measures contained on the Website or in the Komenda product.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Even after removal, your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached or archived pages or may have been copied or stored by other Website users.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Proper access and use of information on the Website, including User Contributions, is governed by this Privacy Statement and the Terms of Use relating thereto.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any known or suspected violations should be reported at data-protection@wedzera.com.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">8 Third-Party Sites</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Website may include links to third-party websites for your convenience and information only. Wedzera does not own or control these third-party websites.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wedzera is not responsible for the availability, content, data collection, utilization of data, use of cookies, or otherwise on the third-party websites, and any data that you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by this Privacy Statement.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting any information to them. If you have any questions about how such third parties’ privacy and data use practices, you should contact such third parties directly.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">9 How to Update and Access Information</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Certain areas of this Product Website will require you to provide certain personal information. It is your responsibility to provide the most recent available and accurate information.
