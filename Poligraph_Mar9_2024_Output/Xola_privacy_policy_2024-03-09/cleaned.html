Some features on our Website will not function if you do not allow cookies. We may link the information we store in cookies to any Collected Information you submit while on our Website.</p>



<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

In some cases, we tie the information gathered by Web Beacons to your Collected Information. For example, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>



<p><strong>Third Party Tracking Technologies:</strong>&nbsp;The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company or third party service provider is not covered by our privacy statement.</p>



<p><strong>Analytics Software:</strong>&nbsp;We and our third party tracking-utility partners use log files on our Digital Properties to gather certain information automatically and store it for analytical purposes.
