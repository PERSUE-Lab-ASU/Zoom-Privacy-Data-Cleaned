<h2>5. RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>5.1 We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>6. TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>6.1 The Gist Services and Sites, and our messenger domains are provided and hosted in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, we may transfer, and process, your personal data outside of the country in which you are resident to our service providers including to, Ireland, the UK, Australia and other such countries as we deem appropriate from time to time. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). We will protect your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.</p>
<p>6.2 Certain recipients (our service providers and other companies) who process your personal data on our behalf may also transfer personal data outside the country in which you are resident. Where such transfers occur, we will make sure that an appropriate transfer agreement is put in place to protect your personal data.</p>
<p>6.3 If you are a resident of the EEA, the UK or Switzerland, we will protect your personal data when it is transferred outside of the EEA, the UK or Switzerland by processing it in a territory which the European Commission has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal data; or otherwise ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data. For transfers of your personal data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>recipients who are located outside of the EEA, the UK or Switzerland, following the invalidation of the Privacy Shield we will rely on Standard Contractual Clauses.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. HOW WE STORE AND SAFEGUARD PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>We care about protecting personal data. That is why we put in place appropriate measures that are designed to secure your personal data. You can find out more about our technical and organizational safeguards on our Security page: <a data-mil="105" href="https://getgist.com/security" data-wpel-link="internal">https://getgist.com/security</a>.</p>
<h2>8. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h2>
<p>8.1 Depending on your location and subject to applicable laws, you may have certain data protection rights. If you are a resident of the EEA or the UK you have the following data protection rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal data, you can do so at any time.</li>
<li>You can object to processing of your personal data, ask us to restrict processing of your personal data or request portability of your personal data.</li>
<li>You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by clicking on the ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù or ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù link in the communications we send you. Please note, however, that it may not be possible to opt-out of certain service-related communications. You can let us know at any time if you do not wish to receive marketing messages by contacting us on the Gist Messenger or by contacting us using the contact details below.</li>
<li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
<li>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA and the UK are available <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.2 You can exercise any of these rights by submitting a request through our <a href="https://survey.getgist.com/ccdbqywrk1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Privacy Request Form</a>.</p>
