<p>Any sharing or transferring of your personal information is done in accordance with applicable data protection laws, and we will take appropriate safeguards to ensure its integrity and protection.</p>
<h4>To Provide Products, Services, and Information</h4>
<p>As described above, we collect information from you so that we can provide products and services that you purchase using our Site. We may provide information to third party vendors who assist us in processing and completing transactions requested by you in accordance with the products and services we offer. For example, we may use third party vendors to help host our website, send out e-mail updates about the Site, process payments, and assist with marketing services.

<h4>Online Account</h4>

However, AppointmentCore is a global technology company, and you agree and acknowledge by using our Site that AppointmentCore may transmit your PII outside of the United States.

We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites.</p>
