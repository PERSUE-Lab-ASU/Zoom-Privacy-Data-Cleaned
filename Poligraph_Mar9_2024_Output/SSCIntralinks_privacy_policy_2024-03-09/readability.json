For further information about Cookies, please see our \"Cookies\" section below.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2\">What information does Intralinks collect about users of its Service and how is this information used?</h2>\n\n<p>This section applies to users of the Intralinks Service. If you only use our public website, this section does not apply to you. If you, your employer or a third party decide to purchase our Service, we will use your Personal Information for purposes of providing the Service to you. We will also provide your Personal Information to trusted partners and our affiliates who work on behalf of Intralinks and use your Personal Information to help Intralinks provide the Service. Such partners include database providers, data analytics providers (such as Amazon Web Services) and other suppliers who assist with providing technical support. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in performing the contract that we have entered into with you, your employer or a third party and in providing, managing and administering our Service.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Setting Up the Service</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>In this Privacy Notice, an \u201cExchange\u201d or a \u201cWorkspace\u201d mean a portion of the Service configured to permit authorized users to access and share information. The manager of an Exchange, the owner of a Workspace, your employer or an affiliate or partner of your employer, who is using the Service, may add you as a participant in one or more Exchanges or Workspaces. The person adding you for the first time to an Exchange or Workspace will provide certain Personal Information about you, such as your name, company name, work email address and work telephone number. We will provide you with a user ID (an email address) and account activation email to access the Service and create a user \u201cprofile\u201d for use as described below.</p>\n\n<p>When you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with your \u201cprofile,\u201d which contains the information supplied to us. You will be able to update or correct any of the Personal Information in your profile. As the Service is intended for business purposes only, unless your place of work is also your home, you should only enter business contact information. We use this information to provide the Service and to identify how you'd like to use your account. We use this information because it is necessary to provide you with an account and because we have a legitimate business interest in enabling you to update your preferences and settings online.</p>\n\n<p>Once your Personal Information has been entered into your profile, this information is added to the participant list for each Exchange or Workspace you have been authorized to access. Other participants of your Exchange(s) or Workspace(s) may then have access to your Personal Information. You may receive certain emails relating to your use of the Service, such as email alerts related to Exchanges or Workspaces on which you are a participant and other email communications relating to the Service. Emails will be sent to the email address(es) listed in your profile.</p>\n\n<p>Your Personal Information is also added to Intralinks' global directory of current and former users of the Service (the \u201cGUD\u201d). If you are selected to join another Exchange or Workspace in the future, your user ID will be authorized to access that Exchange, and your Personal Information will be added to the participant list for that Exchange or Workspace. Our clients also have the ability to maintain one or more \u201cbusiness groups,\u201d which are contact lists comprised of all users that have used the Exchanges or Workspaces that they have managed. Your Personal Information may be added to one or more of these business groups.</p>\n\n<p>We use your Personal Information as set forth above to provide, manage and facilitate your use of the Service, whether now or in the future. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in performing the contract that we have entered into with your employer, or with the affiliate or partner of your employer (as applicable). We will keep this information for as long as you remain an Intralinks account holder.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Reports and Analytics</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>As a function of the Service and in order to conduct internal analysis of use of the Service, Intralinks also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service (e.g. access to Exchanges, Workspaces and documents, including time, date and length of access). This includes maintaining a log of users' IP addresses, the websites from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser's settings that may affect Service performance. The information described in this paragraph is referred to as \u201cUsage Log Information.\u201d It may also be combined with Usage Log Information about other users of an Exchange or Workspace you are permissioned into to provide an overall view of how the Exchange or Workspace is used.</p>\n\n<p>Usage Log Information will be recorded and used internally within Intralinks and may also be made available to managers of Exchanges, owners of Workspaces, Service licensees or to your employer or entity on whose behalf you are accessing the Service.</p>\n\n<p>We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in understanding how our Service is accessed, how it is used and whether there are any potential security issues arising from such use. &nbsp;We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that allows us to provide the Service, to perform the contract that we have entered into with your employer, or with the affiliate or partner of your employer (as applicable) and to understand how people use our Service.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Support</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>We share Usage Log Information, as well as information about your browser and other local computer settings, with Exchange managers and Workspace owners in order to troubleshoot or avoid potential access problems. We also use this information (in addition to your contact information) to contact you in relation to providing you with support, including where you have already contacted us via telephone, email or our \"Chat with Us\" function. Where necessary, we disclose this information to trusted support providers (such as RightNow (Oracle)) who will undertake this role on our behalf.</p>\n\n<p>We need this information to provide you with support requested. We use and disclose this information to provide the Service and provide relevant support services. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in ensuring that you receive an effective Service from us. We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand any technical issues that users have with our Service.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Exchange Managers and Workspace Owners</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>If you have been designated by your organisation as an Exchange manager or Workspace owner, we will use your Personal Information when we are undertaking work on behalf of your organisation, for example adding participants for the first time to an Exchange or Workspace. We use your Personal Information because it is necessary for our contract with your organisation that we interact with you in order to comply with your organisation's instructions. We may also notify you when the Exchange is about to be suspended, in the event where your organisation has an overdue balance and we have not been able to reach out to, or get a response from, your organisation\u2019s billing department. We will keep this information for as long as your organisation has a relationship with us.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Marketing</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>If you are a user of the Service and we have a permission to send you marketing messages, we will use your Personal Information to contact you about our services and products. We will contact you either by email or phone. We also use Usage Log Information to better tailor these communications to you by identifying those features and aspects of our services that are most relevant to you based on your historic usage.</p>\n\n<p>You may decline to receive mail or email from us by selecting the opt-out link which will be contained in any such email that you receive, or by contacting us using the details at <a href=\"file:///privacy#5\">How can I change, update or delete my contact information or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?</a></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Sale or Merger of Intralinks</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Subject to applicable law, as the GUD is a business asset of Intralinks, if Intralinks were sold to or merged with another company, the GUD (which includes your Personal Information) may be transferred to a successor of the company, or to a subsidiary or affiliate of Intralinks, who will agree to abide by the terms of this Privacy Notice. You have the right to request that your Personal Information be removed from the GUD at any time (see below).</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Legal Requirements</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>We will also disclose personal information (1) in response to lawful requests by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements) and, where applicable, in accordance with our internal policy on access by government or regulatory authorities and (2) in our sole discretion if we believe that such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government or regulatory investigation or in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Intralinks may also process your Personal Information if necessary in the defence of a legal claim. We will not delete Personal Information if relevant to an investigation or a dispute. It will continue to be stored until those issues are fully resolved.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2b\">What information could Intralinks otherwise collect about me?</h2>\n\n<p><em><strong>Billing</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>If you have been designated by your organisation as being a contact for billing or payment purposes, we will use your Personal Information to process your organisation's order, issue invoices to your organisation and take payment from, or make payment to, you (including refunds if applicable). We use this information because it is necessary for our contract with your organisation that we collect information from its representatives to process payments or give or receive refunds. We will keep information relating to payments for the length of the contract between us and for ten (10) years afterwards.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Reviews and Feedback</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>If you are a user of an Exchange or Workspace and you contact Intralinks to provide feedback or reviews of your experience, we will use your Personal Information (as well as your feedback/review) to understand and respond to customer feedback. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in understanding customer feedback and in responding to your communications in a consistent way. We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand and assess people\u2019s experience of our Service.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"3\">How does Intralinks protect the security of my Personal Information?</h2>\n\n<p>Intralinks has implemented and currently maintains an effective written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards and other security measures necessary to (a) ensure the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your Personal Information; (b) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your Personal Information; (c) protect against unauthorized access to, destruction, modification, disclosure or use of your Personal Information; and (d) detect and respond to security incidents involving your Personal Information.

Where such transfers of your Personal Information are made they will be made in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Transfer of Information to Other Countries \u2013 Users in European Economic Area (EEA)</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>We store your Personal Information on cloud servers located in the United States. In addition, we use suppliers in the United States that support the provision of our Service. The transfer of this information is governed by a contract including standard contractual clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission.</p>\n\n<p>Where our U.S. affiliates process information about EEA users, the transfer of this information is governed by SCCs approved by the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our Customer Support team may, depending on the time that support is requested by a user, be provided by personnel located in our affiliates' offices outside the EEA or by third-party contractors located in the Philippines (IntegrityNet). The transfer to our affiliates and third-party subcontractors is governed by SCCs approved by the European Commission.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"5\">How can I change, update or delete my Personal Information, or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?</h2>\n\n<p>You can change or update your Personal Information at any time, regardless of whether you are a current or former user of the Service, by logging into the Service with your user ID and password and accessing your profile.

If you, your employer or a third party decide to purchase our Service, we will use your Personal Information for purposes of providing the Service to you. We will also provide your Personal Information to trusted partners and our affiliates who work on behalf of Intralinks and use your Personal Information to help Intralinks provide the Service.

We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in performing the contract that we have entered into with you, your employer or a third party and in providing, managing and administering our Service.\n\nSetting Up the Service\n\nIn this Privacy Notice, an \u201cExchange\u201d or a \u201cWorkspace\u201d mean a portion of the Service configured to permit authorized users to access and share information. The manager of an Exchange, the owner of a Workspace, your employer or an affiliate or partner of your employer, who is using the Service, may add you as a participant in one or more Exchanges or Workspaces. The person adding you for the first time to an Exchange or Workspace will provide certain Personal Information about you, such as your name, company name, work email address and work telephone number. We will provide you with a user ID (an email address) and account activation email to access the Service and create a user \u201cprofile\u201d for use as described below.\n\nWhen you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with your \u201cprofile,\u201d which contains the information supplied to us. You will be able to update or correct any of the Personal Information in your profile. As the Service is intended for business purposes only, unless your place of work is also your home, you should only enter business contact information. We use this information to provide the Service and to identify how you'd like to use your account. We use this information because it is necessary to provide you with an account and because we have a legitimate business interest in enabling you to update your preferences and settings online.\n\nOnce your Personal Information has been entered into your profile, this information is added to the participant list for each Exchange or Workspace you have been authorized to access. Other participants of your Exchange(s) or Workspace(s) may then have access to your Personal Information. You may receive certain emails relating to your use of the Service, such as email alerts related to Exchanges or Workspaces on which you are a participant and other email communications relating to the Service. Emails will be sent to the email address(es) listed in your profile.\n\nYour Personal Information is also added to Intralinks' global directory of current and former users of the Service (the \u201cGUD\u201d). If you are selected to join another Exchange or Workspace in the future, your user ID will be authorized to access that Exchange, and your Personal Information will be added to the participant list for that Exchange or Workspace. Our clients also have the ability to maintain one or more \u201cbusiness groups,\u201d which are contact lists comprised of all users that have used the Exchanges or Workspaces that they have managed. Your Personal Information may be added to one or more of these business groups.\n\nWe use your Personal Information as set forth above to provide, manage and facilitate your use of the Service, whether now or in the future. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in performing the contract that we have entered into with your employer, or with the affiliate or partner of your employer (as applicable). We will keep this information for as long as you remain an Intralinks account holder.\n\nReports and Analytics\n\nAs a function of the Service and in order to conduct internal analysis of use of the Service, Intralinks also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service (e.g. access to Exchanges, Workspaces and documents, including time, date and length of access). This includes maintaining a log of users' IP addresses, the websites from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser's settings that may affect Service performance. The information described in this paragraph is referred to as \u201cUsage Log Information.\u201d It may also be combined with Usage Log Information about other users of an Exchange or Workspace you are permissioned into to provide an overall view of how the Exchange or Workspace is used.\n\nUsage Log Information will be recorded and used internally within Intralinks and may also be made available to managers of Exchanges, owners of Workspaces, Service licensees or to your employer or entity on whose behalf you are accessing the Service.\n\nWe use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in understanding how our Service is accessed, how it is used and whether there are any potential security issues arising from such use. \u00a0We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that allows us to provide the Service, to perform the contract that we have entered into with your employer, or with the affiliate or partner of your employer (as applicable) and to understand how people use our Service.\n\nSupport\n\nWe share Usage Log Information, as well as information about your browser and other local computer settings, with Exchange managers and Workspace owners in order to troubleshoot or avoid potential access problems. We also use this information (in addition to your contact information) to contact you in relation to providing you with support, including where you have already contacted us via telephone, email or our \"Chat with Us\" function. Where necessary, we disclose this information to trusted support providers (such as RightNow (Oracle)) who will undertake this role on our behalf.\n\nWe need this information to provide you with support requested. We use and disclose this information to provide the Service and provide relevant support services. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in ensuring that you receive an effective Service from us. We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand any technical issues that users have with our Service.\n\nExchange Managers and Workspace Owners\n\nIf you have been designated by your organisation as an Exchange manager or Workspace owner, we will use your Personal Information when we are undertaking work on behalf of your organisation, for example adding participants for the first time to an Exchange or Workspace. We use your Personal Information because it is necessary for our contract with your organisation that we interact with you in order to comply with your organisation's instructions. We may also notify you when the Exchange is about to be suspended, in the event where your organisation has an overdue balance and we have not been able to reach out to, or get a response from, your organisation\u2019s billing department. We will keep this information for as long as your organisation has a relationship with us.\n\nMarketing\n\nIf you are a user of the Service and we have a permission to send you marketing messages, we will use your Personal Information to contact you about our services and products.
