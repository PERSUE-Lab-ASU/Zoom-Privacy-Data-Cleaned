<p><em><strong>Anyone Who Contacts Us through Our Website</strong></em></p>

<p>Intralinks collects certain Personal Information through its website when you choose to submit such information to us through email, an online form or other method (such as contacting us through our "Contact Us" or "Chat with Sales" website functions). This includes Personal Information you provide to Intralinks in order to request additional information about the Service, employment opportunities, for press inquiries or for other purposes. We use information collected through our website to respond to specific requests for information about our Service and other inquiries.</p>

<p>You do not need to provide this information to us but if you don't, we will not be able to respond to your communication. We use this information to answer any issues or concerns and to monitor customer/potential customer communications for quality and training purposes. We also use this information to develop new services and to improve or personalise existing services. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in understanding customer/potential customer feedback and in responding to your communications in a consistent way. We will keep this information for as long as you have a relationship with us or, if you do not have a relationship with us beyond this communication, for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand how people use our website.</p>

<p><em><strong>Visitors to Our Website</strong></em></p>

<p>Intralinks also maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to our website, including but not limited to a visitor's IP address (a computer's numerical Internet address), the websites from which visitors access our website, the type of web browsers used to access our website, the device used to access our website and the pages viewed. Such information may be treated as Personal Information about the visitor in accordance with applicable local law.</p>

<p>You do not need to provide this information to us and can, in certain circumstances, stop us from collecting it using the details in "How can I contact Intralinks about this Privacy Notice?" Intralinks uses this information to monitor the way our website is used and identify issues with the website and users' experience of it. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in understanding how our website is accessed, how it is used and any problems users have with it across multiple devices. We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand how people use our website and any technical issues they have.</p>

<p><em><strong>Marketing</strong></em></p>

<p>If we have collected your Personal Information through our website or through other channels (such as if you have exchanged contact information with one of our Sales representatives or partner constituents, or have included your Personal Information in an event registration form), and we have a permission to do so, we will &nbsp;use your Personal Information to inform you about other Intralinks services and products that might be of interest to you and to gather feedback from you on our website and our Service. &nbsp;We use this information because Intralinks has a legitimate business interest to promote its products and services. We will keep your Personal Information for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand how people use our Service and the impact of any marketing offers that we make.</p>

<p><em><strong>Cookies</strong></em></p>

<p>We also collect information about website users through “cookies.” Cookies are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser which allow the server to uniquely identify the browser on each page. For further information about Cookies, please see our "Cookies" section below.</p>

<h2 id="2">What information does Intralinks collect about users of its Service and how is this information used?</h2>

<p>This section applies to users of the Intralinks Service. If you only use our public website, this section does not apply to you. If you, your employer or a third party decide to purchase our Service, we will use your Personal Information for purposes of providing the Service to you. We will also provide your Personal Information to trusted partners and our affiliates who work on behalf of Intralinks and use your Personal Information to help Intralinks provide the Service. Such partners include database providers, data analytics providers (such as Amazon Web Services) and other suppliers who assist with providing technical support. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in performing the contract that we have entered into with you, your employer or a third party and in providing, managing and administering our Service.</p>

<p><em><strong>Setting Up the Service</strong></em></p>

<p>In this Privacy Notice, an “Exchange” or a “Workspace” mean a portion of the Service configured to permit authorized users to access and share information. The manager of an Exchange, the owner of a Workspace, your employer or an affiliate or partner of your employer, who is using the Service, may add you as a participant in one or more Exchanges or Workspaces. The person adding you for the first time to an Exchange or Workspace will provide certain Personal Information about you, such as your name, company name, work email address and work telephone number. We will provide you with a user ID (an email address) and account activation email to access the Service and create a user “profile” for use as described below.</p>

<p>When you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with your “profile,” which contains the information supplied to us. You will be able to update or correct any of the Personal Information in your profile. As the Service is intended for business purposes only, unless your place of work is also your home, you should only enter business contact information. We use this information to provide the Service and to identify how you'd like to use your account. We use this information because it is necessary to provide you with an account and because we have a legitimate business interest in enabling you to update your preferences and settings online.</p>

<p>Once your Personal Information has been entered into your profile, this information is added to the participant list for each Exchange or Workspace you have been authorized to access. Other participants of your Exchange(s) or Workspace(s) may then have access to your Personal Information. You may receive certain emails relating to your use of the Service, such as email alerts related to Exchanges or Workspaces on which you are a participant and other email communications relating to the Service. Emails will be sent to the email address(es) listed in your profile.</p>

<p>Your Personal Information is also added to Intralinks' global directory of current and former users of the Service (the “GUD”). If you are selected to join another Exchange or Workspace in the future, your user ID will be authorized to access that Exchange, and your Personal Information will be added to the participant list for that Exchange or Workspace. Our clients also have the ability to maintain one or more “business groups,” which are contact lists comprised of all users that have used the Exchanges or Workspaces that they have managed. Your Personal Information may be added to one or more of these business groups.</p>

<p>We use your Personal Information as set forth above to provide, manage and facilitate your use of the Service, whether now or in the future. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in performing the contract that we have entered into with your employer, or with the affiliate or partner of your employer (as applicable). We will keep this information for as long as you remain an Intralinks account holder.</p>

<p><em><strong>Reports and Analytics</strong></em></p>

<p>As a function of the Service and in order to conduct internal analysis of use of the Service, Intralinks also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service (e.g. access to Exchanges, Workspaces and documents, including time, date and length of access). This includes maintaining a log of users' IP addresses, the websites from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser's settings that may affect Service performance. The information described in this paragraph is referred to as “Usage Log Information.” It may also be combined with Usage Log Information about other users of an Exchange or Workspace you are permissioned into to provide an overall view of how the Exchange or Workspace is used.</p>

<p>Usage Log Information will be recorded and used internally within Intralinks and may also be made available to managers of Exchanges, owners of Workspaces, Service licensees or to your employer or entity on whose behalf you are accessing the Service.</p>

<p>We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in understanding how our Service is accessed, how it is used and whether there are any potential security issues arising from such use. &nbsp;We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that allows us to provide the Service, to perform the contract that we have entered into with your employer, or with the affiliate or partner of your employer (as applicable) and to understand how people use our Service.</p>

<p><em><strong>Support</strong></em></p>

<p>We share Usage Log Information, as well as information about your browser and other local computer settings, with Exchange managers and Workspace owners in order to troubleshoot or avoid potential access problems. We also use this information (in addition to your contact information) to contact you in relation to providing you with support, including where you have already contacted us via telephone, email or our "Chat with Us" function. Where necessary, we disclose this information to trusted support providers (such as RightNow (Oracle)) who will undertake this role on our behalf.</p>

<p>We need this information to provide you with support requested. We use and disclose this information to provide the Service and provide relevant support services. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in ensuring that you receive an effective Service from us. We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand any technical issues that users have with our Service.</p>

<p><em><strong>Exchange Managers and Workspace Owners</strong></em></p>

<p>If you have been designated by your organisation as an Exchange manager or Workspace owner, we will use your Personal Information when we are undertaking work on behalf of your organisation, for example adding participants for the first time to an Exchange or Workspace. We use your Personal Information because it is necessary for our contract with your organisation that we interact with you in order to comply with your organisation's instructions. We may also notify you when the Exchange is about to be suspended, in the event where your organisation has an overdue balance and we have not been able to reach out to, or get a response from, your organisation’s billing department. We will keep this information for as long as your organisation has a relationship with us.</p>

<p><em><strong>Marketing</strong></em></p>

<p>If you are a user of the Service and we have a permission to send you marketing messages, we will use your Personal Information to contact you about our services and products. We will contact you either by email or phone. We also use Usage Log Information to better tailor these communications to you by identifying those features and aspects of our services that are most relevant to you based on your historic usage.</p>

<p>You may decline to receive mail or email from us by selecting the opt-out link which will be contained in any such email that you receive, or by contacting us using the details at <a href="/privacy#5">How can I change, update or delete my contact information or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?</a></p>

<p><em><strong>Sale or Merger of Intralinks</strong></em></p>

<p>Subject to applicable law, as the GUD is a business asset of Intralinks, if Intralinks were sold to or merged with another company, the GUD (which includes your Personal Information) may be transferred to a successor of the company, or to a subsidiary or affiliate of Intralinks, who will agree to abide by the terms of this Privacy Notice. You have the right to request that your Personal Information be removed from the GUD at any time (see below).</p>

<p><em><strong>Legal Requirements</strong></em></p>

<p>We will also disclose personal information (1) in response to lawful requests by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements) and, where applicable, in accordance with our internal policy on access by government or regulatory authorities and (2) in our sole discretion if we believe that such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government or regulatory investigation or in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intralinks may also process your Personal Information if necessary in the defence of a legal claim. We will not delete Personal Information if relevant to an investigation or a dispute. It will continue to be stored until those issues are fully resolved.</p>

<h2 id="2b">What information could Intralinks otherwise collect about me?</h2>

<p><em><strong>Billing</strong></em></p>

<p>If you have been designated by your organisation as being a contact for billing or payment purposes, we will use your Personal Information to process your organisation's order, issue invoices to your organisation and take payment from, or make payment to, you (including refunds if applicable). We use this information because it is necessary for our contract with your organisation that we collect information from its representatives to process payments or give or receive refunds. We will keep information relating to payments for the length of the contract between us and for ten (10) years afterwards.</p>

<p><em><strong>Reviews and Feedback</strong></em></p>

<p>If you are a user of an Exchange or Workspace and you contact Intralinks to provide feedback or reviews of your experience, we will use your Personal Information (as well as your feedback/review) to understand and respond to customer feedback. We use this information because we have a legitimate business interest in understanding customer feedback and in responding to your communications in a consistent way. We will keep this information for a reasonable length of time that lets us understand and assess people’s experience of our Service.</p>

<h2 id="3">How does Intralinks protect the security of my Personal Information?</h2>

<p>Intralinks has implemented and currently maintains an effective written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards and other security measures necessary to (a) ensure the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your Personal Information; (b) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your Personal Information; (c) protect against unauthorized access to, destruction, modification, disclosure or use of your Personal Information; and (d) detect and respond to security incidents involving your Personal Information. We permit persons working for us to access and use your Personal Information only to serve our legitimate business and our customers’ service needs, in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Notice, Intralinks will disclose your Personal Information (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, exchange rule, other legal process or where Intralinks is otherwise required to do so in accordance with locally applicable law and where applicable, our internal policy on access by government or regulatory authorities; and (2) in its sole discretion if it believes such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government or regulatory investigation, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.</p>

<h2 id="4">What about transfer of my Personal Information to other countries?</h2>

<p>Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, including to countries outside of the location(s) of your business, such as the United States and countries within Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. Where such transfers of your Personal Information are made they will be made in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<p><em><strong>Transfer of Information to Other Countries – Users in European Economic Area (EEA)</strong></em></p>

<p>We store your Personal Information on cloud servers located in the United States. In addition, we use suppliers in the United States that support the provision of our Service. The transfer of this information is governed by a contract including standard contractual clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission.</p>

<p>Where our U.S. affiliates process information about EEA users, the transfer of this information is governed by SCCs approved by the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Customer Support team may, depending on the time that support is requested by a user, be provided by personnel located in our affiliates' offices outside the EEA or by third-party contractors located in the Philippines (IntegrityNet). The transfer to our affiliates and third-party subcontractors is governed by SCCs approved by the European Commission.</p>

<h2 id="5">How can I change, update or delete my Personal Information, or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?</h2>

<p>Under the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), as amended, including the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 (collectively “Aus PA”)), you (if you are an Australian resident) may have certain privacy rights in connection with your Personal Information (as such term is described in the Aus PA). &nbsp;Some of those rights and disclosure requirements are already outlined in the various Sections above. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Collection of Information</strong></p>

<p>We collect the personal information categories outlined below, which we may disclose to other legal entities within SS&amp;C, third party service providers who host our website or other information technology systems or otherwise hold or process your information on our behalf, under substantially similar conditions of confidentiality and security, and business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for our operational business purposes:</p>

<ul><li>Identifiers, such as name, contact information, date of birth, gender, tax file number, financial details, online identifiers and any other required information to maintain a super fund’s records in a format that identifies the member. These records are essential to the proper management of a superannuation fund (Fund) and to enable the Fund to provide members with superannuation benefits and may be provided by the Fund to us.</li>
	<li>Personal information, as defined in the Aus PA.</li>
	<li>We might also collect health information on behalf of our clients to enable death or disability insurance cover from the Fund’s insurer or to process a member’s disability claim. Information about a member’s potential beneficiaries is also held by us or our client.</li>
	<li>Professional or employment-related information, such as company name.</li>
</ul><p>Depending on how you choose to interact with us, we may collect your personal information when you contact us by telephone, email, through our website or when you complete an application form.</p>

<p>We do not share or sell your personal information with third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing practices; nor do we sell personal information (as contemplated by the Aus PA) about you that you have provided to us or that we may have collected.</p>

<p>If you are an Australian resident, you have the following rights as set forth in the Aus PA:</p>

<p><strong>Access to and Correction of Personal Information.</strong></p>

<ol><li>
	<p>You can <strong>access your own personal information</strong> by contacting us. Requests for access to your personal information will be responded to within a reasonable period after the request is made. Access to your personal information will be given in the manner requested by you, if it is reasonable and practical to do so. A fee for providing the requested access may apply.</p>

	<p>There are some circumstances in which we are entitled to deny you access to your personal information. These include circumstances where such personal information is used in confidential decisions or in a commercially sensitive decision-making process, where the privacy of others may be breached if the personal information was accessed or where the law requires or authorizes such access to be denied.</p>

	<p>If access to requested information is refused or not provided in the manner requested, or there is a refusal to correct the information, then written notice will be provided setting out reasons for the refusal and mechanisms available to complain about the refusal.</p>
	</li>
	<li>If we are holding personal information in relation to you that is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading or you <strong>request to correct</strong> the information, we will take reasonable action to correct the information to ensure that, having regard to the purpose for which it is held, the information is accurate, up to date, complete, relevant and not misleading.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Transfer of Personal Information Overseas</strong></p>

<p>In certain situations, personal information that we collect may be disclosed to other legal entities within SS&amp;C, third party service providers that operate overseas. This may include India and the United Kingdom that may lead to personal information disclosed to overseas recipients.</p>

<p>Before disclosing personal information overseas, reasonable steps will be taken to ensure the recipient does not breach the Aus PA or the effect is that the information will be protected in at least a substantially similar way in which the Aus PA protect the personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Notifiable Privacy Data Breaches</strong></p>

<p>A data breach happens when personal information is accessed or disclosed without authorization or is lost. Where we assess that we have reasonable grounds to believe that an eligible data breach has occurred, we will notify you and the Australian Information Commissioner about the breach when a data breach involving personal information is likely to result in serious harm.</p>

<p><strong>How do you Contact Us regarding your rights under the Aus PA?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Types of personal data collected and purposes for collection and use&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Intralinks processes certain personal data it receives from the EEA for two purposes: (1) firstly it processes certain personal data on its own behalf for its internal business purposes; and (2) it also processes certain personal data it receives from the EEA on behalf of its customers.

<p><em>Disclosures in response to lawful requests by public authorities</em></p>

<p>Intralinks may also disclose personal data (1) in response to lawful requests by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements) and, where applicable, in accordance with our internal policy on access by government or regulatory authorities and (2) in our sole discretion if we believe that such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government or regulatory investigation or in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Choice</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Data integrity and purpose limitation&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>When Intralinks is acting as a data processor, Intralinks will process personal data in compliance with the instructions of its customers, who act as data controllers in respect of such data and will be responsible for ensuring that the personal data is appropriate and only processed for limited purposes. In addition, when its provision of services to a customer ceases, Intralinks will, as agreed with the customer, comply with Intralinks' policy for the secure deletion of personal data processed on behalf of that customer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have certain rights under the Principles to access personal data about you that Intralinks processes as a data controller. To access such personal information please submit such request by clicking the Individual Rights Manager <a href="https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/cd7580aa-690a-4ec2-962e-4f3e16911867">button</a>, and filling out the form. We will respond to your request in accordance with the Principles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where Intralinks is acting as a data processor, we will pass each request that we receive from an individual to access, correct, amend or delete personal data relating to them&nbsp;(<strong>Request</strong>) to the relevant data controller and will not respond to the Request itself. Intralinks, to the extent instructed by a data controller and in accordance with its customer agreements and applicable law, will assist a customer in complying with Requests by providing relevant information and support to the relevant customer to enable it to comply with the Request.&nbsp;</p>
