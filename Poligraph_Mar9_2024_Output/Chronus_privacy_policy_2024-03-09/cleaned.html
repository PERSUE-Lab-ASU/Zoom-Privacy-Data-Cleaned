<li><strong> SECURITY&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, whether in transmission or storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, information at rest is protected using AES 256 encryption and we employ controlled interfaces (such as proxies, gateways, routers, firewall, and encrypted tunnels) as well as a variety of additional security controls (e.g., intrusion detection systems, data encryption). All communications within the Chronus Mentor Service are secured via a high-grade 256-bit SSL encryption.</p>
<p>Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of your personal information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure.</p>
<ol id="data-retention" class="margin-l-20 margin-t-15" start="9">
<li><strong> DATA RETENTION.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We will retain your personal information in accordance with applicable law and, unless otherwise provided by applicable law, for no longer than necessary to provide the Services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and in furtherance of our other business purposes outlined hereunder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because these needs can vary for different types and uses of personal information, actual retention periods can vary based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of your personal information, the availability of automated controls that enable you to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where there are technical limitations that otherwise prevent the deletion or anonymization of your personal information, we will safeguard and limit the use of your personal information as required by applicable law.</p>
<ol class="margin-l-20 margin-t-15" start="10">
<li><strong>PUBLIC FORUMS.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Services may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to you. By submitting such information, you acknowledge that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information.</p>
<ol class="margin-l-20 margin-t-15" start="11">
<li><strong>CHILDREN.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Services are not intended for or directed at children and we do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age through the Services. If we learn that we have collected information from children under 13, we will promptly take steps to delete such information.</p>
