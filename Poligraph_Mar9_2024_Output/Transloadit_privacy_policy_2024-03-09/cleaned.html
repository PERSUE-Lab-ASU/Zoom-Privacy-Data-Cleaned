      <p class="lead">In order to provide this service, we capture and store information about you and about users
uploading material to the service:</p>
<p class="lead">As of 25 May 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has come into force. We
wrote this post to outline what Transloadit - and our customers - can do to make sure the new rules
are being followed.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-responsible-for-data-protection">Who is responsible for data protection?</h2>
<p>Since we are a small company, we do not have an external data officer. Responsible for data
protection are our founders Tim Koschützki and Kevin van Zonneveld. You can reach them at
<a href="mailto:founders@transloadit.com">founders@transloadit.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-data-is-collected">What data is collected?</h2>
<p>Transloadit collects and shares information about its customers. Since Transloadit is a B2B service,
this concerns data on businesses. We also receive a limited amount of data on our customers'
customers. These are the individuals or 'data subjects' that the GDPR specifically aims to protect,
and they come in contact with Transloadit when we handle their uploads or when they request the
status of encoding progress of their files.</p>
<p>As far as these cases are concerned, Transloadit receives the following <strong>data</strong> on end-users:</p>
<h3 id="from-the-website">From the website</h3>
<ol>
<li>IP addresses</li>
<li>Request headers</li>
<li>Data entered on our website</li>
<li>The browser session (identified through a cookie)</li>
<li>Information used to analyze usage of our platform via self-hosted, GDPR compliant, anonymized
analytics</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="from-the-api">From the API</h3>
<ol>
<li>IP addresses</li>
<li>Request headers</li>
<li>Your user agent (browser, device, etc.)</li>
<li>Data submitted to our API (media files, uploads)</li>
</ol>
<p>All data stored by us is only used for internal processing, and never sold or otherwise given away.</p>
<p>Since Transloadit does not store data on data subjects, migration or deletion tools are not
applicable.</p>
<h3 id="what-data-is-stored-exactly">What data is stored exactly?</h3>
<p>Transloadit only stores links to uploaded media files in the status JSON of an <dfn>Assembly</dfn>.
We do not store any other data coming from data subjects.</p>
<h2 id="storing-media-files">Storing media files</h2>
<p>Transloadit only stores temporary files, and we do
<a href="/docs/faq/temporary-purge-sooner/">so for <strong>24 hours</strong></a>. Files are hashed and
anonymized.</p>
<p>Transloadit employees only look at your files to troubleshoot problems. This rarely happens, and
when it does, we do so with the understanding that anything we see is to be kept strictly
confidential.</p>
<p>Any Transloadit employee or subcontractor with access to these systems will have signed an NDA,
which among other things, includes enforcing two-factor authentication for critical services,
encrypted drives, and password managers.</p>
<p>If it is important to you that the media files of your end-users, kept during the 24-hour window,
temporarily resides in a particular region, Transloadit currently operates in the regions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>us-east-1</code> (Virginia, USA)</li>
<li><code>eu-west-1</code> (Ireland)</li>
<li><code>ap-southeast-1</code> (Singapore)</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the endpoint <code>https://api2.transloadit.com/</code> is used, Transloadit will serve your users
from the region closest to them, but you can also opt to exclusively address one region, by using an
endpoint like <code>https://api2-eu-west-1.transloadit.com/</code>. In this case, no data for the request
leaves this region.</p>
<h2 id="storing-assemblies">Storing Assemblies</h2>
<p><dfn>Assemblies</dfn> contain links to the media files that have been uploaded by data subjects. If
the links point to files temporarily hosted by us, then these links will expire after 24 hours (at
the point when the associated files are discarded). Links to files that were exported to your own
storage system (Amazon S3, FTP server, Rackspace container, etc.) will expire based on the expiry
policy you set forth on these containers.</p>
<p><dfn>Assemblies</dfn> will be archived after three months following their creation. Any
<dfn>Assembly Status</dfn> JSON will cease to be available through
https://api2.transloadit.com/assemblies/[[assembly_id]] after three months, along with all links to
media files uploaded for this <dfn>Assembly</dfn>. Assembly IDs are secure: only the data subject,
you as our customer and Transloadit staff know these Assembly IDs.</p>
<h2 id="third-party-services">Third-party services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services which also store data about you. Third party customer data
counts as personal data about you.</p>
