Since Transloadit is a B2B service,\nthis concerns data on businesses. We also receive a limited amount of data on our customers'\ncustomers. These are the individuals or 'data subjects' that the GDPR specifically aims to protect,\nand they come in contact with Transloadit when we handle their uploads or when they request the\nstatus of encoding progress of their files.</p>\n<p>As far as these cases are concerned, Transloadit receives the following <strong>data</strong> on end-users:</p>\n<h3 id=\"from-the-website\">From the website</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>IP addresses</li>\n<li>Request headers</li>\n<li>Data entered on our website</li>\n<li>The browser session (identified through a cookie)</li>\n<li>Information used to analyze usage of our platform via self-hosted, GDPR compliant, anonymized\nanalytics</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"from-the-api\">From the API</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>IP addresses</li>\n<li>Request headers</li>\n<li>Your user agent (browser, device, etc.)</li>\n<li>Data submitted to our API (media files, uploads)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All data stored by us is only used for internal processing, and never sold or otherwise given away.</p>\n<p>Since Transloadit does not store data on data subjects, migration or deletion tools are not\napplicable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-data-is-stored-exactly\">What data is stored exactly?</h3>\n<p>Transloadit only stores links to uploaded media files in the status JSON of an <dfn>Assembly</dfn>.\nWe do not store any other data coming from data subjects.</p>\n\n<p>Transloadit only stores temporary files, and we do\n<a href=\"file:///docs/faq/temporary-purge-sooner/\">so for <strong>24 hours</strong></a>.
