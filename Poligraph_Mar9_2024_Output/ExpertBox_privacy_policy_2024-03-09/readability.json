This includes appointment management and booking, execution of video calls as well as payment and invoicing. Visitors (\"visitors\") as well as customers (\"customers\") of the service Providers (\"experts\") thus have the opportunity to book appointments with experts online and to process them using ExpertBox's software solution.\n</p>\n<p>\n2.2 In addition to the ExpertBox website and app, the software solution is also available via integration\non websites of experts and on existing platforms.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>\nData retention\n</h3>\n<p>\nWhen you access ExpertBox services as a visitor, even without logging in or logging in, server log files\nare sent from your server to ExpertBox's web server, which is technically necessary for accessing\ninformation. The following data is collected as part of the server log files:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nIP address\n</li>\n<li>\nThe content of ExpertBox you have requested\n</li>\n<li>\nThe previously visited website that referred to the ExpertBox application\n</li>\n<li>\nBrowser type and browser version\n</li>\n<li>\nScreen resolution\n</li>\n<li>\nTransmitted amount of data\n</li>\n<li>\nMessage about successful call\n</li>\n<li>\nOperating system used\n</li>\n<li>\nEnd device used\n</li>\n<li>\nDate and time of the server request\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThis data can not be assigned to specific persons for ExpertBox and a merger of this data with other data sources will not be made. ExpertBox has no influence on the automatic transmission of this data. However, you can set this automatic data transfer directly in your device or browser and restrict it if necessary. The o.g. Server log files are stored for 12 days, after which all collected IP addresses are anonymized and used only for quality assurance, web site optimization and statistical purposes. We retain your information for as long as needed for our functions or activities or to comply with our legal obligations (such as reporting to regulatory authorities), to resolve disputes and to enforce our rights. We also may retain your information to support our business operations and develop our Services. The criteria used to determine our data retention periods include: (i) how long the personal data is needed to provide the services and operate the business; (ii) the type of personal data collected; and (iii) whether we are subject to a legal, contractual or similar obligation to retain the data (e.g., mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation or disputes.) When we no longer need to use your information, we will take steps to properly anonymize or destroy it. We may retain information that is not personally identified to an individual User, including without limitation anonymized data and aggregate information, at our discretion.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnder certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal\ndata. You have the right to:\n</p>\n<div><p>\nRequest access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we\nhold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n<br>\nRequest correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms.\n</p><p>\n\nRequest restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data`s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n</p><p>\n\nRequest the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data. Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\n</p><p>\n\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\n</p></div>\n<p>\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within 45 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than 45\ndays if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will\nnotify you and keep you updated. Maximum response time 90 days.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo exercise your rights, please contact us at\n<a target=\"blank\" href=\"mailto:info@expertbox.io\">info@expertbox.io\n</a></p>\n<p>\nThe Company works only with individuals who are at least 18 years old.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>\nUse of cookies\n</h3>\n<p>\nThis website uses cookies to better the user experience of its visitors.

The following data is collected as part of the server log files:\n\n\n\nIP address\n\n\nThe content of ExpertBox you have requested\n\n\nThe previously visited website that referred to the ExpertBox application\n\n\nBrowser type and browser version\n\n\nScreen resolution\n\n\nTransmitted amount of data\n\n\nMessage about successful call\n\n\nOperating system used\n\n\nEnd device used\n\n\nDate and time of the server request\n\n\n\nThis data can not be assigned to specific persons for ExpertBox and a merger of this data with other data sources will not be made. ExpertBox has no influence on the automatic transmission of this data. However, you can set this automatic data transfer directly in your device or browser and restrict it if necessary. The o.g. Server log files are stored for 12 days, after which all collected IP addresses are anonymized and used only for quality assurance, web site optimization and statistical purposes. We retain your information for as long as needed for our functions or activities or to comply with our legal obligations (such as reporting to regulatory authorities), to resolve disputes and to enforce our rights. We also may retain your information to support our business operations and develop our Services. The criteria used to determine our data retention periods include: (i) how long the personal data is needed to provide the services and operate the business; (ii) the type of personal data collected; and (iii) whether we are subject to a legal, contractual or similar obligation to retain the data (e.g., mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation or disputes.) When we no longer need to use your information, we will take steps to properly anonymize or destroy it. We may retain information that is not personally identified to an individual User, including without limitation anonymized data and aggregate information, at our discretion.\n\n\nUnder certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal\ndata. You have the right to:\n\n\nRequest access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we\nhold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n\nRequest correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms.\n\n\nRequest restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data`s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\n\nRequest the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data. Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\n\n\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\n\n\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within 45 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than 45\ndays if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will\nnotify you and keep you updated. Maximum response time 90 days.\n\n\nTo exercise your rights, please contact us at\ninfo@expertbox.io\n\n\nThe Company works only with individuals who are at least 18 years old.\n\n\n\n\nUse of cookies\n\n\nThis website uses cookies to better the user experience of its visitors.
