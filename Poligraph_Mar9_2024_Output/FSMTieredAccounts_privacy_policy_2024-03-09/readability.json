Where legally required, we will inform you about the use of such tracking technologies using so-called cookie-banners and/or obtain your consent to use such Tracking Technology.</p>\n\n\t<ul><li><strong>How do these Tracking Technologies work?</strong> Cookies are pieces of code that allow for personalization of the Services experience by saving your personal information such as user ID and other preferences. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device's hard disk (such as your computer or smartphone) for record-keeping purposes. Cookies store certain settings and data for exchange with our system via your browser. A cookie usually contains the name of the domain from which the cookie has been placed, as well as information about the age of the cookie and a random alphanumeric identifier, the so-called cookie-ID. They help to recognize the device and make any pre-settings immediately available. Web beacons are small graphical images that may be included on our Sites and typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behaviour. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. Flash cookies are pieces of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user's computer or device. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity often use flash cookies.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>What information do these Tracking Technologies collect?</strong> These tracking technologies collect information about your browser and online usage patterns (e.g., IP address, pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Services such as opening an email, log files, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, etc.), and information about the device(s) you use to access the Services (e.g., unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (IDFA), Google AdID or Windows Advertising ID), device type, model and manufacturer, operating system brand and model and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data). We, or our third party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising and content displayed on another device so that we may recognize and contact you on the various devices you may use.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>What are Cookies and other Tracking Technologies used for?</strong> Tracking Technologies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how our Websites are being used, helping us analyse trends, administering the Websites, tracking users\u2019 movements around the Websites, gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience. Tracking Technology can also help ensure that you see marketing content that is more relevant to you and your interests. Therefore, generally speaking, we use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website(s); (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c)&nbsp;recognize and contact you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage and demographic patterns on our Websites; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise plan for and enhance our Services.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>What types of cookies are used by Flexera?</strong> The types of cookies used on our site can generally be put into one of the following categories: Necessary; functional and advertising. You can find out more about each of the cookie categories in the table below.\n\t\t<ul><li><strong>Necessary Cookies.</strong> These cookies are essential to make our Websites work. They enable you to move around the Websites and use their features. Without these cookies, services that are <strong>necessary</strong> for you to fully use our Websites may not be available, such as accessing certain areas of the Websites.</li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Functional Cookies.</strong> These cookies allow us to recognize you and tailor our Websites to provide enhanced features and content to you. For example, these cookies can be used to remember your IP address, language choice, country selection and requested Services.</li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Advertising Cookies.</strong> These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and may track you on other websites. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertising partners.</li>\n\t\t</ul></li>\n\t\t<li><strong>How long will cookies stay on your browsing device?</strong> The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing the website that has set the cookie. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device after you have finished browsing a particular website, until they are deleted or until they expire. The actual period of validity of each persistent cookie depends on each cookie. However, they generally expire within 3 months. You can amend your cookie settings using your internet browser\u2019s settings.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Cookies by third parties.</strong> Some cookies belong to us, and we place them on your device. Other cookies are placed on your browsing device by third parties when you visit our Websites. Third parties setting cookies from our Websites will be providing a service to us or a function of the website, but we do not always control how third-party cookies are used. Some third parties may use advertising cookies to help gather information about your browsing activity so that they can deliver website advertising to you that is relevant to your interests.

To do this, we or our advertising partners may collect information about how you use or connect to our Services, or the types of other websites, social media services, content and ads that you (or others using your device) visit or view or connect to our Services.

You can also avoid Tracking Technology by not consenting to the use of Tracking Technology when asked for consent in cookie banners. Please check your browser and browser settings to determine where cookies are stored and whether and how they may be deleted. The help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable most cookies altogether. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all Tracking Technologies. Please note that in the case you delete existing cookies, your chosen pre-settings will be deleted as well. This means that the next time you access our website, we may ask for your consent again (to the extent required by law) and set new cookies. The period of validity of those cookies will then start from the beginning. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.

Where legally required, we will inform you about the use of such tracking technologies using so-called cookie-banners and/or obtain your consent to use such Tracking Technology.\n\n\tHow do these Tracking Technologies work? Cookies are pieces of code that allow for personalization of the Services experience by saving your personal information such as user ID and other preferences. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device's hard disk (such as your computer or smartphone) for record-keeping purposes. Cookies store certain settings and data for exchange with our system via your browser. A cookie usually contains the name of the domain from which the cookie has been placed, as well as information about the age of the cookie and a random alphanumeric identifier, the so-called cookie-ID. They help to recognize the device and make any pre-settings immediately available. Web beacons are small graphical images that may be included on our Sites and typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behaviour. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

These tracking technologies collect information about your browser and online usage patterns (e.g., IP address, pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Services such as opening an email, log files, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, etc.), and information about the device(s) you use to access the Services (e.g., unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (IDFA), Google AdID or Windows Advertising ID), device type, model and manufacturer, operating system brand and model and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data). We, or our third party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising and content displayed on another device so that we may recognize and contact you on the various devices you may use.\n\t\tWhat are Cookies and other Tracking Technologies used for? Tracking Technologies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how our Websites are being used, helping us analyse trends, administering the Websites, tracking users\u2019 movements around the Websites, gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience. Tracking Technology can also help ensure that you see marketing content that is more relevant to you and your interests. Therefore, generally speaking, we use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website(s); (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c)\u00a0recognize and contact you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage and demographic patterns on our Websites; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise plan for and enhance our Services.\n\t\tWhat types of cookies are used by Flexera?

This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertising partners.\n\t\t\n\t\tHow long will cookies stay on your browsing device? The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing the website that has set the cookie. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device after you have finished browsing a particular website, until they are deleted or until they expire. The actual period of validity of each persistent cookie depends on each cookie. However, they generally expire within 3 months. You can amend your cookie settings using your internet browser\u2019s settings.\n\t\tCookies by third parties. Some cookies belong to us, and we place them on your device. Other cookies are placed on your browsing device by third parties when you visit our Websites. Third parties setting cookies from our Websites will be providing a service to us or a function of the website, but we do not always control how third-party cookies are used. Some third parties may use advertising cookies to help gather information about your browsing activity so that they can deliver website advertising to you that is relevant to your interests.

Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all Tracking Technologies. Please note that in the case you delete existing cookies, your chosen pre-settings will be deleted as well. This means that the next time you access our website, we may ask for your consent again (to the extent required by law) and set new cookies.
