<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for using MeetingScience! You’ve probably read a dozen of these privacy policy statements, or at least the first paragraph, before. We’ve tried to use plain-spoken language throughout this policy so that it’s easy for you to understand how we collect, use, and protect your information when you access our website(s), products, services and applications (collectively, the “Services”) which we will describe below. We care about your privacy and know that we’re not here to do anything that would break the trust that you’ve placed in our Services. </span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information in order to make our Services available to you, to contact you, and to better understand how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at </span><a href="mailto:privacy@meetingscience.io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy@meetingscience.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Will MeetingScience ever change this Privacy Policy?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on our Website, and/or by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Your use of the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted will be considered to indicate your acceptance of the changes.</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What information does MeetingScience collect?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information You Provide to Us</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. When you create a new account to use the Services we will solicit your consent to connect your Google account and/or Microsoft Office 365 and/or Microsoft Exchange and/or Slack account to your new MeetingScience account, thereby providing us with access to your account, including but not limited to your Calendar and your Contacts. Although the authentication provides broad access to your account, MeetingScience accesses and stores a subset of data from your account, including name, email address, calendar content, contacts, and company domain directory, to provide you with our Services. For instance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you rate a meeting using the Services we collect the meeting attendees’ name and email address so that we can display that information in the rating invites, and store it to enable some of the Services and for debugging purposes. MeetingScience collects the recipient’s activities with regard to the rating invite.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In keeping with standard online privacy practices, users should not include any highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, financial information, or “protected health information” (as that term is defined by the Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act – HIPAA for short)) in any meeting or meeting invite so that such data does not transfer to our servers (even if only temporarily). We do not knowingly collect or read information regarding meetings marked Private in your calendar, other than the Name, Time, and location of such a meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we collect Personal Information you submit to us, for example by completing a form on </span><a href="https://meetingscience.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://meetingscience.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In that case, we may communicate with you, for example by calling you at the phone number you provide, sending you promotional email offers, or emailing you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps enhance our engagement with you and generally improve our Services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optout@meetingscience.io</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Collected Automatically</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns, and generally to improve the Services.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity while you are using the Services. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third Party Analytics Services</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use third party analytics services in order to better understand user engagement with the Services. When a user browses or uses the Services, these third party analytics services may collect the user’s IP address, browser type, and approximate location (based on the IP address). They may also use web logs or web beacons and may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In order to refine our understanding of user engagement, we provide these Services with a user’s name and email address (which we collected as part of the user’s account registration process).</span></p></div>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Does MeetingScience share personal information?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Agents and vendors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them, including in some cases the Personal Information you have provided to us, in order to make the Services available to you. For example, we may use third party hosting providers or software developers to help implement and maintain the Services. However, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Business Transfers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Protection of MeetingScience and Others:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our applicable terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of MeetingScience, our employees, our users, or others.</span></li>

				<h3 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Is personal information about me secure?</h3>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will use very diligent efforts to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.&nbsp;We store passwords with md5 encryption and not in plaintext. We do not knowingly collect physical addresses.</span></p></div>

Your information will be stored and processed in the United States or other countries where we decide to maintain datacenter facilities in the future. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of information outside of your country, even if your country has more rigorous data protection standards. For any Personal Information that may be transferred from the European Economic Area, please see the EU Residents section below.</span></p></div>
