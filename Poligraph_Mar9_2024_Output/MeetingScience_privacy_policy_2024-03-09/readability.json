When you create a new account to use the Services we will solicit your consent to connect your Google account and/or Microsoft Office 365 and/or Microsoft Exchange and/or Slack account to your new MeetingScience account, thereby providing us with access to your account, including but not limited to your Calendar and your Contacts. Although the authentication provides broad access to your account, MeetingScience accesses and stores a subset of data from your account, including name, email address, calendar content, contacts, and company domain directory, to provide you with our Services. For instance:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>When you rate a meeting using the Services we collect the meeting attendees\u2019 name and email address so that we can display that information in the rating invites, and store it to enable some of the Services and for debugging purposes.

We do not knowingly collect or read information regarding meetings marked Private in your calendar, other than the Name, Time, and location of such a meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition, we collect Personal Information you submit to us, for example by completing a form on </span><a href=\"https://meetingscience.io/\"><span>https://meetingscience.io</span></a><span>. In that case, we may communicate with you, for example by calling you at the phone number you provide, sending you promotional email offers, or emailing you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps enhance our engagement with you and generally improve our Services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to </span><span>optout@meetingscience.io</span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4><span>Information Collected Automatically</span></h4>\n<p><span>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, \u201ccookie\u201d information, the type of browser and/or device you\u2019re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. \u201cCookies\u201d are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device\u2019s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns, and generally to improve the Services.</span></p>\n<h4><span>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</span></h4>\n<p><span>Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience. Your browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity while you are using the Services. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked.</span></p>\n<h4><span>Third Party Analytics Services</span></h4>\n<p><span>We use third party analytics services in order to better understand user engagement with the Services. When a user browses or uses the Services, these third party analytics services may collect the user\u2019s IP address, browser type, and approximate location (based on the IP address). They may also use web logs or web beacons and may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In order to refine our understanding of user engagement, we provide these Services with a user\u2019s name and email address (which we collected as part of the user\u2019s account registration process).</span></p></div>\n\t\t\t</div><div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Does MeetingScience share personal information?</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<div><p><span>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone.
