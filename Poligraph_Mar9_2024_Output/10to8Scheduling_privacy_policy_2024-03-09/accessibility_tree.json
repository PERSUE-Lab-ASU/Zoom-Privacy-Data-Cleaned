Notwithstanding the confidentiality obligations under an Agreement, the receiving party is free to make disclosure of any Confidential Information in a judicial, legislative, or administrative investigation or proceeding or to a government or other regulatory agency; provided that, to the extent permitted by the circumstances, the receiving party provides to disclosing party prior written notice of the intended disclosure to enable the disclosing party the reasonable opportunity to contest or limit such disclosure (including reasonable assistance at disclosing party\u2019s expense) or, if prior written notice is not permitted, prompt notice of such disclosure. Each party acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information may cause irreparable injury to the party whose information is disclosed. Therefore, each party is, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information, entitled to seek injunctive relief. This provision shall not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to such party at law or in equity.
