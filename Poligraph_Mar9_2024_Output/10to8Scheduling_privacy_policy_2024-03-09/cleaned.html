<p><strong>1. Processing of data</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.1. Parties’ roles.</strong> As between SIS and the Customer, the Customer is the controller of Customer Personal Data, and SIS shall process Customer Personal Data only as a processor acting on behalf of Customer as described in Annex A (Details of Processing) of this DPA.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.2. Purpose limitation.</strong> SIS shall process Customer Personal Data only in connection with the arrangements envisaged under this DPA and in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions, except where otherwise required by applicable law. Customer instructs SIS and its Sub-processors to process Customer Personal Data as reasonably necessary for the provision of the Products contemplated by the Agreement and to perform its obligations under the Agreement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.3. Description of processing</strong>. A description of the nature and purposes of the Processing, the types of Personal Data, categories of Data Subjects, and the duration of the Processing are set out further in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Annex A</span> of this DPA.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.4. Sensitive data.</strong> The Customer is responsible for ensuring that suitable safeguards are in place prior to transmitting or processing, or prior to permitting Customer’s Uses to transmit or process, any Sensitive Data via the Products. The Customer shall take such additional measures (e.g. relating to security and consent) as are necessary to protect such Sensitive Data in accordance with its obligations under all Applicable Privacy Laws.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.5. Third countries.</strong> To the extent such data is transferred under this DPA to a Third Country, the parties agree to abide by the SCCs, where applicable, for such transfers. In particular, transfers of Personal Data from the European Union, European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“UK”) to Third Countries are subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses, Module Three. The information required for the purposes of the SCCs is provided in Annex C of this DPA. The SCCs are hereby incorporated into the Agreement and the parties’ acceptance of this DPA shall constitute the parties’ acceptance and signing of the Standard Contractual Clauses. If the terms of the Agreement conflict with the SCCs, the terms of the SCCs will prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any data transfer mechanisms are approved under Applicable Privacy Laws the parties may agree to leverage such data transfer mechanisms in lieu of the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.6. Customer compliance.</strong> Customer shall, in its use of the Products, at all times process Personal Data, and provide the Instructions for the processing of Personal Data, in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws. Customer represents and warrants that Customer has obtained or will obtain, all necessary consents, licenses and approvals for the processing of Personal Data under this DPA and, where applicable, has a valid legal basis under Applicable Privacy Laws for the processing of Personal Data under this DPA. If Customer is a Data Processor of Personal Data, Customer represents and warrants that Customer’s instructions and processing of Personal Data, including its appointment of SIS as a sub-processor, have been authorized by the respective Data Controller. Customer further represents and warrants that Customer (i) will comply with all Applicable Privacy Laws in its performance arising out of this DPA; and (ii) has reviewed SIS’s security practices and acknowledges that such practices are appropriately designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing hereunder.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.7. Notification obligations regarding the Customer's instructions.</strong> SIS shall promptly notify the Customer in writing without any obligation to provide legal advice, unless prohibited from doing so under Applicable Privacy Laws, if it becomes aware or believes that any data processing instruction from the Customer violates Applicable Privacy Laws.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Return or Deletion of Data</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.1. </span>Following completion of the Products, SIS shall return or delete the Personal Data as set forth under the Agreement or applicable service documentation, or provide Customer the ability to delete such Personal Data directly through the tools or functionality made available by the Service. The foregoing obligations shall not apply (a) where deletion is not permitted under applicable law (including Applicable Privacy Laws) or the order of a governmental or regulatory body; (b) where SIS retains such Personal Data for internal record keeping and compliance with any legal obligations; and (c) where SIS’s then-current data retention or similar back-up system stores Personal Data provided such data will remain protected in accordance with the measures described in the Agreement and this DPA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Authorized Personnel</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1. </span>SIS shall ensure that all Authorized Personnel are made aware of the confidential nature of Personal Data and have executed confidentiality agreements or are otherwise subject to binding duties of confidentiality that prohibit them from disclosing or otherwise processing any Personal Data except in accordance with the Instructions and their obligations in connection with the Products.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.2. </span>SIS shall take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that Authorized Personnel have received data privacy security and training appropriate to the nature of their processing of Personal Data and the requirements of Applicable Privacy Laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><strong style="background-color: transparent;">SIS Sub-processors</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.1. </span>Customer hereby provides SIS with general written authorization to engage Sub-processors to process (including transfer) Personal Data in connection with the Products in accordance with this Section 4.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.2. </span>A list of SIS’s current Sub-processors (the “<strong>Sub-processor List</strong>”) is available at <a href="https://10to8.com/legal"><span>https://10to8.com/legal</span></a> (such URL may be updated by SIS from time to time upon notice to Customer). These Sub-processors will be deemed authorized by Customer to process Personal Data in connection with this DPA. At least thirty (30) days before enabling any new Sub-processor to access or participate in the processing of Customer Personal Data, SIS will add such Sub-processor to the Sub-processor List and notify Customer of that update. Customer may object to such an engagement on reasonable data protection grounds by providing notice to SIS within ten (10) days of receipt of the aforementioned notice from SIS.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.3. </span>If the Customer has raised a reasonable objection to the new Sub-processor, and the parties have failed to agree on a solution within a reasonable period of time, the Customer shall have the right to terminate the Agreement with a notice period mutually determined by SIS and&nbsp; the Customer, without prejudice to any other remedies available under law or contract. In this event Customer shall immediately pay all fees and costs then owing to SIS up until the date of termination.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.4. </span>If Customer does not object to the engagement of a third party in accordance with Section 4.2, that third party will be deemed an Sub-processor for the purposes of this DPA.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.5. </span>SIS shall ensure that each Sub-processor is subject to obligations regarding the processing of Personal Data that are substantially similar to those which SIS is subject under this DPA.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.6. </span>SIS shall be liable to Customer for any breach of this DPA caused by the acts or omissions of its Sub-processors.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.7. </span>If Customer and SIS have entered into the Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data) the above authorizations will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by SIS of the processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Security of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.1. </span>SIS shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to (i) ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented by the processing of the Personal Data; and (ii) protect the Personal Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. Such technical and organizational measures shall include measures equal to or exceeding the measures set forth in Annex B of this DPA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong><strong>Transfers of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.1. </span>Only to the extent applicable, or if required by SIS to provide the Products, Customer acknowledges and agrees that SIS and its Sub-processors may process (including transfer) Personal Data in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“UK”), the European Economic Area, the United States of America, Canada and in any other location where SIS or its Sub-processors maintains data processing operations, as set forth in the Sub-processor List. SIS will at all times provide an adequate level of protection for the Personal Data, in accordance with the requirements of Applicable Privacy Laws and, to the extent applicable, the requirements below.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.2. </span>In connection with the provision of the Products to Customer, SIS may (and may authorize its Sub-processors to) receive from, process within, or transfer Personal Data to, any Third Country provided that SIS and its Sub-processors take measures to adequately protect such data consistent with Applicable Privacy Laws. Such measures may include to the extent available and applicable under such laws.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.3. </span>The parties’ agreement to enter into and comply with the Standard Contractual Clauses which are hereby incorporated into this DPA and as further set forth in Annex C. In particular, transfers of Personal Data from the European Union, European Economic Area, Switzerland or the UK by Customer to SIS or SIS to Customer in Third Countries are subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses, Module Two (“Controller to Processor”), and Module Three (“Processor to Processor”). The information required for the purposes of the SCCs is provided in Annex C to this DPA. To the extent that any substitute or additional appropriate safeguards or transfer mechanisms under Applicable Privacy Laws are required to transfer data to a Third Country, the parties agree to implement the same as soon as practicable and document such requirements for implementation in an attachment to this DPA.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.4. </span>The Parties acknowledge and agree that they have, taking into account, without limitation, the Personal Data and Third Countries in scope, the relevant security measures under this DPA and the relevant parties participating in the processing of such Personal Data, conducted an assessment of the appropriateness of the relevant transfer mechanism adopted hereunder and have determined that such transfer mechanism is appropriately designed to ensure Personal Data transferred in accordance with this DPA is afforded a level of protection in the destination country that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed under the Applicable Privacy Laws.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Cooperation, Audit and Records Requests</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.1. </span>SIS shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly notify Customer following the receipt and verification of a Data Subject Request or shall otherwise advise the Data Subject to submit their Data Subject Request to Customer directly. In either case, Customer will be responsible for responding to such a request.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.2. </span>At the request of Customer and taking into account the nature of the processing applicable to any Data Subject Request, SIS shall apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to enable Customer to comply with Customer’s obligation to respond to such Data Subject Request and/or in demonstrating such compliance provided that (i) Customer is itself unable to respond or fulfill the request without SIS’s assistance and (ii) SIS is able to do so in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by SIS.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.3. </span>If SIS receives a subpoena, court order, warrant or other legal demand from a third party, law enforcement, foreign government, or any other public or judicial authorities seeking the disclosure of Personal Data, SIS shall, legally permitting, promptly notify Customer in writing of such request. SIS shall only comply with such third-party requests where SIS has determined it is legally required to do so, in which case SIS shall provide reasonable cooperation to Customer, at Customer’s expense, if Customer wishes to limit, challenge or protect against such disclosure, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. Customer shall assume all risk and liability in handling and responding to such third-party requests and shall indemnify SIS for all losses, costs, damages, claims, actions, suits, demands and liabilities suffered or incurred by or brought against SIS arising out of or relating to any third-party access requests.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.4. </span>SIS shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to SIS provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance for Customer to comply with its obligations under the Applicable Privacy Laws, including any obligations to conduct a data protection impact assessment, respond to any inquiry from or consult with any Supervisory Authority or demonstrate compliance with Applicable Privacy Law. The obligations hereunder shall only apply where required of SIS by Applicable Privacy Law and provided that Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information or functionality being requested. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by SIS.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.5. </span>Upon Customer’s request and no more than once per calendar year, SIS shall make available for Customer’s review copies of all applicable attestation reports or certifications demonstrating SIS’s compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws as they relate to SIS’s processing of the Customer Personal Data hereunder. Solely where and to the extent (i) required by Applicable Privacy Laws and (ii) such copies of the attestation reports or&nbsp; certifications are insufficient to demonstrate SIS’s compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws as it relates to SIS’s processing of the Personal Data hereunder, SIS shall make available to the Customer additional information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with such obligations and allow for and contribute to audits, including mutually agreed and managed inspections, of those data processing facilities within SIS’s control conducted by the Customer or another auditor mutually agreed upon by SIS and the Customer.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.6. </span>Any audit or inspection authorized by Section 7.5 will occur only after the Customer has provided SIS with at least 30 days’ prior written notice and during a mutually agreed upon date, time, and location by SIS and the Customer. Audits must not unreasonably interfere with SIS’s business or operations, and the scope of such audit will be subject to SIS’s reasonable pre-approval. Individuals responsible for conducting such an audit shall be subject to a contract of confidentiality with SIS. The work required by SIS to participate in any audit may result in additional fees (at a mutually agreed upon hourly rate) to be paid by the Customer, unless otherwise agreed in writing prior to the commencement of such audit. To ensure that SIS complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and its contractual obligations regarding data privacy and security, Customer agrees that SIS is not required to provide Customer with access to SIS’s systems or information in a manner that may compromise the security, privacy, or confidentiality of SIS’s other customers’ confidential or proprietary information.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.7. </span>Any information disclosed pursuant to this Section 7 will be deemed SIS’s Confidential Information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: transparent;">8. Personal Data Breach</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.1. </span>After becoming aware of a positively identified Personal Data Breach, SIS shall, without undue delay (but no later than 72 hours), inform Customer of the Personal Data Breach and take such steps as SIS, in its sole discretion, deems necessary and reasonable to remediate such Personal Data Breach (to the extent that remediation is within SIS’s reasonable control).<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.2. </span>SIS shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information reasonably available to SIS: (a) provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations under Applicable Privacy Laws with respect to notifying relevant regulators and/or Data Subjects affected by such Personal Data Breach; and (b) provide Customer with information in SIS’s reasonable control concerning the details of the Personal Data Breach including, as applicable, the nature of the Personal Data Breach, the categories and approximate numbers of Data Subjects and Personal Data records concerned, and the likely consequences of the Personal Data Breach.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.3. </span>The obligations described in this Section 8 shall not apply in the event that a Personal Data Breach results from the actions or omissions of Customer. In no event will SIS’s cooperation or obligation to report or respond to a Personal Data Breach under this Section be construed as an acknowledgement by SIS of any fault or liability with respect to the Personal Data Breach.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.4.</span>Unless prohibited by an applicable statute or court order, Customer will notify SIS of any third-party legal process relating to any Personal Data Breach, including, but not limited to, any legal process initiated by any governmental entity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. Miscellaneous&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.1. </span>All notices to Customer under this DPA shall be sent by email and directed to the Customer’s designated system administrator for the Products and the “legal and privacy notices” contact if provided by Customer in conjunction with the Agreement. Customer may update these contacts at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@signinsolutions.com"><span>privacy@signinsolutions.com</span></a>.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.2. </span>The liability of SIS and its respective employees, directors, officers, Affiliates, successors, and assigns (the “<strong>SIS Parties</strong>”), arising out of or related to this DPA, whether in contract, tort, or other theory of liability, shall be subject to the ‘Exclusion of Warranties, Limitation of Liability and Indemnity’ section of the Agreement, and any reference in such section to the liability of SIS or the SIS Parties means the aggregate liability of the SIS Parties under the Agreement and this DPA together.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.3. </span>This DPA is without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the parties under the Agreement which will continue to have full force and effect. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this DPA and the terms of the Agreement, the terms of this DPA will prevail. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses then, only insofar as the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.4. </span>Unless otherwise so required under this DPA or Applicable Privacy Law, Customer and SIS each agree that the dispute resolution provisions of the Agreement (including governing law and venue) apply to this DPA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sign In App (together with its affiliated companies) makes an annual Statement in line with prevailing legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #494b4e;"> </span></strong></h3>
<p>Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person's liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. We are committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 10px; color: #494b4e;"> </span></strong></h3>
<p>We are a provider of visitor management software and accompanying hardware to organisations and the education sector globally. Given the nature of our business and scale of operations, the risk of modern slavery within our own workforce is remote. However, the Company operates a number of policies that mitigate the risk of modern slavery and sets out steps to be taken to prevent corruption generally and slavery and human trafficking in its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="color: #494b4e;">Our supply chains</span></strong></h3>
<p>SIA are currently under the threshold prescribed by the Secretary of State in relation to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 however we are committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains. We expect the same high standards from all of our suppliers and business partners, and as part of our contracting processes, we ensure that our Suppliers are committed to the same and reserve the right to request rectification where standards fall short, or move to alternative suppliers.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="color: #494b4e;">Due diligence processes for modern slavery and human trafficking</span></strong></h3>
<p>As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we conduct risk assessments and review our suppliers on an annual basis.&nbsp; We are committed to combating slavery and human trafficking and expect the same high standards from our supply chain.</p>

<h2>Accessibility Statement for Appointment Scheduling Software</h2>
<p>10to8 is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone, and applying the relevant accessibility standards.</p>
<h3>Measures to support accessibility</h3>
<p>10to8 takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of Appointment Scheduling Software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate accessibility into our procurement practices.</li>
<li>Steps in our development consider and evaluate accessibility.</li>
<li>Working third party to assess our current level of accessibility and addressing issues found.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compliance status</h3>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a><span>&nbsp;</span>defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.</p>
<p>We divide 10to8 into three distinct areas for accessibility; The 10to8 website, the booking system and our appointment scheduling system. Our aim is for all parts of 10to8 to be compliant with WCAG 2.1 level AA.</p>
<p>The 10to8 commercial website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard. It is not assessed regularly as it is large (thousands of pages) and is not part of the 10to8 product, therefore full assessment and procedures to maintain level WCAG 2.1 level AA are considered not proportionate or necessary. We endeavor to ensure it is accessible using standard web tools.</p>
<p><span>Appointment Scheduling Software is conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA.</span></p>
<p><span>Appointment Scheduling Booking System is conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA.</span></p>
<h4><span>Assessment approach</span></h4>
<p>10to8 assessed the accessibility of the Public Appointment System by the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>External evaluation by Test Partners to assess current accessibility status.</li>
<li>Work resolve any issues found.</li>
<li>Re-evaluation and certification by Test Partners to demonstrate accessibility status &amp; compliance with WCAG 2.1 level AA</li>
<li>Use of standard automatic tools to test for compliance with WCAG 2.1 level AA in development</li>
</ul>
<p>10to8 assesses the accessibility of Appointment Scheduling Software by the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>External evaluation by Kaffeinated Kodemonkey to assess current accessibility status, annually.</li>
<li>Work resolve any issues found and accept any remaining</li>
<li>Using standard automatic tools to test for compliance with WCAG 2.1 level AA in development</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical specifications</h3>
<p>Accessibility of Appointment Scheduling Software relies on the following technologies to work with the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>WAI-ARIA</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>These technologies will be relied upon for conformance with the accessibility standards as we resolve our accessibility issues.</p>
