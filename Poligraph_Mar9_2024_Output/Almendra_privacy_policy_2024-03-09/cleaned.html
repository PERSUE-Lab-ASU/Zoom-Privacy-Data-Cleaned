However, if necessary and if explicitly mentioned afterwards or if you have consented, we may share your data with group companies, brand licensees, partners and other service providers. In this case, their own privacy policies may also apply.</span></li><li style="font-weight:400" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight:400">We take all reasonable measures to ensure the security and protection of your data from misuse.</span></li><li style="font-weight:400" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight:400">Personal data are processed by us only as necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents and the services offered.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Legal basis of processing</b></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR serves us as the legal basis for processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for a delivery of goods or the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">If we are subject to a legal obligation by which a processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">In rare cases, the processing of personal data might become necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were to be injured on our premises and as a result his or her name, age, health insurance data or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overridden. Such processing operations are permitted to us in particular because they were specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, it took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR).</span></p><p></p><p><br><br></p><p><b>Data Processing When Using Our Website</b></p><p><b>Cookies</b></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">www.almendra.io uses cookies.

This general data and information is stored in the server log files. The following data may be collected: (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses our website (so-called referrer), (4) the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on our website, (5) the date and time of an access to the website, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system and (8) other similar data and information that serve to avert danger in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">When using these general data and information, Napsis Technologies LLC does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed (1) to deliver the contents of our website correctly, (2) to optimize the contents of our website and the advertising for these, (3) to ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of our website, and (4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for prosecution in the event of a cyber-attack. Therefore, Napsis Technologies LLC analyzes anonymously collected data and information on one hand, and on the other hand, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise so that we can ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from any personal data provided by a data subject.</span></p><p></p><p><b>Registration on our website</b></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The data subject has the opportunity to register on the website of the controller by providing personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller in the process results from the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller and for its own purposes. The controller may arrange for the data to be transferred to one or more processors, for example a parcel service provider, who will also use the personal data exclusively for an internal use attributable to the controller.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) of the data subject, the date as well as the time of registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that only in this way can the misuse of our services be prevented and, if necessary, this data makes it possible to clarify committed crimes. In this respect, the storage of this data is necessary for the protection of the data controller. As a matter of principle, this data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a legal obligation to pass it on or the passing on serves the purpose of criminal prosecution.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The registration of the data subject by voluntarily providing personal data serves the purpose of the controller to offer the data subject content or services which, due to the nature of the matter, can only be offered to registered users. Registered persons are free to modify the personal data provided during registration at any time or to have it completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The controller shall provide any data subject at any time upon request with information about what personal data is stored about the data subject. Furthermore, the controller shall correct or delete personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, provided that this does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations. The entire staff of the controller is available to the data subject as a contact person in this context.</span></p><p></p><p><b>Contact possibility via the website</b></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">www.almendra.io contains information that enables a quick electronic contact, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller, the personal data transmitted by the data subject will be stored automatically. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the controller will be stored for the purposes of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no disclosure of this personal data to third parties.</span></p><p></p><p><b>Routine erasure and blocking of personal data.</b></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The controller processes and stores personal data of the data subject only for the period of time necessary to achieve the purpose of storage or insofar as this has been provided for in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">If the storage purpose ceases to apply or if a storage period prescribed expires, the personal data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.</span></p><p></p><p><b>Google Analytics&nbsp;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The controller has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the collection, compilation and evaluation of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, among other things, data on which website a data subject came to a website from (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used for the optimization of a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of internet advertising.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The controller uses the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp" for web analysis via Google Analytics. By means of this additive, the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is shortened and anonymized by Google if access to our Internet pages is from a Member State of the European Union or from another State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to our website. Among other things, Google uses the data and information obtained to evaluate the use of our website, to compile online reports for us showing the activities on our website, and to provide other services related to the use of our website.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Google Analytics sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. By each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the controller and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which Google uses, among other things, to track the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently enable commission calculations.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">By means of the cookie, personal information, for example the access time, the place from which an access originated and the frequency of visits to our website by the data subject, is stored. Each time the data subject visits our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose this personal data collected via the technical procedure to third parties.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already described above, at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Furthermore, the data subject has the possibility to object to the collection of data generated by Google Analytics and related to the use of this website as well as to the processing of this data by Google and to prevent such processing. For this purpose, the data subject must download and install a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information regarding visits to Internet pages may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered by Google as an objection. If the information technology system of the data subject is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later point in time, the data subject must reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. Provided that the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the data subject or another person attributable to his or her sphere of control, there is the option of reinstalling or reactivating the browser add-on.</span></p><p></p><p><b>Facebook Custom Audiences</b></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">Our website uses the "Custom Audiences" remarketing function of Facebook Inc, 1601 S.
