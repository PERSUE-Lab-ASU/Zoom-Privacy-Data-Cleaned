<p>CXera Inc. (“we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information through our software, website, documentation, and related services (together, the “Services”).</p>
<p>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning as set forth in the Terms of Service for the Services, which can be found at <a href="https://www.cxera.com/terms-and-conditions/">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Consent</strong></h3>
<p>By using the Services, you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), you may only use the Services and disclose information to us with your parent’s or legal guardian’s express consent. Furthermore, children under the age of 13 cannot use or register for the Services in any way. Review this Privacy Policy with your parent or legal guardian to make sure you understand it. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We do not actively collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale of such information in a way that specifically identifies the individual (i.e. we don’t sell customer lists). You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using some or all of the Services.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Collection of Information</strong></h3>
<p><em>Registration Information</em></p>
<p>When registering for the Services or using the Services for the first time, we may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your name, company/organization name, phone number, and email address (these are referred to below as your “Registration Information”). Your Registration Information, together with any other information we gather through the Services that may be used to identify, contact, or locate you individually, are collectively referred to herein as your “Personal Information.”</p>
<p><em>Billing Information</em></p>
<p>When purchasing the Services, we will require you to provide financial and billing information, such as billing name and address, and credit card number (“Billing Information”).</p>
<p><em>Data</em></p>
<p>You may be able to create, upload, publish, transmit, distribute, display, store or share information, data, text, graphics, video, messages or other materials using our Services (this is collectively referred to below as “Data”). Some of this Data may be stored and maintained on our servers.</p>
<p><em>Usage and Analytics Information</em></p>
<p>We may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies, log files, and Web beacons. Collectively, this information is referred to as “Usage and Analytics Information.”</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em></p>
<p>We use standard browser cookies to allow us to remember details of a user session. For example, we may use cookies to make it easier for the user to resume a recent session without re-entering their log-in details.</p>
<p>You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Services.</p>
<p><em>Log Files</em></p>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Services. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your browser type, the pages and files you viewed, your operating system, your actions in connection with our Services, and date/time stamps associated with your usage.</p>
<p><em>Web Beacons</em></p>
<p>We use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your usage of the Services and interaction with emails from us. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website or Service tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website or Service tied to the web beacon. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites. We also use web beacons to operate and improve the Services and our email communications.</p>
<p><em>Geo-Location Information</em></p>
<p>We do not collect any information regarding your real-time geo-location while using the Services. However, we may do so at some point in the future. We will request your permission before collecting such information.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Use of Information.</strong></h3>
<p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>

We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock, including any due diligence exercise carried out in relation to the same, provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Non-US Users</strong></h3>
<p>These Services are hosted in the United States and are intended primarily for visitors located within the United States. If you choose to use the Services from other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you may be transferring your Personal Information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. By providing your Personal Information through the Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Security</strong></h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain your Personal Information in a secure environment. We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps designed to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. We have implemented procedures designed to limit the dissemination of your Personal Information to only such designated staff as are reasonably necessary to carry out the stated purposes we have communicated to you.</p>
<p>You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal Information. For instance, never give out your password, and safeguard your user name, password and personal credentials when you are using the Services, so that other people will not have access to your Personal Information. Furthermore, you are responsible for maintaining the security of any personal computing device on which you utilize the Services.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Sharing Information with Third Parties</strong></h3>
<p>You may be able to share Personal Information with third parties through use of the Services. The privacy policies of these third parties are not under our control and may differ from ours. The use of any information that you may provide to any third parties will be governed by the privacy policy of such third party or by your independent agreement with such third party, as the case may be. If you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing to a third party, we recommend that you contact that third party directly for more information or to review its privacy policy.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Receipt of Information from Third Parties</strong></h3>
<p>We integrate with third-party services to provide you with enhanced functionality and to automate the upload of data from the third-party service to our platform. Data uploaded from third-party services is associated with your account and processed according to the same guidelines that apply to your Data and Personal Information generally.<br>
In particular, our Services are designed to integrate with your Google Drive. Your Google Drive can be linked to your CXera account using OAuth authentication. OAuth is a secure mechanism which gives us access to your Google Drive data and your basic Google account information without letting us know your password. This token is valid during your use of our Services and is saved locally on your device. Our Google Drive integration allows you to use the Services to:</p>
<ol>
<li>See, edit, and delete your Google Drive files</li>
<li>View information about your Google Drive files</li>
<li>View the photos, videos and albums in your Google Photos</li>
<li>View and manage metadata of files in your Google Drive</li>
<li>Upload your Google Drive files to our platform</li>
</ol>
<p>Aside from the Google Drive files that you expressly choose to upload to our platform, no Google user data is stored by the Services.<br>
Our Services are also designed to integrate with your Zoom account through use of OAuth authentication and Zoom’s API’s. Use of our Zoom integration allows you to use the Services to view your meetings and recordings, and also allows us to see your basic Zoom user account information. No Zoom user data is stored by the Services aside from your Zoom user id.<br>
In addition to our normal procedures for managing and deleting your Data discussed below, you can manage and revoke our Google Drive integration and Zoom integration’s access to your data by using the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Permissions Page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/installed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoom Permissions Page</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>9. Retention</strong></h3>
<p>We will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. We may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained Personal Information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please note that if you request that your Personal Information be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all of your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Amendment of this Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy in the future, we will post or provide appropriate notice. Any non-material change (such as clarifications) to this Privacy Policy will become effective on the date the change is posted, and any material changes will become effective 30 days from their posting on <a href="https://www.cxera.com/privacy-policy/">https://www.cxera.com/privacy-policy/</a> or via email to your listed email address. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information that we have about you and your account. The date on which the latest update was made is indicated at the top of this document. We recommend that you print a copy of this Privacy Policy for your reference and revisit this policy from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Services signifies your acceptance of any changes.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Access and Accuracy</strong></h3>
<p>You have the right to access the Personal Information we hold about you in order to verify the Personal Information we have collected in respect to you and to have a general account of our uses of that information. Upon receipt of your written request, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Information, although in certain limited circumstances we may not be able to make all relevant information available to you, such as where that information also pertains to another user. In such circumstances we will provide reasons for the denial to you upon request. We will endeavor to deal with all requests for access and modifications in a timely manner.</p>
<p>We will make every reasonable effort to keep your Personal Information accurate and up-to-date, and we will provide you with mechanisms to update, correct, delete or add to your Personal Information as appropriate. As appropriate, this amended Personal Information will be transmitted to those parties to which we are permitted to disclose your information. Having accurate Personal Information about you enables us to give you the best possible service</p>
<h3><strong>12. Contact Us</strong></h3>
<p>You can help by keeping us informed of any changes such as a change of email address or telephone number.
