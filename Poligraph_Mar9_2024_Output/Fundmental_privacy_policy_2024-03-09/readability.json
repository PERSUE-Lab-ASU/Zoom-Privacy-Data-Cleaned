IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE STOP USING THE SERVICE IMMEDIATELY AND WHERE RELEVANT UNINSTALL.Data ControllerThe registration, access and use of the Service, shall involve the collection, registration and obtaining of various categories of data of users who use the service (hereinafter, without distinction, \u201cUser\u201d or \u201cUsers\u201d).\n\n\n\nThe data controller of the personal data of the Users of this Service, is Platform FL, LLC registered in Florida (USA), and located at 8051 N Tamiami trail, suite E6, Sarasota, Fl, 34243. USA (hereinafter, the \u201cData Controller\u201d).\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Data Controller is the natural or legal person, who determines and decides the content, means and purposes of the use and processing of the User's personal information.\n\nData processing means any operation carried out on personal information, through automated or non-automated means, consisting of or implying its collection, registration, structuring, consultation, collation, storage, saving, modification, deletion, limitation, destruction, communication and interconnection.Concept of personal dataA personal data is any information referring to a natural person, which allows it to be identified or makes it identifiable without disproportionate effort.\n\nIt should be noted that the concept of personal data only applies to information associated with natural persons (not legal persons or companies), so certain business data such as a name or registered office, will not fall within the concept of personal information.\n\n\u200b\n\nLikewise, irreversibly dissociated information, which cannot be linked or singled out in a particular natural person, will not be defined as personal information, but as anonymous information (or non-personal data).Categories of Data processedAs User of the Service, both during the registration process and in the subsequent use of the Service, as well as in questionnaires of additional information, the Data Controller shall request and have access to personal data, such as:\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying data (e.g. name, surname)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact details (e.g. postal address, email, telephone)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal characteristics (e.g. gender, age)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional data (e.g. position, employer, professional experience, accreditations, licenses, designations, functions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial data (e.g. equity, mortgages, asset level, savings capacity, expectations)\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal information that is not marked as optional on registration forms or questionnaires shall be considered necessary and indispensable to access the service and make use of the Service. Certain fields or categories of data shall be considered optional, such as: licenses, designations, email or secondary telephone.\n\n\n\nThe holders of the personal information obtained and processed shall be the Service Users, differentiated or divided into four possible profiles: investor (individual or corporate/institutional); advisor; asset manager; and external advisor.\n\n\n\nThe categories of data requested may vary depending on the type of profile selected by the User when registering and signing up for the Service.Purposes of the processingThe personal data provided by the user, in the different phases of registration, access and use of the Service, shall be processed by the Data Controller to fulfill the following specific purposes:\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess to the service provided to the User through the Service and use of the functionalities of the same (configuration of user profile, chat conversations, generation of surveys, synchronization of contacts, notifications about notifications and information of interest).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecution and fulfillment of the legal or contractual relationship between the parties (Controller and User), reflected in the acceptance of the terms and conditions of use by the User.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending of informative communications, such as notices of technical incidents, changes in functionality, or updates of the Service and its terms of use, privacy policy and cookies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending promotional communications electronically, about content, news and services related to the Service.\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of statistics based on previously anonymized data, limiting the possibility of linking, singling out and inferring the information with a specific natural person or User.\n\n\n\nAttention and response to requests for exercise of rights submitted by Users, especially those aimed at the rectification and deletion of their personal data.\n\n\n\nIndividualized decisions will not be made through automated processing, likely to produce significant legal effects on the rights and freedoms of Users.LegitimacyThe legal bases that legitimize the Data Controller to process the Users' data are essentially the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe free, specific, informed and unequivocal consent of the User, making available this privacy policy, which must be accepted by means of a statement or a clear affirmative action, such as marking a box provided for this purpose. In this sense, it should be noted that omissions or inactions understood as tacit consent do not constitute an unequivocal consent of the User.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cases where it is necessary - such as the sending of promotional communications electronically - obtaining the express consent of the User, which enables the Data Controller to send communications electronically for this specific purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the existence and execution of a previous contractual or legal relationship, existing between the Data Controller and the User, by accepting the terms and conditions of use of the service or Service. This legal basis shall also apply, on a supplementary basis, as an exception to the general rule of consent for promotional communications by electronic means.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn no case shall the processing of personal data of Users be carried out without there being legitimate cause or legal basis, which allows to affirm the lawfulness of the processing of the information.Retention of DataThe personal data provided by the User will be kept in the systems and databases of the Data Controller, as long as the latter continues to make use of the Service, and are useful for the purposes that initially motivated its obtaining. At the time any User requests the deactivation of his/her account, or requests the deletion of their information, personal information will be deleted or erased, so that it disappears from the interface of the Service, and may affect the following contents or elements of their account:\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\nProfile and personal information (e.g. identification data, professionals, contact, image)\n\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\n\n\u00a0Individual and/or group chats\n\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\n\n\u00a0Any user-generated content (e.g. surveys, literary, photographic or audiovisual content)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\n\n\u00a0List of contacts (including those synchronized with the device's agenda or account on the Linkedin social network)\n\n\n\nHowever, the data may be kept internally, in the databases or systems of the Data Controller, for the period of prescription that is necessary with the aim of purging the possible responsibilities derived from the processing, although in any case, an attempt shall be made to adopt and effectively comply with the principle of minimum retention of personal data.\n\n\n\nIn any case, the information shall be kept subject to blocking and limiting, through strict technical and organizational measures, the access, use and/or visualization thereof, being available only to the competent authorities and bodies that may request or request it, especially in the framework of investigations and administrative or judicial procedures.\n\n\n\nOnce the aforementioned period has ended, the information will be permanently deleted or destroyed.\u00a0Recipients and International TransfersThe personal data provided by the Users shall not be transferred to third parties, except under legal obligation or in the event that they are requested by competent authorities or bodies, in the framework of administrative, judicial or investigation procedures.\n\n\n\nHowever, the User is informed that third parties (Ex: Google) may use data storage and retrieval devices (cookies), which allow certain categories of information to be obtained from users of the Service, for analytical purposes, for activity measurement or to generate statistics. You can learn more about these aspects by consulting our Cookie Policy:\u00a0www.myfundamental.net/cookies-policy.\n\n\n\nThere is also no provision for international transfers of personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), involving international movements of information, and under no circumstances to countries that do not guarantee a sufficient level of reciprocity with regard to the security of personal data.\n\n\n\nIn the event that this circumstance is modified, it shall be duly recorded in this Privacy Policy, in order to inform the user about the reason for the transmission, the possible recipients and the guarantees adopted.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, certain service providers subcontracted by the Data Controller (hereinafter, the \u201cData Processors\u201d), such as hosting, system providers and IT media, or cloud services, may have potential access to the personal information of Users, for the sole purpose of fulfilling the services contracted by the Data Controller.\n\n\n\nThe Data Processors shall be legally linked to the Data Controller, by means of a processing contract, or conditions and terms of service that guarantee the confidentiality, security and secrecy of the information processed.Security MeasuresThe personal data provided by the Users shall not be transferred to third parties, except under legal obligation or in the event that they are requested by competent authorities or bodies, in the framework of administrative, judicial or investigation procedures.\n\nThe Data Controller shall take the technical and organizational measures necessary to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of the data collected and processed through this Service.\n\nAmong the main security measures applied by the Data Controller, the following are noteworthy, but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of data processing systems and services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident, including the regular backup and establishment of back-up recovery protocols and procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous processing for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechniques of encryption, pseudonymization and/or anonymization of personal data appropriate and adapted to the level of risk or criticality of the information processed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical measures that allow the adoption of a privacy system by design and by default in the use of the Service.\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, the Data Controller has specific protocols and procedures regarding risk management and the resolution, notification and management of security breaches, with the aim of neutralizing and minimizing any possible damage or condition that may occur, eventually, on the personal information of Users.\n\nThere is also no provision for international transfers of personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), involving international movements of information, and under no circumstances to countries that do not guarantee a sufficient level of reciprocity with regard to the security of personal data.\n\n\n\nIn the event that this circumstance is modified, it shall be duly recorded in this Privacy Policy, in order to inform the user about the reason for the transmission, the possible recipients and the guarantees adopted.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, certain service providers subcontracted by the Data Controller (hereinafter, the \u201cData Processors\u201d), such as hosting, system providers and IT media, or cloud services, may have potential access to the personal information of Users, for the sole purpose of fulfilling the services contracted by the Data Controller.\n\n\n\nThe Data Processors shall be legally linked to the Data Controller, by means of a processing contract, or conditions and terms of service that guarantee the confidentiality, security and secrecy of the information processed.Exercise of User rightsThe User may exercise at any time his/her rights of access, rectification, deletion, limitation, opposition and portability, as well as revoke the consent initially given when this is the legal basis that legitimizes the processing of his personal data, in a simple way and for free, by communication addressed to the email address:\u00a0admin@myfundamental.net.\n\n\n\nThe Data Controller reserves the right to request accreditation that allows verification of the User's identity or additional information that is necessary to be able to comply with their request for the exercise of rights.\n\n\n\nWe will respond as soon as possible to your request, sending you a response within the legally established deadlines, to the same electronic address used by you to submit the request for the exercise of rights, or, where appropriate, to the additional electronic or physical address indicated to us to send you the answer.Complaints to the supervisory AuthorityThe User is entitled to lodge complaints in defense of his/her rights with the competent data protection authorities or equivalent bodies that have assumed such competence.\n\n\n\nThe User may submit claims to the competent control authority in their country of habitual residence, taking into account the cooperation mechanisms established among the competent bodies at the international level. In certain countries or territories, data protection supervisory authorities will not be specific, since these powers will be conferred on other competent bodies, for example, in the field of trade or consumption (e.g.: U.S.A).\n\n\n\nHowever, the competence of the national supervisory authority of the User's country of habitual residence will depend to a large extent on the territorial scope of its legislation and, where appropriate, on the extraterritorial nature of such legislation.Online Promotional CommunicationsThe purposes of the User's processing indicated in this Privacy Policy include the possibility for the Data Controller to send promotional communications.\n\n\n\nAs a general rule, the Data Controller will not send promotional communications electronically to the User of the Service, in the event that the latter has not previously given an express and specific consent for their receipt by this means.\n\n\n\nFor the purposes hereof, e-mail, instant messaging applications, SMS, MMS, Bluetooth, or any analogous means having equivalent functionalities for the purpose of establishing communications and sending information to a recipient shall be considered electronic means.\n\n\n\nFor the electronic transmission of this type of promotional communications, the Data Controller will request the express consent of the User, with the aim of obtaining an explicit request in the reception of this type of electronic communications, in accordance with this specific purpose of the processing.\n\n\n\nHowever, as an exception to the general rule, the Data Controller may send promotional communications to the User, provided that there is a prior legal relationship between the parties and such communications refer to services similar to those initially requested by the User and provided through the Service.\n\n\n\nThe User may unsubscribe from its reception at any time, by request addressed in a simple way and for free, to the email address:\u00a0admin@myfundamental.net.Policy modificationsThe Data Controller reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy, at any time, due to changes in regulations, applicable laws and jurisprudence. Such changes will be recorded by notice to Users, and through the convenient update of the last date of edition of this Policy.Contact detailsFor any questions or queries regarding the processing of your personal data as a User, or in relation to the content of the Privacy Policy, you may contact the Data Controller by communication addressed to the email address:\u00a0admin@myfundamental.net.For EU UsersApplicable legislation\n\nThe applicable legislation on personal data protection and privacy shall mainly be the legislation in force at European level:\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679, of April 27, 2016, or General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): this standard is superior at the hierarchical level and sets the highest standards of security. Its application is extraterritorial, since it is not essential that the data controller has its headquarters or establishment in the European Union (EU), and can be applied whenever it affects EU citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther possible rules applicable at European level would be:\n\n\n\n\n\nDirective 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2000, on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the internal market: this rule applies to promotional communications by electronic means.\n\n\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1807 of November 14, 2018 for the free movement of non-personal data in the EU: this regulation regulates the processing of anonymous or non-personal data.\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, within the territory of the EU, national regulations of the different countries or Member States in which the Service Users reside may be applicable, provided that their territorial scope requires, for example: (i) the effect on the rights and freedoms of citizens residing in said territory; and/or (ii) that the processing of data takes place in that country or territory, regardless of where the establishment or registered office of the data controller is located.\n\nProcessing of Personal Information is necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations towards you and providing you with our services, to protect our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations.\n\nSince we operate globally, it may be necessary to transfer data, including Personal Information, to countries outside the European Union. In these instances, we will transfer your data only to such countries as approved by the European Commission as providing adequate level of data protection or enter into legal agreements ensuring an adequate level of data protection.For California UsersGeneral\n\nThis notice addresses the specific disclosure requirements under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (Cal.
