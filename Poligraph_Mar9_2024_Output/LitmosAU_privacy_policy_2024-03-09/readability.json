This could include (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out herein and other information a user provides about his or her identity against applicable sanctioned-party lists; (ii) regular repetition of such checks whenever a sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her information; (iii) blocking of access to Litmos\u2019s services and systems in case of a potential match; and (iv) contacting a user to confirm his or her identity in case of a potential match. Any such use of your Personal Data is based on the permission to process Personal Data in order to comply with statutory obligations (Article 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR or the equivalent articles under other national laws, when applicable) and Litmos \u2018s legitimate interest (Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or the equivalent articles under other national laws, when applicable).</p>\n<p><u>Processing based on Litmos\u2019s legitimate interest </u></p>\n<p>Litmos can use your Personal Data based on its legitimate interest (Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or the equivalent articles under other national laws, when applicable) as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fraud and Legal Claims.</strong> If required, Litmos will use your Personal Data for the purposes of preventing or prosecuting criminal activities such as fraud and to assert or defend against legal claims.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Questionnaires and survey.</strong> Litmos could invite you to participate in questionnaires and surveys. These questionnaires and surveys will be generally designed in a way that they can be answered without any data that can be used to identify you. If you nonetheless enter such data in a questionnaire or survey, Litmos will use this personal data to improve its products and services.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contract Performance.</strong> If you purchase or intend to purchase goods or services from Litmos on behalf of a corporate customer or otherwise be the nominated contact person for the business relationship between a corporate customer (a \u201cCustomer Contact\u201d) and Litmos, Litmos will use your Personal Data for this purpose. This includes, for the avoidance of doubt, such steps which are required for establishing the relevant business relationship. In case that an existing Customer Contact informs Litmos that you are his replacement, Litmos will, from the point in time of such notification, consider you to be the relevant Customer Contact for the respective customer until you object as further set out below.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creation of anonymized data sets.</strong> Litmos will anonymize Personal Data provided under this Privacy Statement to create anonymized data sets, which will then be used to improve its and its affiliates\u2019 products and services.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Personalized Newsletter.</strong> If you opt-in to receive marketing communications such as newsletters from Litmos, Litmos will collect and store details of how you interact with the newsletters to help create, develop, operate, deliver and improve our newsletter communications with you. This information is aggregated and used to help Litmos provide more useful information and to understand what is of most interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Recordings for quality improvement purposes.</strong> In case of telephone calls or chat sessions, Litmos will record such calls (after informing you accordingly during that call and before the recording starts) or chat sessions in order to improve the quality of Litmos\u2019s services.</li>\n<li></li>\n<li><strong>To keep you up-to-date or request feedback.</strong> Within an existing business relationship between you and Litmos, Litmos might inform you, where permitted in accordance with local laws, about its products or services (including webinars, seminars or events) which are similar or relate to such products and services you have already purchased or used from Litmos. Furthermore, where you have attended a webinar, seminar or event of Litmos or purchased products or services from Litmos, Litmos might contact you for feedback regarding the improvement of the relevant webinar, seminar, event, product or service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Right to Object</strong></p>\n<p>You can at any time object to Litmos\u2019s use of your Personal Data as set forth in this section by sending an email to privacy@litmos.com. In this case, Litmos will carefully review your objection and cease further use of the relevant information, subject to Litmos\u2019s compelling legitimate grounds for continued use of the information, which override your interest in objecting, or if Litmos requires the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>\n<p><strong>C. Cookies and Similar Tools</strong></p>\n<p>Information gathered by cookies or similar technologies, and any use of such information, is further described in Litmos\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.litmos.com/cookie-statement\">Cookie Statement</a>.

If Litmos must request additional information from you outside of information that is already maintained by Litmos, Litmos will only use it to verify your identity so you can exercise your data protection rights, or for security and fraud-prevention purposes.</p>\n<p>In addition to contacting Litmos at privacy@litmos.com, you may also exercise your rights as follows.
