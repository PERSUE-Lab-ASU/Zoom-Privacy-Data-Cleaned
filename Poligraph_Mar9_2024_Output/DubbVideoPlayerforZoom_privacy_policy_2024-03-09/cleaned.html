<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens_en</a></p> <h3>CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT COMPLIANCE (CalOPPA)</h3> <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p> <p>Because we value your privacy, we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA).</p> <p>According to the California Online Privacy act, you have the following rights:</p> <ul><li>Know what personal data is being collected.</li> <li>Know whether your personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.</li> <li>Access to your personal data.</li> <li>Request to delete any personal information about you.</li> <li>Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.</li></ul> <h3>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY (CCPA)</h3> <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. You have the right to request that businesses subject to the CCPA (which may include our Users with whom you have a relationship) disclose certain information to you about their collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. In addition, you have the right to ask such businesses to delete Personal Information collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. If the business sells Personal Information, you have a right to opt-out of that sale. Finally, a business cannot discriminate against you for exercising a CCPA right.</p> <p>When offering services to its Users, Dubb acts as a “service provider” under the CCPA and our receipt and collection of any consumer Personal Information is completed on behalf of our Users in order for us to provide the Service. Please direct any requests for access or deletion of your Personal Information under the CCPA to the Dubb User with whom you have a direct relationship.</p> <p>Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your applicable CCPA rights, we won’t charge you different prices or provide you a different quality of services. If we ever offer a financial incentive or product enhancement that is contingent upon you providing your Personal Information, we will not do so unless the benefits to you are reasonably related to the value of the Personal Information that you provide to us.</p> <h3>CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION</h3> <p>We are in compliance with the requirements of the and specifically with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA – U.S regulation) and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation - European regulation) regarding the protection of the personal data of minors. We do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age.</p> <h3>EDITING AND DELETING INFORMATION</h3> <p>If you believe that any information, we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect. You can change, modify, rectify and delete your Information at any time, please contact us through the contact information. To opt-out of Dubb email, follow the instructions included in the email. Your request should be processed within 48 hours.</p> <h3>SUPPLIERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES</h3> <p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information Dubb collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether other users or suppliers on Dubb, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Dubb does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. Dubb is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the Dubb site. Dubb encourages you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p> <h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3> <p>Dubb will post modifications by date to this Privacy Policy to inform you of any changes. Dubb reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, please review it frequently.</p> <h3>ENFORCEMENT</h3> <p>Dubb regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or Dubb treatment of personal information by contacting us.</p> <p>When we receive formal written complaints, it is Dubb policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Dubb and an individual.</p> <h3>CONTACT US</h3> <p>If you have questions or concerns about these Privacy Policy and the handling and security of your data on this website, please contact us throw our contact page or contact at:</p> <p><a href="mailto:support@dubb.com">support@dubb.com</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div> <div class="footer d-flex flex-column"><div class="bg-white"><div class="container-fluid d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-center justify-content-between py-4"><div></div> <div class="d-flex align-items-center"><img src="https://do.dubbcdn.com/img/dubb-icon.png" alt="" class="mr-2" width="16" height="16">
