<p>We wish to inform you that RINGOVER will act as a controller only for traffic and billing data necessary for the operation of the Service.</p>
<p>In addition, the contests we organize can take place on different platforms. In addition to the processing of personal information by us, personal data is also processed by the operator of the platform. Furthermore, we would like to point out that RINGOVER is not responsible for the processing of personal data on any other platform.</p>
<h2 id="section3_h2">3. Data recipients</h2><p>Your personal data are intended for:</p>
<ul>
<li>RINGOVER and its authorized personnel who, by virtue of their duties, need to have knowledge of it for the purposes of the processing;</li>
<li>The banking institution in charge of the payment of your subscription to the Services;</li>
<li>The service providers, as data processors, that RINGOVER uses to provide the Service;</li>
<li>Public bodies to meet legal obligations and court orders.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section4_h2">4. Access to and transfer of your personal data</h2><p>Ringover takes all necessary measures to ensure compliance with the GDPR and, therefore, the confidentiality of your personal data. For this reason, only a limited number of people can have access to your personal data, knowing that measures of Personal Data protection were set up with all these recipients, in particular by means of contractual provisions.</p>
<p>For the provision of the Services, RINGOVER may have to transfer certain personal data provided by the Customer to sub-processors, who may be located outside the European Economic Area and do not ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data.</p>
<p>To this end, RINGOVER undertakes, in accordance with the GDPR, to set up a mechanism to cover such a transfer in a manner that complies with the GDPR and in particular with the standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission to govern the transfer of personal data to sub-processors located outside the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>In this case, Ringover’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" class="u-inline-link" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
<p>In order to comply with American legislation, some of your data, for example your phone numbers, first and last names, will be transferred to TCR, based in the United States of America, so that you can conduct your prospecting and commercial campaigns. If you do not register, you will not be able to legally carry out your campaigns in the United States of America. For further information, you can read TCR’s privacy policy hereby: <a href="https://www.campaignregistry.com/privacy-policy/" class="u-inline-link" target="_blank">https://www.campaignregistry.com/privacy-policy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="section5_h2">5. Where your data is stored?</h2><p>All the personal data we collect, outside the US market, is hosted on our servers in France or the European Union. We have facilities at six points of presence in the Paris region and in the French overseas departments.</p>
<p><b>We do not use service providers to host your personal data.</b></p><h2 id="section6_h2">6. How do we secure your personal data?</h2><p>RINGOVER implements all the technical and organizational measures necessary to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the personal data collected and processed, and in particular to prevent them from being distorted, damaged or communicated to unauthorized third parties, by ensuring a level of security appropriate to the risks associated with the processing and the nature of the personal data to be protected, taking into account the level of technology and the cost of implementation.</p>
<p>Calls made from Ringover Applications are encrypted (SRTP). Requests to the API are made using HTTPS only (TLS).</p>
<p>Incoming and outgoing calls (except intra-Ringover calls) are handled via direct interconnections with the telephone operators providing the transit.</p>
<p>In any case, Ringover undertakes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notify any personal data breaches in accordance with the provisions of Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR.</li>
<li>Inform the Customers and Users concerned in the event of personal data breaches likely to give rise to a high risk to their rights and freedoms, in simple and clear terms and describing the likely consequences of the breach as well as the measures implemented by RINGOVER in order to remedy the breach, including those aimed at mitigating the possible negative consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that each User or Customer contributes to the protection of his or her personal data by respecting the rules prescribed in the general terms and conditions of sale, in particular concerning his or her login identifiers.</p>

<p>Other information needed to provide you with the information or services you are requesting.</p>
<p>You may enter this information through our contact us form or through our customer portal, available at Ringover.com. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, even those that have websites linked to or from our website or who act as our marketing agents, dealers or who are designated as Ringover Marketing Partners. We encourage you to review the respective privacy policies of any such third parties.</p>
<p>When you browse our website, you do so anonymously. As with most websites, our website collects certain information automatically, such as the internet domain from which you access our websites, IP address, the type of browser and operating system you use, the date and time of access, pages visited, and the address of the website from which you linked to our website. Like many websites, our website uses cookies to collect information about how you use the website and to assist us in improving our website by understanding how it is used by customers. We do not link this automatically collected data to any personal information. Please see below for more information about our cookies and tracking policy.</p>
<p>We may use the information we collect about your through our website to administer your account; improve Services; correspond with you, particularly when you submit an inquiry, or sign up to receive products or Services, or other communications and updates from us; to maintain the security and integrity of our website, products and Services; to administer, review and improve our website, products or Services; or, should you become a customer, for purposes permitted by your agreements with us, if any, to enable us to provide you with and bill you for certain products or Services. Your information can also be used for the following purposes: recording your Subscription to the Service and assigning a Ringover number; call, fax and text message routing; integrations with your professional tools; management of contacts and user sound files; generating and providing statistics on your calls; access to and use of your personal space (app.ringover.com and dashboard.ringover.com); payment management; managing signatures for contractual documentation; and sending newsletters, updates and other information on your calls.</p><h3 id="section03_h3">Children</h3><p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive information from children under the age of 13, nor send them requests for personal information. In the event that we determine that we possess personal information from children under the age of 13, we will delete that information.</p><h2 id="section04_h2">Other recipients of the personal information</h2><p>Some products and services may be provided by third-party vendors, such as the manufacturers of various equipment or devices which may be purchased or leased from Ringover.</p>
    <p>We will not share or sell your personal information with third parties, other than to our Marketing Partners, agents, and dealers; third party telecommunications carriers and Internet backbone providers; vendors, licensors and suppliers, including payment processors, software or hardware providers, our customer portal host, and others who perform similar functions on our behalf and require such information to provide, bill for or maintain the products and services you have ordered; to protect our network and customers and the networks of our telecommunications carriers and Internet backbone providers; in connection with certain advertising on our website (see more below in the section on cookies); and as otherwise required or permitted by law.</p>
    <p>We may disclose your personal information when such disclosure is required or authorized by law or through legal process, or when pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings, to protect our legal rights, or to defend and protect the rights of others; in connection with a sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution involving Ringover; and when necessary to respond to an emergency, which includes protecting your safety or the safety of others.</p><h2 id="section05_h2">How we protect your information</h2><p>We make reasonable efforts to maintain the security of our servers and computer networks in order to help prevent the loss, misuse, and modification of the personal information we collect on our website. We protect the security of your personal information by using specialized software during the Service application process, enrollment, or when you pay for Services via our customer portal. We also maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the personal information in our possession. We have established security protocols to ensure that we are doing our part to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security and integrity of our systems. Even though we take reasonable steps to maintain information security, and expect our vendors to do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information.</p>
<p>We also encourage our customers to do their part in protecting their personal and sensitive information, including being responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account login information and other passwords.</p><h2 id="section06_h2">Customer proprietary network information (CPNI)</h2><p>Certain of the information that we collect from you may constitute Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI. CPNI is certain information that we obtain solely by virtue of providing you with the VoIP Services, and that concerns the VoIP Services you purchase, including the type, destination, technical configuration, location and amount of use of such Services, along with related billing information.</p>
    <p>From time to time, we will use the CPNI information we have on file to provide you with information about our communications-related products and services or special promotions. Ringover’s use of CPNI may also enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to your specific needs. Ringover may use your CPNI to let you know about communications-related services other than those to which you currently subscribe that Ringover believes may be of interest to you. In some instances, Ringover will want to share Customer’s CPNI with parties who are authorized to offer Ringover’s services or who perform functions on Ringover’s behalf, such as independent contractors, suppliers, agents or “Marketing Partners,” in order to provide Customer with information about Ringover’s communications-related products and services or special promotions. Your signature on a service agreement or sales order signifies Customer’s consent that Ringover may use and disclose CPNI as described herein.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, you do have the right to restrict Ringover’s use of your CPNI. <strong>Customer may deny, withdraw or restrict our right to use CPNI at any time by advising Ringover via email message to <a href="mailto:customerservice@ringover.com" class="u-inline-link">customerservice@ringover.com</a>.</strong> If Customer denies or restricts its approval for Ringover to use Customer’s CPNI, Customer will suffer no effect, now or in the future, with regard to how Ringover provides any Services to which Customer subscribes. Any denial or restriction of Customer’s approval remains valid until Customer’s Services are discontinued or Customer affirmatively revokes or limits such approval or denial.</p>
    <p>Ringover may disclose CPNI without your consent, and without asking for Customer’s authorization, in any of the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When disclosure is required by law or court order.</li>
    <li>To protect the rights and property of Ringover or to protect Customer and other carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of services.</li>
    <li>For directory listings.</li>
    <li>To provide Ringover Services to the Customer, including assisting Customer with troubles associated with its Services. Without limiting the foregoing, if you purchased your Ringover Services through a designated Ringover “Marketing Partner,” that entity will provide you with certain support services, and Ringover will share your CPNI with that Marketing Partner as necessary to enable it to provide you with customer support.</li>
    <li>To bill the Customer for Services.</li>
    <li>When Customer has approved use of their CPNI for Ringover, or Ringover’s partners, affiliates, or independent contractors.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Federal privacy rules require Ringover to authenticate the identity of the Customer calling Ringover prior to disclosing CPNI. Customers calling Ringover can discuss their Services and billings with a Ringover representative once that representative has verified the caller’s identity. There are three methods by which Ringover will conduct Customer authentication:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>By having the Customer provide a pre-established password and/or PIN;</li>
    <li>By calling the Customer back at the telephone number associated with the Services purchased; or</li>
    <li>By mailing the requested documents to the Customer’s address or email address of record.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event the Customer fails to remember their password and/or PIN, Ringover will ask the Customer a series of questions known only to the Customer and Ringover in order to authenticate the Customer. You may manage your password in the online customer portal available at <a href="mailto:support@ringover.com" class="u-inline-link">support@ringover.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Ringover will notify you of changes to your account. These notifications may be sent to a postal or e-mail address, or by telephone, voicemail or text message.</p>
    <p>In addition to the protections described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Ringover employees are trained on how CPNI is to be protected and when it may or may not be disclosed. Ringover maintains records of its own and its joint venture partners and/or independent contractors (if applicable) sales and marketing campaigns that may utilize Customer CPNI. Ringover also keeps records of instances in which CPNI is disclosed to third parties or where third parties were allowed access to Customer CPNI.</p>
    <p>In the event Ringover experiences a privacy breach and CPNI is disclosed to unauthorized persons, Ringover will notify law enforcement as required by Federal regulations. Ringover cannot inform Customer of the CPNI breach until at least seven (7) days after notification has been sent to law enforcement, or later if law enforcement directs us to postpone disclosure pending investigation. Ringover is required to maintain certain records regarding any breach involving the release of CPNI and retain these records for a period of not less than two (2) years.</p><h2 id="section07_h2">Your California privacy rights</h2><p>If you are a California resident, you may request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by Ringover to a third party, if any, for a third party’s direct marketing purposes once per calendar year. If applicable, this information would include the categories of information and the names and addresses of businesses with which we shared information in the prior calendar year.</p>
<p>To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:dpo@ringover.com" class="u-inline-link">dpo@ringover.com</a>, with “Request for California Privacy Information” in the subject line or body of the email or letter.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:dpo@ringover.com" class="u-inline-link">dpo@ringover.com</a>.</p><h2 id="section08_h2">Changes and updates to this policy</h2><p>We will change and update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, the Privacy Policy version date, at the top of this page, will be updated to reflect that revision. We encourage you to periodically re-read this Privacy Policy to see if any changes could affect you.</p><h2 id="section09_h2">Cookies and tracking technology</h2><p>Like many other websites, Ringover collects data with cookies during browsing of the websites Ringover.com or Myringover.com (“Site”) or the Ringover Application. A cookie is a small text, image or software file that is placed and stored on the User’s or Customer’s computer, smartphone or any other device allowing internet browsing (“Terminal”).</p>
<p>Cookies are very useful for allowing a website to recognize a User or Customer, marking their passage from one page to another and bringing additional benefits such as: increased ease of browsing, secured connection and adaptation of web page content according to their preferences and Terminal.</p>
<p>A cookie does not directly identify a user (it does not contain names or first names), but rather your Terminal’s browser or the application used. However, it allows the actions of the same user to be followed using the unique identifier contained in the cookie file. The term "cookie" is also used generically to refer to other similar technologies such as web beacons or invisible pixels, which are small digital images invisible to the user integrated on web pages or in emails and associated with the placement of cookies used to track and analyze the same user’s navigation.</p>
<p>The information stored by cookies, during a period of limited validity, includes pages visited, advertisements on which the User clicks, the type of browser used and their IP address as well as the information they have entered on the Site.</p><h3 id="section091_h3">Types of cookies used on the Site</h3><h4>1. Technical and feature cookies</h4><p>Technical cookies include the cookies necessary to obtain information required for navigation of our Site and applications (session identifiers, your operating system version, and the version of the application used), allowing you to use principal features of the site or application. Feature cookies allow you to access specific features and be recognized, marking your movements from one page to the next as well as improving your ease of navigation; adapting site presentation to your Terminal’s preferences (language used, resolution), memorizing passwords and other information using forms you have filled out on the Site or Application (sign-up or access through the MyRingover space). Technical cookies also allow the implementation of security measures (for example, when you are asked to log in again to the MyRingover space after a certain period of time has elapsed).</p>
    <p>We do not ask your permission for the placement of these cookies. Nonetheless, you can object to the use of these cookies and delete them in your browser settings, although such a step may prevent you from being able to access the Site, the Application or services.</p>
    <p>These cookies have a very short lifespan: strictly necessary cookies last for the duration of the session, and for feature cookies, from a few hours at least to a year at most.</p><h4>2. Analytical and traffic measuring cookies</h4><p>Cookies measuring traffic are emitted by us or by our technical contractors.</p>
    <p>Cookies are used for statistical analysis of the navigation modalities for Users of the Site and Application. The results of this analysis are treated anonymously and exclusively for statistical purposes, and only if the service provider uses cookies related to the browser or other Terminals used to navigate the Site.</p>
    <p>In addition to traffic analysis, they allow, if necessary, the detection of navigation problems, therefore improving the practicality of our services.</p>
    <p>The traffic analyzing services used by the Site and Application produce and send to our technical service providers only aggregated statistics and traffic volumes, with the exclusion of any individual information.</p>
    <p>These traffic analytics cookies will not last beyond 13 months.</p>
    <p>We also use tools to measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, which enable us to engage in relevant commercial actions based on information collected (for example, sending a new message or a personalized offer).</p>
    <p>You can choose to opt out of analytics cookies from your browsing data. To do this, please see the information below under “Your preferences on cookie placement.”</p><h4>3. Advertising cookies</h4><p>Use of advertising space on our Site and Application contributes financially to the content and services that we provide to you. Use of advertising cookies allows you to view ads or follow sponsored links that we determine (or that our partners determine) to be most adapted to your user profile according to your areas of interest, your Terminal, your browsing history or geographic position. It also allows ads from other sites to be adapted to your user profile.</p>
    <p>The relevance of public content opened on our Site or third party sites can be achieved thanks to third party technology, through the association of navigation information on the Terminals that you use to connect to our Sites and Application or other sites or applications, and with the data you provide to us during your registration or access to any of our services.</p>
    <p>To prevent the use of third party cookies, please see the information below under “Your preferences on cookie placement.”</p>
    <p>Refusal of these advertising cookies will not impact the use of our Sites or Application. However, refusing them will not block ads. It instead will only result in showing ads unspecified to your areas of interest.</p><h4>4. Sharing cookies (social media)</h4><p>Our Sites and Application contain cookies for links to Facebook and other social media sites, allowing you to share content from our Site with others, make them aware of your tips or opinions concerning the Sites or Application, or even to connect in order to access the entirety of Ringover’s Services via your login information on these social media networks.</p>
    <p>This is notably the case with sharing buttons for such social media sites as “Facebook,” “Twitter,” or ”LinkedIn,” which are present on our blog, for example. The social networks providing these buttons are likely to identify you with them, even if you do not use them while consulting our Sites and Application.</p>
    <p>These cookies are directly placed by the social media networks. If you are connected to social media while browsing our Sites and Application, the buttons allow content to be shared via your user account.</p>
    <p>We invite you to consult these social media networks’ policies on the protection of private life to become more aware of the uses of navigation information, mainly for advertising purposes, gathered through these application buttons.</p>
    <p>These cookies do not last longer than 13 months.</p><h3 id="section092_h3">Your preferences on cookie placement</h3><p>When you access the Site or use the Application, you have the possibility of adjusting the settings for cookie placement on your Terminal, notably via the information banner appearing when you access the Site.</p>
    <p>You can prevent the placement of all cookies except technical cookies essential to the functioning of the Site, or you can manually prevent the placement of each type.</p>
    <p>You also have the following options for managing cookie types:</p><h4>1. Cookie settings in your browser</h4><p>Ringover’s website does not respond to “Do not Track” signals.</p>
    <p>Depending on the browser, the User has the following options: accept or reject cookies of all types and origins or program a pop-up window asking for User permission each time a cookie is placed on the Terminal.</p>
    <p>To refine or review options, Users can refer to the help menu or the dedicated section of their browser:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Internet Explorer™: http://windows.microsoft.com/fr-FR/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies</li>

    <li>Opera: https://help.opera.com/fr/Windows/10.20/fr/cookies.html</li>
    </ul><h4>2. Mobile terminal cookie settings</h4><p>On mobile devices, the placement of advertising cookies can be modified directly in the Terminal’s settings.</p>
    <p>You’ll find information on the steps to follow for the main mobile operating systems:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Apple / IOS: 1. Settings / 2. Privacy / 3. Advertising / 4. Disable "Limited Advertising Tracking" to disable iAd Tracking (Apple’s Ad Network)</li>
    <li>Android: 1. Open / 2. Account or Sync (depending on your device) / 3. Google / 4. Privacy or Announcement (depending on your device) / 5. Click “Deactivate interest-based ads”</li>
    <li>Windows: 1. Settings / 2. Ads Settings / 3. Edit Options</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>The procedures described above are those existing at the time of the initial writing of this Privacy Policy; operators of these operating systems may at any time modify the procedures to access these settings. Ringover will have no responsibility to update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in third party procedures.</em></p>                </div>
