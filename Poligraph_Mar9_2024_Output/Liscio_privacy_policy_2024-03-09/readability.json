As we add new features to the Services, we may amend this Privacy Policy. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy that reduces your privacy rights, we will notify you in advance through the Services. Your continued use of the Services after the Effective Date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. The amended Privacy Policy supersedes all previous versions.</p><p><span>Information we collect</span><br>When you use the Services, we collect two types of information: Personal Information and Usage Data.</p><p>In this Privacy Policy, \u201cPersonal Information\u201d means any information that identifies or could be used to identify an individual. Personal Information does not include aggregated information to the extent that an individual\u2019s identity cannot be derived from it. Personal Information includes your contact data (name, telephone number, email address and country of residence) and certain (but not all) Usage Data.</p><p>We define \u201cUsage Data\u201d as information about an individual\u2019s activity on or through the Services that, by itself, does not identify the individual, such as browser type, operating system and webpages visited. Generally, we do not consider Usage Data as Personal Information because Usage Data by itself usually does not identify an individual. Usage Data may, however, be Personal Information under certain laws because it could be used to indirectly identify an individual.</p><p><span>How we collect information<br></span>When you Use the Services: When you subscribe to or otherwise use the Services, we collect business information, such as names, business names, business addresses, email addresses, business phone numbers and any other information that you provide us. We may from time to time conduct surveys to better understand the needs and profiles of our users. You may choose whether to participate in any survey.</p><p>We also collect information through our server logs. A server log is a list of the activities that a server performs. Liscio\u2019s servers automatically collect and store in server logs your search queries, Internet Protocol (IP) address, hardware type, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL and certain cookies that identify your browser or Liscio account.</p><p>We collect information about your computer, tablet or mobile telephone (\u201cDevice\u201c), such as device ID, model, operating system version, mobile network information, telephone number, internet service provider and similar identifiers. Liscio may associate your Device information with your Liscio account. We may collect and store information (including Personal Information) on your Device through browser web and web application data caches.</p><p>Liscio offers mobile applications (\u201cApps\u201c). Liscio collects information about your use of and interaction with the App, such as your Device\u2019s operating system, browser type, domain, search queries, the country and time zone in which your Device is located.</p><p><span>Through Service Providers:</span> Third parties that assist us with our business operations also collect information through the Services. For example, service providers collect information to help us detect and prevent fraud.</p><p><span>Through Data Collection Technology:</span> We use cookies, pixel tabs (also known as web beacons, flash cookies and clear GIFs) and similar technology (\u201cData Collection Technology\u201c) to automatically collect information about you when you use the Services. Please read below to learn more about how Liscio uses Data Collection Technology.</p><p><span>Information from Integrated Sign-On Services:</span> If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party integrated service (what we call an \u201cIntegrated Service\u201d), such as Google or Microsoft Office 365, or similar single sign-on service, we will collect the name and email address that are already associated with your Integrated Service account. You may also have the option of sharing additional information with Liscio through an Integrated Service, as controlled through your settings on that Integrated Service. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, we will treat the information as Personal Information and will use it in the ways described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p><span>Google API Services User Data Policy</span><br>Liscio\u2019s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes\"><strong>Google API Services User Data Policy</strong></a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p><p><span>Cookies and other data collection technology</span><br>Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer\u2019s hard drive. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the \u201clifetime\u201d of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your computer, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using the Services. A web beacon (also called a pixel tag or clear GIF) is a piece of computer code that enables us to monitor user activity and website traffic. To learn more about cookies and web beacons, visit <a href=\"https://allaboutcookies.org/\"><strong>www.allaboutcookies.org</strong></a>.</p><p><span>How We Use Data Collection Technology: </span><br>Data Collection Technology helps us improve your experience of the Services by, for example, storing your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Services, measuring the success of marketing campaigns, compiling statistics about use of the Services and helping us analyze technical and navigational information about the Services and to detect and prevent fraud.</p><p><span>The Services use the following cookies:</span><br>Strictly necessary cookies, which are required for the operation of the Services. Without them, for example, you would not be able to register or log in for the Services that we may offer.Analytical/performance cookies, which allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors, to learn how visitors navigate the Services and to help us to improve the way Services function. Functionality cookies, which are used to recognize you when you return to the Services.We also use Google Analytics which is a Google service that uses Data Collection Technology to collect anonymous information about use of the Services and report website trends. Google Analytics does not identify individual users. We may use an enhancement to Google Analytics called \u201cDemographics and Interest Reporting,\u201d through which Google provides us with information about our users\u2019 demographics (e.g., age, gender) and interests. This information, which Google may collect by tracking a user\u2019s behavior across third-party websites, helps us to learn more about our users. You can learn about Google\u2019s practices in connection with this enhanced tracking and opt out of it by visiting <a href=\"https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated\"><strong>www.adssettings.google.com/authenticated</strong></a> or by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at <a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\"><strong>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</strong></a>.</p><p>We also may use other Data Collection Technology to collect information from the computer or device that you use to access the Services, such as your operating system type, browser type, and domain, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone in which your computer or device is located. We do this to improve the quality of the services we offer.</p><p><span>Your Control of Cookies: </span><br>Some web browsers (including some mobile web browsers) provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. You also may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required to accept cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Services.</p><p><span>Our Policy On Do Not Track Signals: </span><br>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (\u201cDNT\u201c) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain Personal Information about the browser\u2019s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including Liscio, do not respond to DNT signals.</p><p><span>How Liscio processes Personal Information:</span><br>To set up and maintain your registration with the Services;<br>To communicate with you;<br>To prevent and investigate fraud and other misuses of the Services;<br>To protect our rights and property;<br>To operate, manage, secure and improve the Services;<br>To respond to your questions and to try to resolve problems with one of our products;<br>To complete transactions requested by you;<br>To help us improve our customer service.<br>\u200d<br><span>Why Liscio processes Usage Data:</span><br>To analyze trends and gather broad aggregate demographic information;<br>To statistically monitor how many people are using the Services;<br>To develop, improve and protect the Services;<br>For audience research;<br>To audit and analyze the Services; <br>To ensure the technical functionality and security of the Services</p><p><span>How we share information</span><br>Liscio may share Personal Information collected via the Services as follows:Service Providers: We share information with our third-party service providers that help us operate the Services, such as by providing customer service or product support or testing and hardening our security measures.
