For example, the data processed on Modjo is encrypted.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, we strive to maintain 24-hour system monitoring to ensure the security of the personal data entrusted to us.</p><p>Our sites are regularly scanned for security holes and vulnerabilities and we take precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of personal data.</p><p>When certain services require the use of a third party (subcontractor), RINGO selects its service providers on the basis of strict security and confidentiality criteria defined in advance with regard to the issues at stake, and systematically requires its subcontractors to have a level of security that guarantees an adequate level of protection of the personal data they process on our behalf.</p><h2>Who are the recipients of the data we process?</h2><p>Only persons authorized by RINGO may access data, and then only in the context of the tasks entrusted to them. Thus, the only potential recipients of personal data are authorized RINGO employees and subcontractors offering a sufficient level of security. These include the Recall subcontractor, which enables RINGO to record calls, the OpenAI subcontractor, which enables RINGO to generate intelligent summaries of recordings, to automatically segment recordings into chapters, intelligent scoring, and the Deepl subcontractor, which provides translations of recordings.&nbsp;</p><p>In the context of its commercial prospecting operations, RINGO may share with a partner the names of client companies or prospects (legal entities) that they have in common. This does not include the identity and contact data of the contacts.</p><p>In the course of recruiting, RINGO may share candidate information with outside organizations involved in recruiting candidates (subcontractors) such as recruiting firms or SaaS-based recruitment software.</p><h2>What are the retention periods for the personal data collected?</h2><p>RINGO undertakes to keep the personal data entrusted to it for periods limited to the provision of the services or necessary to meet its contractual or legal obligations. </p><p>In particular:</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/600ede9679c6718e9502aae8/6421b9d4785b45f501d42efa_image%20(41).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div></figure><h2>Is your personal data transferred to countries outside the European Union?</h2><p>With regard to hosting and data storage, RINGO requires its hosting service providers to host the data entrusted to it in France. Thus, RINGO's sites and databases are hosted by AWS on servers located in France and in the European Union.</p><p>If, for technical reasons or for specific needs related to the maintenance of certain applications, personal data are transmitted or made accessible to RINGO's service providers located outside the European Union, RINGO will first ensure that these service providers guarantee an adequate level of protection of such data and comply with the GDPR. </p><p>Thus, RINGO only uses subcontractors with an adequate level of security and data protection, for example through the supervision of data transfers outside the EU by binding corporate rules or through the adoption of the European Commission's standard contractual clauses.
