Once we have received your Personal Information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p><p>Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. &nbsp;We will implement adequate safeguards to protect your Personal Information prior to any such transfers. </p><p>‍</p><h3>6.

If you completely delete all such information, then your Account may become deactivated. If you request to terminate your Account, we will retain the Personal Information in case you would like to reactivate your Account in the future. If you would like us to delete your Personal Information in our system, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@touchcast.com">support@touchcast.com</a> with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database.

Your rights (EEA Users Only)</h3><p>You have a number of rights in relation to how we process your Personal Information. &nbsp;These include:</p><ul role="list"><li>the right to access the Personal Information that we may hold about you;</li><li>the right to rectify any inaccurate Personal Information that we may hold about you;</li><li>the right to have your Personal Information erased in certain circumstances, for example, where it is no longer necessary for us to process your Personal Information to fulfil our processing purposes; or where you have exercised your right to object to the processing; </li><li>the right to restrict the processing of your Personal Information where, for example, the information is inaccurate or it is no longer necessary for us to process such information or where you have exercised your right to object to our processing;</li><li>the right to object to the processing of your Personal Information which may be exercised in certain circumstances, for example, where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, or where your own legitimate interests outweigh ours; and </li><li>the right to have your data ported to a new service provider if you no longer wish to use the Services.</li></ul><p>You can exercise any of these rights any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@touchcast.com">support@touchcast.com</a>.</p><p>Users in other jurisdictions may have similar rights, which shall be exercisable by contacting us.</p><p><strong>No fee usually required.</strong></p><p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><p><strong>What we may need from you.</strong></p><p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><p><strong>Time limit to respond.</strong></p><p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p><p>‍</p><h3>8. Retention</h3><p>We will only retain your personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, as set out in this Policy.</p><p>To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal Information, the purposes for which we process your personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p><p>For further information on retention periods, please contact us using the details provided at the end of this Policy. </p><p>‍</p><h3>9. Security</h3><p>TouchCast uses commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and TouchCast reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. </p><p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your Personal Information to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Site or via the application in the most expedient time possible and without undue delay. Where permitted, we may delay making such a notification in: (i) to meet the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) to impose any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p><p>‍</p><h3>10. Other Websites &nbsp;</h3><p>Our Services may contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.
