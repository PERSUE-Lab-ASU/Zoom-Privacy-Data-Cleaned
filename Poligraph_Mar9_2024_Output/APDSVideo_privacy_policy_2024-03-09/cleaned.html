    *All Terms Used In this American Prison Data Systems, PBC (“<b>APDS</b>” or “<b>We</b>”) Privacy Policy
    (“<b>Privacy Policy</b>”)
    unless otherwise defined herein are as defined in the APDS Terms of Service (the “<b>Terms of Use</b>”) to which
    this
    Privacy Policy is linked and which is incorporated herein by reference.
</i>
<br><br>
<strong class="policy-bold"><u>Introduction</u></strong>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the services provided by APDS, which services may be used by individuals
in restrictive custody (“Learners”), the administrators (“Administrators”) and staff (“Facility Personnel”) of the
facility in which the Learners are held in custody (the “Facility”), family, friends and other individuals
authorized to communicate with Learners (collectively, “Family”), law enforcement personnel (“Law Enforcement”),
attorneys representing Learners (“Attorneys” and collectively with Learners, Administrators, Facility Personnel,
Family, and Law Enforcement, the “Authorized Users”). Services include, without limitation, APDS’ hosted software
platform, mobile and desktop applications, websites and related services (collectively, the
“<i><b>Software</b></i>”), hardware,
and documentation (the “<i><b>Documentation</b></i>”) and other digital content, software applications, technology
services,
hosted websites, and secure hardware solutions for correctional institutions known as the “APDS Technology Suite”
(collectively, the “<i><b>Services</b></i>”).
<br><br>
<strong class="policy-bold">Except for specifically designated functions of the Services which explicitly
    state that content is designated and
    approved by Authorities as “Private” or “Attorney-Client Privileged” and are graphically indicated as such in a
    manner acceptable to APDS and the relevant Authorities, all content, messages, emails, text, audio, video, or
    graphics transmitted through the Services (“Content”) is subject to review by the relevant Authorities, and may
    be
    rejected as inappropriate at the sole discretion of any relevant Authority or APDS</strong>. As used herein,
“<b>Authority</b>”
shall mean the prison, jail, corrections, educational or other institution or other law enforcement or governmental
authority or agency providing Users with access to the Services.
<br><br>
<strong class="policy-bold">
    APDS does not guarantee transmission of any Content, even if you have paid APDS as consideration for
    transmitting Content to an individual whose internet use is restricted by the criminal justice system (a
    “Restricted Individual”) who has been approved to be registered as an authorized user of the Services (an
    “Authorized User”).
</strong>
<br><br>
You acknowledge and agree that the Services may include communications from APDS including, but not limited to,
administrative messages and service announcements. You enable these communications upon your registration for the
Services, and you are not permitted to opt out of receiving them while you have a registered account on the
Services. From time to time, we may send you special offers or other marketing communications about our services, or
those of our partners. You may opt out of these messages.
<br><br>
Subject to and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at APDS we respect the privacy of those that access
the Services (“<strong class="policy-bold">Users</strong>”) and are committed to protecting it through our
compliance with this Privacy Policy. To the
extent your information will be held by APDS and not an applicable legal authority, we understand that we have a
responsibility to protect and respect your privacy and look after your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains
what personal data we collect.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy has been developed with a view to compliance with laws regulating privacy upon those providing
limited online services to Restricted Individuals incarcerated at a corrections facility, including emancipated
minors and juveniles ages 13 through 17 years (“<strong class="policy-bold">Juveniles</strong>”) and under
correctional control with the consent of their
applicable Authority (each an “<strong class="policy-bold">Applicable Authority</strong>”) to use the Services and
as permitted by law. We do not provide
access to or market our Services to any minor under the age of 13, and as such we do not collect any Data (as
defined below) of minors under the age of 13.
<br><br>
In order to use the Services subject to this Privacy Policy you must obtain approval and remain approved by the
Applicable Authorities. If at any time, for any reason, you lose the approval of the Applicable Authority to
communicate with a given Restricted Individual, APDS will sever your connection with that individual. If the
approval was rescinded because of misuse of the Services, your User-generated Content (defined <a href="#data-you-provide-to-us">here</a>) may be turned over to the Applicable Authorities for their determination whether
it should be disclosed or deleted.
<br><br>
This policy describes the types of data , including but not limited to, Restricted Individual data, metadata and
User Generated Content as well as all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other non-public information we
may collect from you or that you may provide to us (“<strong class="policy-bold"><i>Data</i></strong>”) when you use
the Services including, but not limited to,
your use of an Internet browser or Mobile Application to visit the APDS-hosted websites located at
connectedcorrections.com, nationalcorrectionsradio.com, nationalcorrectionslibrary.com,
nationalcorrectionsworks.com, apds-services.com, apds.works or a website designated by your Applicable Authority
(the&nbsp;"<strong class="policy-bold"><i>Website(s)</i></strong>") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining,
protecting and disclosing that Data.
<br><br>
This policy applies to Data we collect:
<div class="content-links-sub-paragraph">

        <br>
        <li>When you use our Services for video communications, which may result in recordings that are retained by

        <br>
        <li>When you interact with any APDS authorized partner, affiliate or Applicable Authority under contract
            with APDS and any Data and applications on third-party websites and services.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
It does not apply to Data collected by:

<div class="content-links-sub-paragraph">
    <ul>
        <li>through any other means, including on any other website operated by a Facility under the control of an
            Applicable Authority or by APDS or any third party (including any APDS authorized partner, affiliate or
            Applicable Authority under contract with APDS); or</li>
        <br>
        <li>any third party (including any APDS authorized partner, affiliate or Applicable Authority under contract

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your Data and how we
will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Services. By
submitting a registered Authorized User Account, accessing any of our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. APDS will not change how Data is collected, used, or shared under
the Terms of Use an Authorized User will execute or this Privacy Policy in any way without advance notice to the
Applicable Authority. Your continued use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those
changes, so please check with your Applicable Authority and review this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.

    <u>
        Important Notice for Restricted Individuals as Authorized Users Given Access Through an Applicable Authority
    </u>
</strong>
<br><br>
The APDS Technology Suite products and services that comprise the Services provide a proprietary suite of
correctional technology solutions designed to improve safety for corrections personnel and Restricted Individuals,
while also contributing to better Restricted Individual outcomes by facilitating the delivery of digital curricula,
programs and services via its proprietary technology. APDS’ Website platform is designed specifically to meet the
needs of Restricted Individuals and as such the Services are used by many corrections systems and
corrections-affiliated educational organizations throughout the United States. If you are an Authorized User who was
given access to the Services by the prison, jail, corrections educational institution or other law enforcement or
Applicable Authority in whose custody or control you have been placed, this Privacy Policy does not govern your
Applicable Authority’s collection, use, or disclosure of Data through the Website or Services. We are not
responsible for your Applicable Authority’s collection, use, or disclosure of your Data. Please contact your
Applicable Authority to better understand their privacy practices.
<br><br>
APDS does, however, serve as a repository to retain Data we process on behalf of the Applicable Authority for as
long as needed to provide the Services, and we may disclose such Data if we believe such disclosure is necessary to
(a) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process; or (b) resolve disputes or protect or
defend the rights, safety, or property of APDS, Users of our Services, or any person, including to enforce our
agreements, policies, and the Terms of Use, or (c) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of any person
(collectively, “a”, “b” and “c”, “<string class="policy-bold">Enforcement Purposes</string>”).
<br><br>
APDS may use de-identified Data for product development, research, or other purposes. De-identified Data will have
all direct and indirect personal identifiers removed. This includes, but is not limited to, name, ID numbers, date
of birth, demographic information, location information, and Applicable Authority ID. Furthermore, APDS agrees not
to attempt to re-identify de-identified Data and not to transfer de-identified Data to any party unless that party
agrees not to attempt re-identification. APDS uses only de-identified and aggregated data for its own purposes and
APDS will not use any Data it collects to advertise or market third-party products or services directly to
Restricted Individuals, or their parents if the Restricted Individuals are Juveniles involved as students in
educational programs provided through the Services, and does not sell or share for marketing purposes without the
consent of the Applicable Authority any of the Data it collects other than on a de-identified aggregate basis to
show outcomes of educational programs used for the Services and the benefits of the Services to other correctional
institutions similar to a Facility under the control of the Applicable Authority.
<br><br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, access to identifiable Data may be provided to program staff designated by the
Applicable Authority to assist in providing educational and therapeutic services to Restricted Individuals. In
addition, APDS may use identifiable Data to support its efforts to track the efficacy of programs provided as part
of the Services. APDS is prohibited from mining Data for any purposes other than those agreed to by APDS and the
Applicable Authority. Data may not be used for any purpose other than the specific purpose(s) outlined in this
Privacy Policy.

        Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Data

You may be provided with certain mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your Data:
<br><br>
<div class="content-links-sub-paragraph">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong class="policy-bold">Mobile Device Tracking Technologies and Geolocation Data.</strong>&nbsp; Your
            mobile device may have certain settings that relate to the Applications Programming Interface or “API”
            that allows mobile applications or “apps” to access standard categories of content on a mobile device,
            but also sensitive content such as geolocation information. It is suggested by organizations responsible
            for the protection of consumer privacy interests, such as the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) that
            consumers should familiarize themselves with the privacy setting options available on their mobile
            devices to determine what information may be collected or tracked by certain applications and what steps
            can be taken to control that access, collection or tracking. Pursuant to our agreement with the
            Applicable Authority, due to the correctional institution environment in which the Services are used,
            each APDS provided device issued to a Restricted Individual has been locked and access to such privacy
            settings and related operating functions disabled.
            <strong class="policy-bold">No Authorized User is permitted to access, alter, reverse engineer, hack or
                change any settings for privacy, access, collection, tracking, communications, or other functions
                related to the operation of the Services. Any violation of the preceding sentence shall be grounds
                for immediate termination of your Authorized User Account by APDS or the Applicable
                Authority.</strong>
            Any questions regarding these matters should be made to your Applicable Authority to review the type of
            data collected by our Services, to be forwarded to APDS by the Applicable Authority if the Applicable
            Authority determines the question relevant to a Restricted Individual’s use of the Services as an
            Authorized User. For further information about these privacy settings or on data collected specific to

            If you have an Authorized User Account, unless you are an administrative Authorized User, you may only
            change the personal Data in your account with the written approval and consent of the Applicable
            Authority which approved your original registration for your Authorized User Account. Upon providing
            APDS with verification of such approval to the satisfaction of APDS in its sole discretion, you may make
            such changes by logging into our Services and following the specified procedures. You may also contact
            your Applicable Authority to ask them to discuss with us any request you may have so long as you remain
            an Authorized User to request access to, correct or delete any PI that you have provided to us. We will
            respond to the Applicable Authority about your request, when permitted by law, within 30 days. We cannot
            delete your personal information except by also deleting your Authorized User Account, with the consent
            and approval of the Applicable Authority responsible for providing approval for your Authorized User
            Account. We may not accommodate a request to change any Authorized User profile or Authorized User
            account data if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the Data to be
            incorrect. APDS will ensure that all Data in its possession and in the possession of any subcontractors
            or agents to which APDS may have transferred Data are destroyed or transferred to the Applicable
            Authority under the direction of the Applicable Authority when the Data are no longer needed for their
            specified purpose, at the request of the Applicable Authority.

        APDS’ Biometric Information Privacy Policy
    </strong>
</center>
<br><br>
<strong class="policy-bold">
    Last Modified:
</strong>
August 5, 2022
<br><br>
Please read this policy carefully to understand the nature of the biometric information which may be collected or
transmitted through APDS’ technology, as well as the retention and destruction practices of APDS.
<br><br>
For purposes of this Biometric Information Privacy Policy, “Biometric Data” means any individual’s biometric
identifier and/or information based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify that person, regardless
of how it is captured, converted, stored or shared. A biometric identifier can include fingerprints, finger scans,
voice recognition hand scans or face geometry/scans.
<br><br>
<strong class="policy-bold">
    Retention &amp; Destruction:
</strong>
<br>
<br>
APDS has developed this policy to inform the Users of our Services of the nature of the potential Biometric Data
that it may collect, receive, use, store, capture or otherwise obtain, as well as the purpose for which the
information is obtained and the retention and destruction procedures in place for Biometric Data. APDS’ technology
may collect, receive, obtain, store and use an image of an individual’s hand, finger, face or voice or data derived
or extracted from a mathematical formula/algorithm from such image, specifically the use of facial recognition to
log into our Learner Portal. Though it may or may not be subject to the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act
(“BIPA”), 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq., APDS nevertheless elects to provide this policy out of an abundance of caution
pursuant to and in accordance with Illinois law.
<br><br>
Potential Biometric Data will be transmitted and stored using a reasonable standard of care for APDS’ industry and
in a manner that is the same or exceeds the standards used to protect other confidential information held by APDS,
including Social Security numbers, protected health information, etc. APDS will delete or destroy potential
Biometric Data every ninety (90) days.
<br><br>
APDS will not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from an individual’s Biometric Data. The potential Biometric
Data that could be collected, received, used, stored, captured or otherwise obtained through the APDS system would
only be shared between the User, APDS, the Applicable Authority, and any third parties with whom APDS contracts for
the provision of its services. The potential Biometric Data will not be disclosed by APDS to third parties or other
users unrelated to the User unless: (a) consent is obtained; (b) disclosure is required by law; or (c) disclosure is
required by subpoena.
<br><br>
APDS reserves the right to amend this Biometric Information Security Policy at any time.
