A biometric identifier can include fingerprints, finger scans,\nvoice recognition hand scans or face geometry/scans.\n\n\n    Retention & Destruction:\n\n\nAPDS has developed this policy to inform the Users of our Services of the nature of the potential Biometric Data\nthat it may collect, receive, use, store, capture or otherwise obtain, as well as the purpose for which the\ninformation is obtained and the retention and destruction procedures in place for Biometric Data. APDS\u2019 technology\nmay collect, receive, obtain, store and use an image of an individual\u2019s hand, finger, face or voice or data derived\nor extracted from a mathematical formula/algorithm from such image, specifically the use of facial recognition to\nlog into our Learner Portal.
