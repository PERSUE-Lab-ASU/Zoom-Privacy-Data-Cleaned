<div><br></div>
<hr>
<h2><br></h2>
<h2>4. Information from cookies and similar tracking technologies</h2>
<p>Cookies are stored on your device to assist us in providing and improving our Services. For example, we may use cookies to keep you logged into your account and we may use data collection devices such as Google Analytics to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness and to provide you with information relevant to your interests.</p>
<p>Through first-party and third-party cookies, third parties may collect information about you while you are visiting Enginehire-hosted webpages and other websites. They may use this data to show you advertisements on Enginehire-hosted webpages and across the Internet based on your prior visits to these sites. We do not collect this information or control the content of the advertisements that you will see.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>We use cookies to recognize your device and provide you with a personalized experience on our websites, or otherwise through the Services.</li>
<li>We use cookies to serve targeted ads from Google, Facebook, Bing, SourceKnowledge, and other third-party vendors. We also use cookies, and other information from your browser and/or device to provide you with personalized advertising, ad delivery, and reporting across multiple sessions and devices.</li>
<li>Our third-party advertising partners use cookies to track your prior visits to our websites and elsewhere on the Internet in order to serve you targeted ads. For more information about targeted or behavioral advertising, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising</a>.</li>
<li>We may also use web beacons, software development kits, and other automated tracking methods on our websites, in communications with you, and in our products and services, to measure performance and engagement.</li>

<h2><br></h2>
<h2>5. Third party apps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enginehire’s platform allows businesses to connect their platforms with third party applications to alter or provide new functionalities in their platform.&nbsp;Enginehire is not responsible for and has no control over how these apps function. Businesses ultimately can control which apps they choose to use with their platform, and are responsible for making sure that they do so in compliance with relevant privacy and data protection requirements.</li>
<li>Enginehire is not currently sharing any user data with Google AI models.</li>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<p><br></p>
<hr>
<h2><br></h2>
<h2>6. Retention and use of&nbsp;information</h2>
<ul>
<li>In general, we keep your&nbsp;information throughout your relationship with us. For businesses, this means we will keep your information as long as you maintain a website on our platform. We generally purge personal information 90 days after&nbsp;termination of your relationship with us.</li>
<li>For our business’ customers, we generally process your information solely as a data processor on behalf of our businesses, and it is up to the business to determine how long they will store your information in our systems.</li>
<li>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.</li>
<li>We do not share, disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide personal information to other companies (other than to specific Enginehire businesses you are interacting with, or to third party apps or service providers being used by those businesses if you are a consumer) for the marketing of their own products or services.</li>
<li>If you are a business using Enginehire’s Services, we do not use the personal information we collect from you or your customers to independently contact or market to your customers. However, Enginehire may contact or market to your customers if we obtain their information from another source, such as from the customers themselves.</li>
<li>Once you terminate your relationship with us, we generally will continue to store archived copies of your personal information for legitimate business purposes such as to defend a contractual claim or for audit purposes and to comply with the law.</li>
<li>We will continue to store anonymous or anonymized information, such as website visits, without identifiers, in order to improve our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to remember that if you delete or limit the use of your information, the Services may not function properly.</p>
