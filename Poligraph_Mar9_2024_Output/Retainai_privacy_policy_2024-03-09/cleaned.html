<p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains what information Retain AI, Inc. (“Retain”, “Retain.ai”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects from our users (“users” or “you”) and how we use and share this information. This Policy applies to your use of any services, products, content or software made available by Retain, including but not limited to Retain’s website (the “Site”) currently located at retain.ai (collectively, the “Retain Platform”). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information.</p>



<p>Retain complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.Privacy Shield &nbsp;Framework(s) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Retain has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. &nbsp;If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. &nbsp;To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.​</p>



<p>Retain may change this Policy from time to time. &nbsp;If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and posting the new policy on the Site. &nbsp;We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Site or use the Retain Platform in any way to stay informed about our information practices. &nbsp;Your continued use of the Retain Platform constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Users Outside the United States</h3>



<p>The Site is hosted in the United States and is governed by United States law. If you are outside the United States when you visit the Site or engage in communications with a Retain agent via mail, e-mail or telephone, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Site and/or communicating with a Retain agent via mail, email or telephone, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities in the United States and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Information We Collect</h3>



<p>Visitors:&nbsp;&nbsp;We collect information if you visit our Site or use the Retain Platform, even if you do not establish an account with Retain. &nbsp;This information includes: &nbsp;IP address, geographic location (country based on IP address), browser type, version and language setting and operating system type, version and language setting.</p>



<p>Account Creation and Use of Retain Platform:&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the information above, we collect your email address when you create an account with Retain.</p>



<p>Cookies and Web Beacons: &nbsp;We use “cookies” and “web beacons” to collect information for various purposes. &nbsp;A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer or mobile device’s hard disk. &nbsp;We use cookies, for example, to save your login information in order to authenticate you as a customer. &nbsp;A web beacon is an electronic image that may be used on the Site or in email to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and actioned. &nbsp;We also use both cookies and web beacons for the purpose of collecting information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Retain Platform.</p>



<p>User Data: We collect information you voluntarily provide to us in the process of using the Retain Platform. &nbsp;This includes data provided to us through third party integrations. &nbsp;We process such data on your behalf in accordance with the instructions received from you for as long as needed to provide our services, subject to this Policy.</p>



<p>Google APIs:&nbsp;We collect only the information that you authorize us to collect when you authenticate into Retain.ai using Google’s OAuth API. Retain.ai requires the following permissions to offer a base level of functionality:</p>



<ul>
<li>Access to your calendar, in order to understand which external interactions you participate in</li>



<li>Read-only access to your coworkers’ calendar, if shared with you, in order to understand which external interactions they participate in</li>



<li>Access the names, emails and avatars of contacts in your organization in order to identify the co-workers whose calendars we should include in our analysis</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the base functionality, you may also grant the following permissions to extend the coverage provided&nbsp;by Retain:</p>



<ul>
<li>Read-only access to Gmail metadata, which will be used&nbsp;exclusively&nbsp;in order to estimate and report time spent on email activities with external parties</li>



<li>Read-only access to Drive, which will be used exclusively in order to estimate and report time spent on documents related to external parties</li>
</ul>



<p>In both cases, the information collected may include personal information identifiers, typically in the form of email addresses and first and last names retrieved via an API. This information is used exclusively for the purposes of the service, such as attributing activity to the appropriate account based on an email sender’s domain.</p>



<p>Other Integrations:&nbsp;In using the Retain service you may elect to transfer data, programmatically&nbsp;or otherwise, from other applications to Retain; in that case, personal information residing in those platform, such as email or first and last name, may be collected&nbsp;by Retain if it is deemed necessary for the purpose of delivering the service to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chrome Browser Extension:&nbsp;If you choose to install the Retain Chrome Browser Extension, you will be asked to grant access to information that will be used to associate time spent on specific&nbsp;websites, such as Facebook Ads Manager,&nbsp;with external parties. The extension requires access to your tabs in order to understand how much time is spent on each page. In a limited number of cases, we may&nbsp;request access to the contents of&nbsp;webpages on specific domains, exclusively in order to attribute time spent on a site to a specific external party, based on the content of the page.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">​Google API Services Usage Disclosure</h3>



<p>​Retain’s use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How We Use Information</h3>

<li>When we believe that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants or court orders;</li>

<li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of Retain, our users, or others; and</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Third Parties</h3>



<p>We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies in the Retain Platform. These companies may collect information such as IP address, browser type, domain name, access time, URL and page views. &nbsp;This information may be used to analyze your use of the Retain Platform and to assist us with product and business process improvements.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Security</h3>



<p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information collected and maintained through the Retain Platform. &nbsp;However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us or guarantee that information on the Retain Platform may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized persons.</p>
