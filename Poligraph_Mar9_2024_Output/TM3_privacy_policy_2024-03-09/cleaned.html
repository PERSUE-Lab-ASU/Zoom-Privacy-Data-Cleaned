Our legal grounds for processing your Personal Data<br></strong></span><br>2.1.	Where we are acting as a data controller:<br><br><span class="text-span-20">2.1.1.	we may process your personal data to enable us to comply with any instructions you give to us or any obligations we owe to you including enabling us to perform a contract with you or to comply with our legal obligations. </span><br><br><span class="text-span-21">2.1.2.	we may also process your personal data for the purposes of our own legitimate interests (provided that those interests do not override any of your own interests, rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data). This includes processing for statistical, management and business development purposes, for example seeking your thoughts and opinions on the services we provide to you and notifying you about any changes to our products and services. &nbsp;It may also include processing for marketing purposes, such as providing you with information related to any our products or services which we think may interest you (subject to your rights set out in section 3). </span><br><br><span class="text-span-22">2.1.3.	we may also process your personal data for other purposes but (unless this is in circumstances where the reason for doing so is compatible with the original purpose or we have other lawful grounds for doing so) this will usually only happen where we have obtained your specific consent. &nbsp;If that is the case, then you also have the right to withdraw your consent, which you can do by contacting us in writing at the address set out in section 8. </span><br><br><span class="text-span-23">2.1.4.	Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. &nbsp;</span><br><br>2.2.	Where we are acting as a data processor:<br><span class="text-span-25"><br>2.2.1.	 the business that has provided your personal information to us is itself responsible for ensuring that it has lawful grounds to do so and for providing us with instructions as to the specific types of personal data we are permitted to process; and</span><span><br></span><br>2.2.2.	the ground(s) upon which that business is entitled to process your personal data is determined by them not us (and may vary from organisation to organisation); and<br><br>2.2.3.	unless Data Protection Legislation requires or permits otherwise, we will process that personal data only in accordance with their instructions and for the purposes of enabling us to perform our obligations under our contract with them.<br><br><span class="text-span-27"><strong>3.	Your individual rights<br></strong> <br></span><span class="text-span-28"><strong>Access to information<br></strong></span><br>3.1.	We want to make sure that you are fully aware of your data protection rights. &nbsp;These are set out in summary form in sections 3.5 - 3.13 below and apply to us in our role as a data controller. &nbsp;You can also obtain more detailed information about your rights under the Data Protection Legislation from the Information Commissioner’s office by clicking on this link - www.ico.org.uk. Our contact details for the purposes of requesting access to your personal data or exercising any of your other data protection rights are in section 8.<br><br>3.2.	Please note that, in order to comply with any request, we may first require you to verify your identity and we will normally fulfil any request by sending information electronically, unless the request expressly specifies a different method. &nbsp;We will not charge a fee for responding to your request, other than in circumstances where you make a request which is manifestly unfounded or excessive or you request further copies of information which we have already provided to you. &nbsp;In that case, we are entitled to charge a reasonable administrative fee. <br><br>3.3.	Please also note that, where we are acting as a data processor, we will not be responsible for answering your request ourselves but will pass it onto the business organisation that provided us with your personal data (in their role as data controller) so that they may then determine how best to respond to it.<br><br><span class="text-span-29"><strong>Timescales for responding</strong><br></span><br>3.4.	If you make a request of us (in our role as a data controller), we will normally have one month to respond to you. &nbsp;If we need something from you to be able to deal with your request (e.g. an ID document), the time limit will begin once we have received this. &nbsp;This time limit may also be extended in certain circumstances so, if there is any reason why our response to you might take longer than a month, we will let you know.<br><br><strong>Summary of your rights</strong><br><br>3.5.	Withdrawal of consent - where our legal ground for processing your personal data is based upon you having given us your consent to do so, you have the right, at any time, to withdraw that consent (please see section 2.1.3 above). &nbsp;Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. &nbsp;<br><br>3.6.	Right to be informed – you are entitled to be provided with information about certain matters relating to the processing of your personal data and for that information to be provided within certain timescales. This privacy policy already provides you with much of that information.<br><br>3.7.	Right of access - you have the right to obtain:<br><br>3.7.1.	confirmation that your personal data is being processed;<br><br>3.7.2.	access to your personal data.<br><br>3.8.	Right to rectification - you are entitled to have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.<br><br>3.9.	Right to erasure – (sometimes referred to as ‘the right to be forgotten’). The broad principle underpinning this right is to enable you to request the deletion or removal of your personal data whether there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.<br><br>3.10.	Right to restrict processing - you are entitled to restrict the processing of your personal data if:<br><br>3.10.1.	you are contesting the accuracy of the personal data (until the accuracy has been verified);<br><br>3.10.2.	you object to the processing, in circumstances where the processing was necessary for the performance of a public interest task or on the grounds of our or someone else’s legitimate interests (whilst we consider whether those legitimate grounds override your interests).3.10.3.	the processing is unlawful but you have decided not to have it erased but requested restriction instead.3.10.4.	if we no longer need the personal data but still have it and you require it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.3.11.	Right to data portability – in certain limited circumstances, you are able to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services by being allowed to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another.3.12.	Right to object - you are entitled to object to:<br><br>3.12.1.	processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);<br><br>3.12.2.	direct marketing (including profiling); and<br><br>3.12.3.	processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.<br><br>3.13.	Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling - these rights don’t apply to all circumstances but, where they do apply, they effectively provide you with safeguards against the risk that a potentially damaging decision is taken solely using or supported by automated means, without human intervention.<br><br><span class="text-span-30"><strong>4.
