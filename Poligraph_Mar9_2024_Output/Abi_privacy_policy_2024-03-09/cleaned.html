Unfortunately, even with these measures, we cannot guarantee the security of PII. By using the Websites, you acknowledge and agree that we make no such guarantee, and that you use the Websites at your own risk.</p><h4 class="text-[22px] leading-[36px] text-gray-900 mt-[35px] font-extrabold">Choice, Access, and Rights</h4><p class="mt-3 text-sm">You may choose not to provide the PII we request. However, not providing the information we request may restrict your ability to use certain features or functionality of the Websites. For example, Users cannot register for an account through the Portal if they do not provide us with their name and email address.</p><p class="mt-3 text-sm">We may seek prior consent for certain processing. Where processing is based on consent, consent may be withdrawn at any time by contacting us at ask@beroe-inc.com. Any withdrawal of consent is only effective on a going-forward basis, and will not impact processing we undertook while relying on a valid consent.</p><p class="mt-3 text-sm">Users that create an account may access and change their PII using the "Change" or "Edit" function by accessing their profile <a href="https://live.beroeinc.com/#/myProfile" class="font-[400] underline text-[#551A8B] visited:text-purple-60"> https://live.beroeinc.com/#/myProfile</a>. If you have questions regarding our use or collection of PII, please contact us at: ask@beroe-inc.com.</p><p class="mt-3 text-sm">If you receive communications from us, you may subsequently opt-out of receiving those communications using the mechanism provided in the communication. Users may affirmatively opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us by sending an email to unsubscribe@beroe-inc.com.</p><p class="mt-3 text-sm">You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies. Not all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser “do not track” signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies. In some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause our websites, games, and applications not to work as intended and some features may not be available.</p><p class="mt-3 text-sm">If you are located in the EU, or a place where EU law applies, you may have additional rights to request access to, correction of, erasure of, or the transfer of your PII, as well as the right to object to or restrict the processing of your PII. You may exercise these rights, if applicable, by contacting us at ask@beroe-inc.com . We will retain your PII for as long as we reasonably need to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. For example, if you register for our Services and create an account, we will store your information for as long as needed to maintain your account, provide the services you request, enforce any applicable terms that govern your use of the services, and maintain appropriate records to reflect our delivery of services to you. Individuals located in the EU, or a place where EU member state law applies, also may have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU or member state supervisory authority.</p><h4 class="text-[22px] leading-[36px] text-gray-900 mt-[35px] font-extrabold">International Data Transfers</h4><p class="mt-3 text-sm">We may store and process information, including through third-party or affiliate hosting services, in the United States, European Economic Area, or any other international jurisdiction. As a result, we may transfer the PII described in this Privacy Policy for the purposes and to the parties described in this Privacy Policy to locations that may be outside of the jurisdiction where you are located. The laws in those jurisdictions may be different than the data protection laws in the jurisdiction in which you reside. Some of these jurisdictions may not have been deemed adequate by the European Commission to provide a comparable level of protection to that of the jurisdiction in which you are located. However, we will treat PII as subject to, and protect it in accordance with, this Privacy Policy. If we transfer PII from the EU to any other party located outside the EU, we will ask for your consent or rely on a legal framework that provides appropriate safeguards, which may include standard contractual clauses or some other framework deemed adequate by the European Commission.</p><h4 class="text-[22px] leading-[36px] text-gray-900 mt-[35px] font-extrabold">Privacy Policy Amendments</h4><p class="mt-3 text-sm">We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or delete portions of this Privacy Policy at any time without further notice. If we do this, we will post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the new effective date (i.e., the LAST UPDATED date). You agree that you will check for new versions of this Privacy Policy. By continuing to access and/or use the Websites or Services following the posting of a new Privacy Policy version, you agree to be bound by the then-current version.
