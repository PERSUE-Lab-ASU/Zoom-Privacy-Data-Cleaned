Users can access the Bigtincan Hub service (the \u201cService\u201d) through our website www.Bigtincan.com, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A \u201cDevice\u201d is any computer used to access the Bigtincan Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of all products and services provided by Bigtincan, regardless of how you access them, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as \u201cinformation.\u201d As indicated by the attached documentation, additional policies apply to Bigtincan\u2019s VoiceVibes and Brainshark products.</p>\n</div><div><h3>1. The Information We Collect And Store</h3>\n<p>We may collect and store the following information when running the Bigtincan Service:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Information You Provide.</em></strong> When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third-party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. You may also provide us with your contacts\u2019 email addresses when sharing folders or files with them. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example, if they have tried to share something with you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Files.</em></strong>&nbsp; We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Bigtincan Service (\u201cFiles\u201d). If you add a file to your Bigtincan Hub that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Log Data.</em></strong> When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device\u2019s Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.</p>\n</div><div><h3>2. How We Use Personal Information</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Personal Information.</em></strong>&nbsp; In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings information.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Geo-Location Information.</em></strong> Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. Some photos and videos you place in Bigtincan Hub may contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. If you do not wish to share files embedded with your geo-location information with us, please do not upload them. If you don\u2019t want to store location data in your photos or videos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that feature. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device\u2019s location.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Analytics.</em></strong> We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service\u2019s technical administration, to increase our Service\u2019s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests.</p>\n</div><div><h3>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Your Use.</em></strong>&nbsp; Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what information you disclose and your desired level of anonymity. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example, if you use a third-party application to access your account (see below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.</em></strong>&nbsp; We may use certain trusted third-party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service\u2019s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Third-Party Applications.</em></strong>&nbsp; We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Bigtincan\u2019s Rights.</em></strong> We may disclose to parties outside Bigtincan Hub files stored in your Bigtincan Hub and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Bigtincan Hub or its users; or (d) to protect Bigtincan\u2019s property rights. If we provide your Bigtincan Hub files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove Bigtincan\u2019s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, Bigtincan will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on Bigtincan Hub.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Business Transfers.</em></strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.</p>\n<p><strong><em><u>Non-private or Non-Personal Information.</u></em></strong>&nbsp; We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service.</p>\n<p>Bigtincan\u2019s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>\n</div><div><h3>4. Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>\n<p>If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing your \u201caccount settings.\u201d If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your account settings. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact <a href=\"mailto:info@Bigtincan.com\">info@Bigtincan.com</a>. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days.</p>\n</div><div><h3>5. Data Retention</h3>\n<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account by contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:info@Bigtincan.com\">info@Bigtincan.com</a>. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.</p>\n</div><div><h3>6. Bigtincan Community</h3>\n<p>Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact <a href=\"mailto:security@bigtincan.com\">security@bigtincan.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Bigtincan. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.</p>\n</div><div><h3>7. Security</h3>\n<p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>\n<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security, you can contact us at <a href=\"mailto:security@bigtincan.com\">security@bigtincan.com</a>.</p>\n</div><div><h3>8. Our Policy Toward Children</h3>\n<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 16. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href=\"mailto:info@Bigtincan.com\">info@Bigtincan.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.</p>\n</div><div><h3>9. GDPR</h3>\n<p>While Bigtincan applies the same level of care to its customers around the world, Bigtincan also complies with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect on May 25, 2018. Specifically, Bigtincan complies with the GDPR requirements by providing its customers with full knowledge of what data is transferred from a customer environment and how Bigtincan encrypts the data, whether it is in transit or at rest, ensuring in accordance with the GDPR that the data would be unintelligible to any person who is not authorized to access it. As a data processor of data provided by our customers, you can learn more about how Bigtincan treats data and complies with the GDPR by reviewing our Data Processing Addendum which is available upon request from Bigtincan. We offer our customers a Data Processing Addendum (DPA), which incorporates the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs,\u201d also known as the EU Model Clauses) and include Bigtincan\u2019s organizational measures. The SCCs are a valid and recognized legal mechanism for ensuring that any personal data leaving the European Economic Area will be transferred in compliance with EU data-protection laws. Bigtincan continues to maintain the operational processes necessary to meet the stringent SCC requirements for the transfer of personal data to processors, which in turn allows us to provide our customers with contractual guarantees for the protection of their personal data. Bigtincan offers a DPA that includes GDPR-specific language to ensure that Bigtincan and our customers have appropriate GDPR-specific contractual provisions in place to allow for the legal transfer of personal data.</p>\n<p>If you have questions regarding either of these statements or to obtain additional documentation, you may view our website or contact us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:gdpr@Bigtincan.com.\">gdpr@Bigtincan.com.</a></p>\n</div><div><h3>10.&nbsp; Contacting Us</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: Level 6, 338 Pitt Street, New South Wales Australia 2000, or&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:security@bigtincan.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">security@bigtincan.com</a>.</p>\n</div><div><h3>11.&nbsp; Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>\n<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>\n</div><div><h2>Privacy Notice for California Residents</h2>\n<p><strong>Effective Date: January 1, 2020</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Last Reviewed on: February 15, 2020</strong></p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements the information contained in Bigtincan\u2019s Privacy policy and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (\u201cconsumers\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d).

It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for your information in these types of transactions, including notifying you if a different company will receive this information. Any successor in a merger or acquisition shall be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-Party Links</strong> \u2013 We may provide links to external websites in order to make certain content and services available to you.

Please be aware that if you disable all cookies or even just the cookies delivered by VoiceVibes, this may impact your ability to use our website as well as others.</p>\n<p><strong>Browser Controls for \u201cDo Not Track\u201d</strong> \u2013 Some newer browsers have \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (DNT) features. When engaged, most DNT features send a signal or preference to websites that you do not want to be tracked. Those websites or their third-party advertisers or content providers may continue to engage in activity you may view as tracking, even after you use the DNT, depending on the websites\u2019 privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, VoiceVibes does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of DNT signals and to remain compliant with industry standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Data That You Direct Us to Share</strong> \u2013 You can direct us to share data with other parties.

VoiceVibes uses the so-called two-click solution. This means that when you visit our Website, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plug- ins. You can recognise the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box above its initial letter or the logo. VoiceVibes offers you the possibility to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. Only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it, the plug-in provider receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding Website of our online offer. In addition, the data mentioned in the section \u201cCollection of personal data when you visit our Website\u201d of this Privacy Policy will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook, the IP address is anonymised immediately after collection, according to the respective provider. By activating the plug-in, personal data is transferred from you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there. Since the plug-in provider collects data mainly via cookies, VoiceVibes recommends that you delete all cookies before clicking on the greyed-out box using your browser\u2019s security settings.</li>\n<li>VoiceVibes has no influence on the data collected and data processing processes, nor is VoiceVibes aware of the full extent of data collection, the purposes of processing, or the storage periods. VoiceVibes does not have information on the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider.</li>\n<li>The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses these for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its Website. Such an evaluation takes place in particular (also for non-logged-in users) for the representation of suitable advertisements and in order to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our Website. You have a right of objection to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right. Through the plug-ins, VoiceVibes offers you the ability to interact with social networks and other users, so that VoiceVibes can improve our service and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.</li>\n<li>The data is passed on regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your data collected with us will be directly assigned to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you click the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. VoiceVibes recommends that you log out regularly after using a social network, especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.</li>\n<li>Further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider can be found in the privacy policy of these providers listed below. They will also provide you with further information about your rights in this regard and how to set options to protect your privacy.</li>\n<li>Addresses of the respective plug-in providers and URLs with their data protection information:<br>\na) LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA;http://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.

In addition, the data mentioned in the section \u201cCollection of personal data when you visit our Website\u201d of this Privacy Policy will be transmitted. This does not depend on whether YouTube provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged into Google, your information will be directly associated with your account. If you do not wish to be associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as user profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such evaluation takes place in particular (even for non-logged-in users) to provide demand- oriented advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our Website.

Where VoiceVibes has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to GDPR, VoiceVibes will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.</p>\n<p><strong>Security.</strong></p>\n<p>VoiceVibes will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Enforcement.</strong></p>\n<p>VoiceVibes will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy. Any employee that VoiceVibes determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p>\n<p><strong>Retention of Personal Information.</strong></p>\n<p>If your VoiceVibes account becomes inactive because it was not timely renewed, and you have not opted in to permit us to retain your personal information, we will keep your personal information for a period of three months prior to beginning the process of deleting it. This will enable us to promptly reactivate your account in the event you renew during the initial three month period.

We use other third parties such as a web-hosting platform who hosts the article comment sections of our sites. When you sign up for our site we will share your name, e-mail address and name as necessary for the third party to provide that service.</p>\n<p>CompareNetworks may share aggregate data about our users with business partners, advertisers or sponsors. Our motivation in doing so is to deliver better content and services to our users. CompareNetworks may carefully select third parties to send users information regarding their products or services unless the user has opted-out as described above.</p>\n<h2>Contests and Sweepstakes</h2>\n<p>CompareNetworks offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name and e-mail address; in some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal data. The information gathered in this manner is used to verify the entrant\u2019s identity, to send the entrant an e-mail notification that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. CompareNetworks may divulge this information to a third party, provided the user gives express consent.

Users can access the Bigtincan Hub service (the \u201cService\u201d) through our website www.Bigtincan.com, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A \u201cDevice\u201d is any computer used to access the Bigtincan Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of all products and services provided by Bigtincan, regardless of how you access them, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as \u201cinformation.\u201d As indicated by the attached documentation, additional policies apply to Bigtincan\u2019s VoiceVibes and Brainshark products.\n1. The Information We Collect And Store\nWe may collect and store the following information when running the Bigtincan Service:\nInformation You Provide. When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third-party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. You may also provide us with your contacts\u2019 email addresses when sharing folders or files with them. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example, if they have tried to share something with you.\nFiles.\u00a0 We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Bigtincan Service (\u201cFiles\u201d). If you add a file to your Bigtincan Hub that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.\nLog Data. When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device\u2019s Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.\n2. How We Use Personal Information\nPersonal Information.\u00a0 In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings information.\nGeo-Location Information. Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. Some photos and videos you place in Bigtincan Hub may contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. If you do not wish to share files embedded with your geo-location information with us, please do not upload them. If you don\u2019t want to store location data in your photos or videos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that feature. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device\u2019s location.\nAnalytics. We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service\u2019s technical administration, to increase our Service\u2019s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests.\n3. Information Sharing and Disclosure\nYour Use.\u00a0 Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what information you disclose and your desired level of anonymity. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example, if you use a third-party application to access your account (see below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.\nService Providers, Business Partners and Others.\u00a0 We may use certain trusted third-party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service\u2019s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.\nThird-Party Applications.\u00a0 We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.\nCompliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Bigtincan\u2019s Rights. We may disclose to parties outside Bigtincan Hub files stored in your Bigtincan Hub and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Bigtincan Hub or its users; or (d) to protect Bigtincan\u2019s property rights. If we provide your Bigtincan Hub files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove Bigtincan\u2019s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, Bigtincan will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on Bigtincan Hub.\nBusiness Transfers. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.\nNon-private or Non-Personal Information.\u00a0 We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service.\nBigtincan\u2019s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.\n4. Changing or Deleting Your Information\nIf you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing your \u201caccount settings.\u201d If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your account settings. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact info@Bigtincan.com. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days.\n5. Data Retention\nWe will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account by contacting us at info@Bigtincan.com. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.\n6. Bigtincan Community\nOur Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact security@bigtincan.com.\nOur Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Bigtincan. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.\n7. Security\nThe security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).\nWe follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security, you can contact us at security@bigtincan.com.\n8. Our Policy Toward Children\nOur Services are not directed to persons under 16. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info@Bigtincan.com. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.\n9. GDPR\nWhile Bigtincan applies the same level of care to its customers around the world, Bigtincan also complies with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect on May 25, 2018. Specifically, Bigtincan complies with the GDPR requirements by providing its customers with full knowledge of what data is transferred from a customer environment and how Bigtincan encrypts the data, whether it is in transit or at rest, ensuring in accordance with the GDPR that the data would be unintelligible to any person who is not authorized to access it. As a data processor of data provided by our customers, you can learn more about how Bigtincan treats data and complies with the GDPR by reviewing our Data Processing Addendum which is available upon request from Bigtincan. We offer our customers a Data Processing Addendum (DPA), which incorporates the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs,\u201d also known as the EU Model Clauses) and include Bigtincan\u2019s organizational measures. The SCCs are a valid and recognized legal mechanism for ensuring that any personal data leaving the European Economic Area will be transferred in compliance with EU data-protection laws. Bigtincan continues to maintain the operational processes necessary to meet the stringent SCC requirements for the transfer of personal data to processors, which in turn allows us to provide our customers with contractual guarantees for the protection of their personal data. Bigtincan offers a DPA that includes GDPR-specific language to ensure that Bigtincan and our customers have appropriate GDPR-specific contractual provisions in place to allow for the legal transfer of personal data.\nIf you have questions regarding either of these statements or to obtain additional documentation, you may view our website or contact us at\u00a0gdpr@Bigtincan.com.\n10.\u00a0 Contacting Us\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: Level 6, 338 Pitt Street, New South Wales Australia 2000, or\u00a0security@bigtincan.com.\n11.\u00a0 Changes to our Privacy Policy\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.\nPrivacy Notice for California Residents\nEffective Date: January 1, 2020\nLast Reviewed on: February 15, 2020\nThis Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements the information contained in Bigtincan\u2019s Privacy policy and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (\u201cconsumers\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d).

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child under the age of 16 has provided us with information without their consent, they should contact the VoiceVibes Privacy Officer at privacyofficer@myvoicevibes.com, and we will delete such information as soon as reasonably practicable.\nInformation on the collection of personal data\n\nPersonal data are all data that make you personally identifiable, e.g. name, address, email addresses, user behaviour.\nWhen you contact us by e-mail or via a contact form, the data you provide (your email address, if applicable, your name and your telephone number) will be saved by us in order to answer your questions. VoiceVibes will delete the data collected in this context when its storage is no longer necessary or restrict the processing if statutory retention obligations exist.\nIf VoiceVibes makes use of contracted service providers for individual functions of our services or would like to use your data for advertising purposes, VoiceVibes will inform you in detail about the respective processes below. VoiceVibes does not directly collect sensitive personal information (e.g. information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political affiliations, etc.), but it is possible that you will provide such information in the content of your voice recordings.\nVoiceVibes will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. VoiceVibes will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.\n\nYour rights\n\nYou have the following rights regarding personal data concerning you:\n\nRight of information,\nRight of correction or deletion,\nRight of limitation of processing,\nRight of opposition to the processing,\nRight of data portability\n\n\nYou also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data.\n\nData Portability\nUpon request, VoiceVibe shall provide individuals with their personal data that has been provided to VoiceVibes in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.\nRight to Erasure\nUpon request, VoiceVibes shall delete an individual\u2019s personal information without undue delay; provided, however, VoiceVibes has the right to retain such personal information as may be necessary for (i) compliance with legal obligations or for a task carried out in the public interest; (ii) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health; (iii) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes if VoiceVibes takes appropriate measures for data minimization that no longer permits the identification of the individual; and (iv) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nTermination/Deactivation\nWhen you terminate or deactivate your VoiceVibes account, data that can identify you will be removed from the VoiceVibes service, and if you consented during sign-up, we can retain your data after your account has been closed, but you are also able to revoke this consent at any time, either before, during or after account closure.\nAccess and Correction\nUpon request, VoiceVibes will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, VoiceVibes will permit individuals to correct, amend, supplement or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate orincomplete. VoiceVibeswillnotifyanythirdpartyagenttowhomthepersonal information has been disclosed that such personal information has been corrected, unless doing so proves to be impossible or involves disproportionate effort.\nUse of social media plug-ins\n\nVoiceVibes currently uses the following social media plug-ins: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube. VoiceVibes uses the so-called two-click solution. This means that when you visit our Website, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plug- ins. You can recognise the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box above its initial letter or the logo. VoiceVibes offers you the possibility to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. Only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it, the plug-in provider receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding Website of our online offer. In addition, the data mentioned in the section \u201cCollection of personal data when you visit our Website\u201d of this Privacy Policy will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook, the IP address is anonymised immediately after collection, according to the respective provider. By activating the plug-in, personal data is transferred from you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there. Since the plug-in provider collects data mainly via cookies, VoiceVibes recommends that you delete all cookies before clicking on the greyed-out box using your browser\u2019s security settings.\nVoiceVibes has no influence on the data collected and data processing processes, nor is VoiceVibes aware of the full extent of data collection, the purposes of processing, or the storage periods. VoiceVibes does not have information on the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider.\nThe plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses these for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its Website. Such an evaluation takes place in particular (also for non-logged-in users) for the representation of suitable advertisements and in order to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our Website. You have a right of objection to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right. Through the plug-ins, VoiceVibes offers you the ability to interact with social networks and other users, so that VoiceVibes can improve our service and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.\nThe data is passed on regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your data collected with us will be directly assigned to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you click the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. VoiceVibes recommends that you log out regularly after using a social network, especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.\nFurther information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider can be found in the privacy policy of these providers listed below. They will also provide you with further information about your rights in this regard and how to set options to protect your privacy.\nAddresses of the respective plug-in providers and URLs with their data protection information:\na) LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA;http://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.

These are all integrated in the \u201cextended data protection mode\u201d, i.e. no data about you as a user will be transmitted to YouTube if you do not play the videos. Only when you play the videos will the data referred to in paragraph 2 be transmitted. VoiceVibes has no influence on this data transmission.\nBy visiting the Website, YouTube receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding subpage of our Website. In addition, the data mentioned in the section \u201cCollection of personal data when you visit our Website\u201d of this Privacy Policy will be transmitted. This does not depend on whether YouTube provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged into Google, your information will be directly associated with your account. If you do not wish to be associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as user profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such evaluation takes place in particular (even for non-logged-in users) to provide demand- oriented advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our Website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, but you must contact YouTube to exercise this right.\nFurther information on the purpose and scope of data collection and processing by YouTube can be found in YouTube\u2019s privacy policy. There you will also find further information about your rights and how to set options to protect your privacy. Google also processes your personal data in the USA and has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.\n\nChoice.\nYou can contact us any time to opt-out of (a) promotional communications, or (b) any new processing of your personal information that we may carry out beyond the original purpose, or (c) the transfer of your personal information outside the United Kingdom, Switzerland or any country of the European Union (opting out of this subsection (c) will cause VoiceVibes\u2019 services to be ineffective upon opt-out).\nTransfers to Agents.\nVoiceVibes will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal information consistently with GDPR, including providing the same level of protection as is required under GDPR. Where VoiceVibes has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to GDPR, VoiceVibes will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.\nSecurity.\nVoiceVibes will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.\nEnforcement.\nVoiceVibes will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy. Any employee that VoiceVibes determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\nRetention of Personal Information.\nIf your VoiceVibes account becomes inactive because it was not timely renewed, and you have not opted in to permit us to retain your personal information, we will keep your personal information for a period of three months prior to beginning the process of deleting it. This will enable us to promptly reactivate your account in the event you renew during the initial three month period. Once the process of deleting your personal information has begun, it is possible that it may take up to an additional three months for all copies of your personal information to be removed from all of VoiceVibes\u2019 systems, backups, log files, and archives.\nObjection or revocation of the processing of your data\n\nIf you have given your consent to the processing of your data, you can revoke it at any time. Such revocation affects the lawfulness of processing your personal data after you have made it known to us.\nIf we base the processing of your personal data on the weighing of interests, you may object to the processing. This is the case in particular if processing is not necessary to fulfil a contract with you, which we explain in the following description of the functions. When you do object, we would ask you to explain the reasons why we should not process your personal data. In the event of a justified objection, we will examine the situation and either stop or adjust data processing, or point out to you our compelling reasons worthy of protection, on the basis of which we will continue processing.\nOf course, you can object to the processing of your personal data for the purposes of advertising and data analysis at any time. You can inform us about your contradiction using the following contact data:\n\nVoiceVibes, Inc.\n7224 Shub Farm Rd.\nMarriottsville, MD 21104\nUSA\nemail: privacyofficer@myvoicevibes.com\nContact/Dispute Resolution\nAny questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of, or any of your rights regarding, your personal information should be directed to the VoiceVibes Privacy Officer at privacyofficer@myvoicevibes.com.
