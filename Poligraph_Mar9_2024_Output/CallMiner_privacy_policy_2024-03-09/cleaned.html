We may change this Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Policy on our Site. If we make any changes to this Policy that materially affect our practices with regard to the personal information we have previously collected from you, we will endeavor to provide you with notice in advance of such change, for example, where feasible by highlighting the change on our Site.</p><p><span class="bold">Section 1</span> - <span class="bold">The Information That We Collect About You.</span></p><p><span class="bold">Information We Collect Directly From You.</span> We collect information directly from you when you use our Site or Services. The type of information that we collect from you depends on your particular interaction with our Site and our Services and may include the following: real name, business contact information, such as your company email address, postal address, and phone number, and any other information that you choose to provide to us. When you log in to our Services, we will collect your account name and password information. If you choose not to provide us with your information, we will not be able to provide you with our Services or respond to your inquiries.</p><p><span class="bold">Information We Collect Automatically About You</span>. We automatically collect information about your internet or other electronic network activity information while you make use of our Site or Services, through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, such as your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; the length of time you visit our Site and or use our Services; and the referring URL or webpage that led you to our Site.</p><p><span class="bold">Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</span></p><p><span class="bold">Do-Not-Track.</span> Our systems recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. We also do not track you after you leave our Site. You may disable certain tracking on our Site, as discussed in this section.</p><p><span class="bold">Cookies.</span> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s local storage via your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate on our Site and our Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities on our Site and Services.</p><p><span class="bold">Disabling Cookies.</span> Many web browsers automatically accept cookies or have a pop-up to allow you to manage cookies. If you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block cookies in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your device from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.</p><p><span class="bold">Clear GIFs, pixel tags and related technologies.</span> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are similar to cookies functionally. However, in contrast to cookies, which are stored on your device’s local storage, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We or our service providers may use clear GIFs, such as web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags, in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We or our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our prospects, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p><p><span class="bold">Other Party’s Analytics.</span> We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics to evaluate usage of our Site. We also utilize certain devices and applications such as Pendo’s Insights to evaluate our customers’ usage of our Services. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Site and Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Site’s and Services’ performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ and Pendo’s privacy policy at https://www.pendo.io/legal/privacy-policy/. You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p><p><span class="bold">Targeted Advertising and Ad Networks.</span> We or our service providers may send users targeted ads based on your location and activities within our Site and your use of our Services. We may also participate in other ad networks and allow such networks to use cookies, pixel tags, and other tracking technologies on our Site to collect usage information, to display targeted ads to you on our Site and on other sites, and to track the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These networks may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. You may opt-out of many ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of other party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: https://thenai.org/opt-out/ and www.aboutads.info/choices.</p><p>We may disclose certain information, such as your email address, to other parties—such as Google so that we can better target ads and content to you and others with similar interests on other parties’ websites or media (“Custom Audiences”). If you would like to opt-out of Google Analytics Audiences and other Google advertising, please visit https://adssettings.google.com.— We may also work with ad networks and marketing platforms that enable us and other participants to target ads to Custom Audiences submitted by us and others.
