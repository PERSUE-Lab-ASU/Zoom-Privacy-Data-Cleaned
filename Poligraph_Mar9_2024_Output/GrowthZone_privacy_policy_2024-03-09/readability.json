Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.</span></p><p><span>8.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:</span></p><p><span>(a) the right to access;</span></p><p><span>(b) the right to rectification;</span></p><p><span>(c) the right to erasure;</span></p><p><span>(d) the right to restrict processing;</span></p><p><span>(e) the right to object to processing;</span></p><p><span>(f) the right to data portability;</span></p><p><span>(g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and</span></p><p><span>(h) the right to withdraw consent.</span></p><p><span>8.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data.

Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data.

However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</span></p><p><span>8.10 If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws and requests to GrowthZone have not led to resolution, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.
