<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transfers of Personal Data</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Site is hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Electric and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Site, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Electric in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize Electric to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. You hereby consent to the transfer of your data to the U.S. pursuant to a data processing agreement incorporating standard data protection clauses promulgated by the European Commission, a copy of which can be obtained at </span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&amp;locale=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&amp;locale=en</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as may be amended or replaced from time to time by the European Commission.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Will Electric Ever Change This Privacy Policy?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re constantly trying to improve our Site, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric.ai/privacy-policy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by sending you an email</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Site, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Site after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</span></p>
<p><b>What If I Have Questions About This Policy?</b></p>
