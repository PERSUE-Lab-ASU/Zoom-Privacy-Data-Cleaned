<p><b>Version 2.1</b><b><br>
</b> <b>Last update: August 22, 2023</b><b></b></p><b>
</b><p><b></b></p>

<p>LEARN MORE:</p>

For example, we may contact you to inform you when your subscription is ending, to discuss your account, to let you know when updates are available, to remind you about features of the Services that are available for your use, to update you about a support request, or to invite you to participate in a survey.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How do we protect your information?</b></p>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. Your financial information (e.g. credit cards) is never stored on our servers.</p>
<p><b>How do we ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available?</b></p>
<p>SUMMARY:</p>
<p>We implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available.&nbsp; Specifically, we have implemented processes to help ensure high availability and business continuity.&nbsp; We commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access controls, and conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>LEARN MORE:</p>
<p><b>High Availability</b>.&nbsp; Every part of the Services utilize properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in case of failure.&nbsp; We take servers out of operation as part of regular maintenance, without impacting availability.</p>
<p><b>Business Continuity</b>.&nbsp; We keep encrypted backups of data on Heroku. While never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e., primary data stores loss), we will restore organizational data from these backups.</p>
<p><b>Physical Access Controls</b>.&nbsp; Donut is hosted on Heroku and AWS_. Those data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics.&nbsp; Donut employees do not have physical access to Heroku and AWS data centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.</p>
<p><b>Logical Access Controls</b>.&nbsp; Donut is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure on Heroku and AWS, and only designated authorized Donut operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p><b>Penetration Testing</b>.&nbsp; We engage an independent, third-party agency to perform penetration testing on a regular basis.&nbsp; Information about security vulnerabilities that are successfully exploited through penetration testing is then used to set mitigation and remediation priorities.&nbsp; If you are a customer on one of our “Enterprise” plans, we will provide a summary of penetration test findings to you upon request and signing our NDA.</p>
<p><b>Do we use cookies?</b></p>
<p>SUMMARY:</p>
<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.&nbsp; You can choose to disable cookies, but if you do, your ability to use or access certain parts of our website may be affected.</p>
<p>LEARN MORE:</p>
<p>We use cookies and other similar identifiers to understand and save your preferences for future visits, to advertise to you on other sites, and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. You can find information on popular browsers and how to adjust your cookie preferences at the following websites:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/psm/help_21/using_priv_help.html">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416">Google Chrome</a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265">Apple Safari</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you choose to disable cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies and/or you have not accepted our cookies policy, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.</p>
<p>Our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, and to count users who have visited those websites. We may also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters, to determine whether and when you open and act on them.</p>
<p>In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. This helps us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Donut website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser’s website.</p>
<p>Finally, our Services may contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers that help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites or other products.</p>
<p><b>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</b></p>
<p>SUMMARY:</p>
<p>We share your personal data with your consent, or as necessary to provide the Services to you. We also share your data with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our Services; and to protect our rights or our property.</p>
<p>LEARN MORE:</p>
<p>We share your personal data with your consent, or as necessary to provide the Services to you.&nbsp; We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. For example, companies we have hired to provide cloud hosting services, off-site backups, and customer support may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies are required to abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event.</p>
<p>Finally, we will access, transfer, disclose, and/or preserve personal data, when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, judicial orders, or subpoenas;</li>
<li aria-level="1">respond to requests from public or governmental authorities, including for national security or law enforcement purposes;</li>
<li aria-level="1">protect the vital interests of our users, customers, or other third parties (including, for example, to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone);</li>
<li aria-level="1">operate and maintain the security of our Services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks;</li>
<li aria-level="1">protect the rights, interests or property of Donut or third parties;</li>
<li aria-level="1">prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services; or</li>
<li aria-level="1">enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
</ol>
<p>We may use and share aggregated non-personal information with third parties for marketing, advertising, and analytics purposes.</p>
<p>We do not sell or trade your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p><b>How to Access and Control Your Personal Data</b></p>
<p>SUMMARY:</p>
<p>You can view, access, edit, or delete of your personal data for many aspects of the Services. How you can access and control your personal data will depend on which Services you use.</p>
<p>You can opt out from receiving marketing communications from us by using the opt-out link on the communication</p>
<p>LEARN MORE:</p>

<p><b>Where we Store and Process Personal Data; International Transfers</b></p>

<p><b>Data Retention</b></p>
<p>SUMMARY:</p>
<p>We may retain your personal information as long as you continue to use the Services, have an account with us, have Donut installed on your collaboration service or other Third Party Account, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in the policy. You can ask to close your account by contacting us at the details above, and we will delete your personal information on request.</p>
<p>We may, however, retain personal information for an additional period as is permitted or required under applicable laws, for legal, tax, or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.</p>
<p>LEARN MORE:</p>
<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Services to you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different types of data in the context of the different Services we provide, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria we use to determine the retention periods include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><i>How long is the personal data needed to provide the Services and/or operate our business?</i> This includes such things such as maintaining and improving the performance of the Services, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.</li>
<li aria-level="2"><i>Is Donut subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data?</i> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.</li>
<li aria-level="2"><i>Is Donut installed on your collaboration service?</i> Removing Donut from your collaboration service or other Third Party Account is a prerequisite for complete data deletion.</li>
</ul>
