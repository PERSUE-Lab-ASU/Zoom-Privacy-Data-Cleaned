For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.
                  </p><p>For the Service, we ask you to register an account, log in and provide certain information (such as names and email addresses of your team members, your company name and address and your credit card information) in order to be able to store your task data as well as periodically automatically bill you &amp; charge your card (credit card numbers are never stored on TCAI servers, but are securely transmitted and stored with our payment provider).
                  </p><p>We use cookies to store session information for your convenience. Cookies must be enabled to use the Website and the Service. We also store additional information which may contain personal information (like your time zone) in your local browser cache to ensure peak performance of the Service.

                  <p>In order to take advantage of certain features of the Service, you may also choose to provide us with other personal information, such as your picture, but your decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.
                  </p><h2>Use of the Data</h2>
                  <p>We only use your personal information to provide you with the Service to communicate with you about the Service or the Website. This includes both automated and manual processing of data.
                  </p><p>With respect to any data you may choose to enter or upload to the Service, we take the privacy and confidentiality of this data seriously. Your data (in the Service) is specifically not shared between accounts (unless you specifically choose to) or with the public. We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data that we store, including personal information. All off-site backups of your data are securely encrypted.
                  </p><p>Please note that if you choose to share data (like sharing a board with a client), we are not responsible for any violation of privacy law you may be liable for.
                  </p><p>We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:
                  doing so is appropriate to carry out a user’s request (for example, sharing a board with a client implies that you consent to share the data in this board with that client);
                  </p><p>we believe it’s necessary in order to provide the highest quality of service;
                  </p><p>we believe it’s needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;
                  </p><p>we believe it’s needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
                  otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.
                  </p><p>The Service is operated from the United States. If you are visiting the Website from outside the U.S., you agree to any processing of any personal information you provide us according to this policy.
                  </p><p>The Service may contact you by email. For example, we may send you promotional emails relating to the Service or communicate with you about your use of the Website and Service. If you do not want to receive email from us, please opt out of receiving emails at the bottom of any such email. Please note that for some emails (for example billing issues), there’s no option to opt-out.

                  </p><p>For client-side analytics and tracking beacons, you’re welcome to use content blocking software; just be aware that this may influence our ability to identify errors and performance problems in your account. We can’t guarantee that the Service will work as intended when browser extensions alter the HTML, CSS or JavaScript code we transmit (however, we don’t take any active steps to prevent you from using extensions, including content blockers).

                              <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following data protection rights:
                  You can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. You can exercise these rights by emailing support@teamcalendar.ai.
                  You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing support@teamcalendar.ai.
                  Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
                  You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
                              </p><p>If you want to request an export or deletion of your personal data, and have an account with us, please contact us at support@teamcalendar.ai. Please note that we cannot delete personal data in open accounts when you’re not the account owner, as this would prevent us from providing the service the account owner is paying for (We suggest that you contact the account owner of the Team Calendar AI account in question to ask them to anonymize or remove your data).
                  We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
                              </p><h2>International data transfers</h2>
                              <p>GDPR includes provisions on international data transfer mechanisms. In order to comply with these provisions, we have certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks.
                              </p><h2>Application Data and Backups</h2>
                              <p>In order to accommodate customers who need older data restored, we keep backups indefinitely and cannot delete personal data from them. These backups are read-only, heavily encrypted/compressed, and stored off-site. If we do have access or restore data to our production systems or for purposes of debugging, any deletions of personal data will be applied retroactively or the personal data will be anonymized.
                              </p><h2>Log files</h2>
                              <p>We store server log files for (up to) one year for the purposes of debugging errors and helping customers find out when specific data changes happened and who did them; and for preventing fraud and providing the necessary information when fraud is suspected.
                  We keep copies of all purchasing records for tax and auditing purposes.
                              </p><h2>Personal Metadata</h2>
                              <p>We keep personal metadata, given that the user allows us to process their data, which can be controlled by going to the Privacy tab in Settings &amp; Profile.
                                When a user chooses to opt out of a specific type of data processing, we cease sending any additional data to the relevant data controller(s). Every quarter, we contact our data processors with a list of users who have opted out of allowing us to process their personal data in the specific manner that we use their tools.
                                We will respond to Data Subject Rights Requests within the appropriate amount of time.
                  Some 3rd party services collect data independently from us, and have incorporated it as part of their service.
                  Requests for data collected and controlled by third-party services should be directed to them, as we do not maintain copies of this data nor have control over it.
                              </p><h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
                              <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make any significant changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Website or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.
                  Changes to this Privacy Policy may go into effect immediately to ensure that we can provide the Service without interruptions (for example, we may have to switch 3rd-party providers of application features on short notice if they experience technical difficulties or go out of business).
                              </p><h2>Questions and contact information</h2>

                  &lt;p&gt;By using teamcalendar.ai (the “Website”) and/or a Team Calendar account (the “Service”), you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.
                      The Service is designed and operated by Team Calendar AI (“TCAI”).
                      Please read the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy in their entirety, and refer to those documents for definitions and contacts.
                  &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;h2&gt;Data Collected&lt;/h2&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We're not in the business of selling, renting out or trading your data with 3rd parties. All data collected is used to provide you with the Service only, and all your private data and intellectual property is always yours.
              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="col-lg-6"&gt;&lt;img src="assets/privacy.jpeg" alt="..." class="hero-image img-fluid d-none d-lg-block" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website and Service to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Service, we ask you to register an account, log in and provide certain information (such as names and email addresses of your team members, your company name and address and your credit card information) in order to be able to store your task data as well as periodically automatically bill you &amp;amp; charge your card (credit card numbers are never stored on TCAI servers, but are securely transmitted and stored with our payment provider).
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use cookies to store session information for your convenience. Cookies must be enabled to use the Website and the Service. We also store additional information which may contain personal information (like your time zone) in your local browser cache to ensure peak performance of the Service.
                  &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In order to take advantage of certain features of the Service, you may also choose to provide us with other personal information, such as your picture, but your decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use of the Data&lt;/h2&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We only use your personal information to provide you with the Service to communicate with you about the Service or the Website. This includes both automated and manual processing of data.
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to any data you may choose to enter or upload to the Service, we take the privacy and confidentiality of this data seriously. Your data (in the Service) is specifically not shared between accounts (unless you specifically choose to) or with the public. We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data that we store, including personal information. All off-site backups of your data are securely encrypted.
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that if you choose to share data (like sharing a board with a client), we are not responsible for any violation of privacy law you may be liable for.
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:
                  doing so is appropriate to carry out a user’s request (for example, sharing a board with a client implies that you consent to share the data in this board with that client);
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we believe it’s necessary in order to provide the highest quality of service;
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we believe it’s needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we believe it’s needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
                  otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Service is operated from the United States. If you are visiting the Website from outside the U.S., you agree to any processing of any personal information you provide us according to this policy.
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Service may contact you by email. For example, we may send you promotional emails relating to the Service or communicate with you about your use of the Website and Service. If you do not want to receive email from us, please opt out of receiving emails at the bottom of any such email. Please note that for some emails (for example billing issues), there’s no option to opt-out.
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sharing of Data&lt;/h2&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt; We don’t share your personal information with third parties except as listed below. Other then the information outlined below, only aggregated, statistical data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Website and Service.
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For client-side analytics and tracking beacons, you’re welcome to use content blocking software; just be aware that this may influence our ability to identify errors and performance problems in your account. We can’t guarantee that the Service will work as intended when browser extensions alter the HTML, CSS or JavaScript code we transmit (however, we don’t take any active steps to prevent you from using extensions, including content blockers).
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of the data that third parties we share data with extract. Feel free to check out their own Privacy Policies to find out more.
                  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tracking errors and measuring performance:&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;h3&gt;Google Analytics: no personally identifiable data is shared (privacy policy)&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Transactional emails (Reports, Billing-related emails, etc.):&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Postmark: your name and email and account data inside emails (privacy policy)&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;h3&gt;Provisioning of application features:&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Stripe: your email, plan details and credit card information, as we do not store your credit card data ourselves (privacy policy)
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service hosting and data backups&lt;/h3&gt;
                 &lt;p&gt;Amazon AWS: storing encrypted archives of backup data [this data is not readable by Amazon AWS] (privacy policy)
                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon S3: storing user avatars and file uploads (privacy policy)
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, TCAI uses third party vendors that provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage and other technology required to run the Website and the Service. While TCAI owns the rights to the Website and Service, you retain all rights to the data you enter into the Service.
                  In order to provide the Service, we also share data with services that help us track errors and bugs, keep backups of log files and identify performance issues (these are listed above).
                  We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share personal information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.
                  If TCAI is acquired or merged with another company, or TCAI sells the Website and Service to another company, or if TCAI goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information may be transferred to a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of TCAI or its assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;GDPR compliance and Privacy Shield&lt;/h2&gt;
                              &lt;p&gt;For a detailed list of data sub-processors under the GDPR please see above under "Sharing of Data".
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your Data Protection Rights Under The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/h2&gt;
                              &lt;p&gt;If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following data protection rights:
                  You can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. You can exercise these rights by emailing support@teamcalendar.ai.
                  You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing support@teamcalendar.ai.
                  Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
                  You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to request an export or deletion of your personal data, and have an account with us, please contact us at support@teamcalendar.ai. Please note that we cannot delete personal data in open accounts when you’re not the account owner, as this would prevent us from providing the service the account owner is paying for (We suggest that you contact the account owner of the Team Calendar AI account in question to ask them to anonymize or remove your data).
                  We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;International data transfers&lt;/h2&gt;
                              &lt;p&gt;GDPR includes provisions on international data transfer mechanisms. In order to comply with these provisions, we have certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks.
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Application Data and Backups&lt;/h2&gt;
                              &lt;p&gt;In order to accommodate customers who need older data restored, we keep backups indefinitely and cannot delete personal data from them. These backups are read-only, heavily encrypted/compressed, and stored off-site. If we do have access or restore data to our production systems or for purposes of debugging, any deletions of personal data will be applied retroactively or the personal data will be anonymized.
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Log files&lt;/h2&gt;
                              &lt;p&gt;We store server log files for (up to) one year for the purposes of debugging errors and helping customers find out when specific data changes happened and who did them; and for preventing fraud and providing the necessary information when fraud is suspected.
                  We keep copies of all purchasing records for tax and auditing purposes.
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Personal Metadata&lt;/h2&gt;
                              &lt;p&gt;We keep personal metadata, given that the user allows us to process their data, which can be controlled by going to the Privacy tab in Settings &amp;amp; Profile.
                                When a user chooses to opt out of a specific type of data processing, we cease sending any additional data to the relevant data controller(s). Every quarter, we contact our data processors with a list of users who have opted out of allowing us to process their personal data in the specific manner that we use their tools.
                                We will respond to Data Subject Rights Requests within the appropriate amount of time.
                  Some 3rd party services collect data independently from us, and have incorporated it as part of their service.
                  Requests for data collected and controlled by third-party services should be directed to them, as we do not maintain copies of this data nor have control over it.
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Changes to the Privacy Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
                              &lt;p&gt;We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make any significant changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Website or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.
                  Changes to this Privacy Policy may go into effect immediately to ensure that we can provide the Service without interruptions (for example, we may have to switch 3rd-party providers of application features on short notice if they experience technical difficulties or go out of business).
                              &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Questions and contact information&lt;/h2&gt;
                              &lt;p&gt;Should you have any questions or concerns, please write to support@teamcalendar.ai, or write to:&lt;/p&gt;
