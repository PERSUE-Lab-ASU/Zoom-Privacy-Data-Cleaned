To this end we fully endorse and adhere to data protection law across Europe in the form of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the equivalent data protection law in the UK. As your Data Controller, Casting Workbook has notified its activities to the Office of the Information Commissioner as required under the Data Protection Act 1998 and can be found in the Data Protection Public Register.</p>\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Relationships when Casting Workbook is not your Data Controller</h3>\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you are a Casting Workbook member, please note that your agent (if you are represented) or training establishment may also act as your Data Controller both for the supply of your information to Casting Workbook and its use in submissions made by your Agent on your behalf via Casting Workbook link, and additionally for any third party tools your Agent or training establishment may employ to administer your data. It is your responsibility to ensure that your Agent or training establishment only processes your personal data in accordance with your wishes.</p>\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>\t\t\t\t\t<p>Casting Workbook keeps this Privacy Policy under regular review and may change this policy occasionally by updating this page. Where practical we will notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy and prompt you to review these. However, you should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. Your continued access and use of this site or other Casting Workbook services will mean that you agree to our then-current Privacy Policy.</p>\t\t\t\t\t<h3>How do we make sure your data is used lawfully?</h3>\t\t\t\t\t<p>We will only collect, use, store, share (and any other of the defined uses of processing data) where there is a lawful basis as defined by data protection legislation, and do not collect more information than we need to fulfill the purpose. We document what lawful bases are relied upon for our processing activities. Lawful bases include where you have given <strong>consent</strong>, where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, when <strong>complying with law</strong> and where there are <strong>legitimate interests</strong>. More information on how we use these lawful bases is provided below:</p>\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Consent</strong> - In certain situations we can process your data with your consent. Where we process data based on consent, we will ask you for your explicit consent (you have to take an action) which you can withdraw at any time, but it will not affect the lawfulness of processing before then. For children under 16, consent will be gained from the parent or guardian. For example, if you tick a box to receive email marketing communication from us.</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Contract</strong> - In certain situations, we need your personal information to comply with our contractual obligations. Where we rely on contract, we will ask you to agree to the use of your personal data necessary for entering into or the performance of your contract with us. For example, by becoming a Casting Workbook member we will collect information about you so we can deliver the service to you.</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Complying with law</strong> - we may need to process your personal information if the law requires us to. For example, we may have to pass on information of people in fraud or other criminal activity to law enforcement.</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong> - We will only rely on legitimate interests where the processing of your data is not overridden by your interests or rights and freedoms. This means that we may need your information and use in a way that can reasonably be expected as part of us running Casting Workbook and does not materially impact your rights, freedoms or interests. For example, we may use your information to build a more accurate picture of you to better inform our business decisions.</li>\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\t\t\t\t\t<br>\t\t\t\t\t<h3>When do we collect your personal information?</h3>\t\t\t\t\t<p>We will collect personal information from you when your:</p>\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Visit and/or use our Site and/or Services;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Sign up to or use Site and/or Services;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Become a registered member with us;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Purchase a product or service from us, such as a room booking or editing sessions;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Book to attend an event;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Complete a survey or feedback form;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Provide feedback or review our Site and/or Services;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Correspond with us on social media;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Contact us with a form of query, compliment or complaint (plus other types of enquiries) via phone, email or post;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Enter a competition or prize draw;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Use other features of the Site and/or Services.</li>\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\t\t\t\t\t<br>\t\t\t\t\t<h3>What personal information do we collect?</h3>\t\t\t\t\t<p>We will only ever ask you for the necessary information needed to process your data.

Casting Workbook is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of Third Party Sites.</p>\t\t\t\t\t<h3>What personal information do we share?</h3>\t\t\t\t\t<p>We sometimes share personal information with carefully selected and trusted third parties. Wherever possible only information contained within your public profile would be released to such third parties. To keep your data safe and maintain your privacy we have the following approach:</p>\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>We implement appropriate legal, procedural and technical controls;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>We only provide the information they need to undertake that service;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>They can only use the information for that specific purpose;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>We maintain a close relationship to make sure that your data is protected and your privacy maintained;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>We mandate that if or when the service stops, they must return or delete any information held.</li>\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Here are the examples of the types of trusted third parties we work with:</p>\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Casting Workbook network partners, circulating breakdown information via their casting platforms in other territories;</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Subcontractors assisting us in providing our service to our users,</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>IT companies who help us deliver our sites and services;</li>\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\t\t\t\t\t<br>\t\t\t\t\t<h3>How long do we keep your information?</h3>\t\t\t\t\t<p>We will not keep personal information for longer than it is necessary, and will only retain information for as long as needed to carry out our functions and that purpose.

For example, if we contract with service providers based outside the EEA, or if any of our servers are at any time based outside the EEA (including 'cloud' service provision). If it is, then we put in place controls to make sure that your information has the same level of protection as if it was inside the EEA. Where we would have to disclose your personal information to third parties, in any circumstances, we will always take all appropriate steps to ensure that such third parties are responsible and trusted and that your personal information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and to European and UK Data Protection standards or equivalent.</p>\t\t\t\t\t<h3>How to deal with Data Breaches</h3>\t\t\t\t\t<p>We have robust measures in place to minimize and prevent data breaches from taking place. Should a breach of personal data occur (whether in respect of you or someone else) then we must take notes and keep evidence of that breach.

To do so, you should contact our Data Protection Officer. </li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>You have the right to object to data processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest to do so and you think that your rights and interests outweigh our own and you wish us to stop. </li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>You have the right to object if we process your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing. </li>\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>You have the right to receive a copy of your personal data and to transfer your personal data to another data controller.

Payment card details are not stored on our servers beyond this.</p>\t\t\t\t\t<p>Our secure socket layer software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions.

Where we process data based on consent, we will ask you for your explicit consent (you have to take an action) which you can withdraw at any time, but it will not affect the lawfulness of processing before then. For children under 16, consent will be gained from the parent or guardian. For example, if you tick a box to receive email marketing communication from us.\t\t\t\t\t\tContract - In certain situations, we need your personal information to comply with our contractual obligations. Where we rely on contract, we will ask you to agree to the use of your personal data necessary for entering into or the performance of your contract with us. For example, by becoming a Casting Workbook member we will collect information about you so we can deliver the service to you.\t\t\t\t\t\tComplying with law - we may need to process your personal information if the law requires us to. For example, we may have to pass on information of people in fraud or other criminal activity to law enforcement.\t\t\t\t\t\tLegitimate interest - We will only rely on legitimate interests where the processing of your data is not overridden by your interests or rights and freedoms. This means that we may need your information and use in a way that can reasonably be expected as part of us running Casting Workbook and does not materially impact your rights, freedoms or interests. For example, we may use your information to build a more accurate picture of you to better inform our business decisions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen do we collect your personal information?\t\t\t\t\tWe will collect personal information from you when your:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVisit and/or use our Site and/or Services;\t\t\t\t\t\tSign up to or use Site and/or Services;\t\t\t\t\t\tBecome a registered member with us;\t\t\t\t\t\tPurchase a product or service from us, such as a room booking or editing sessions;\t\t\t\t\t\tBook to attend an event;\t\t\t\t\t\tComplete a survey or feedback form;\t\t\t\t\t\tProvide feedback or review our Site and/or Services;\t\t\t\t\t\tCorrespond with us on social media;\t\t\t\t\t\tContact us with a form of query, compliment or complaint (plus other types of enquiries) via phone, email or post;\t\t\t\t\t\tEnter a competition or prize draw;\t\t\t\t\t\tUse other features of the Site and/or Services.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat personal information do we collect?\t\t\t\t\tWe will only ever ask you for the necessary information needed to process your data.

Casting Workbook is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of Third Party Sites.\t\t\t\t\tWhat personal information do we share?\t\t\t\t\tWe sometimes share personal information with carefully selected and trusted third parties. Wherever possible only information contained within your public profile would be released to such third parties. To keep your data safe and maintain your privacy we have the following approach:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe implement appropriate legal, procedural and technical controls;\t\t\t\t\t\tWe only provide the information they need to undertake that service;\t\t\t\t\t\tThey can only use the information for that specific purpose;\t\t\t\t\t\tWe maintain a close relationship to make sure that your data is protected and your privacy maintained;\t\t\t\t\t\tWe mandate that if or when the service stops, they must return or delete any information held.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHere are the examples of the types of trusted third parties we work with:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCasting Workbook network partners, circulating breakdown information via their casting platforms in other territories;\t\t\t\t\t\tSubcontractors assisting us in providing our service to our users,\t\t\t\t\t\tIT companies who help us deliver our sites and services;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow long do we keep your information?\t\t\t\t\tWe will not keep personal information for longer than it is necessary, and will only retain information for as long as needed to carry out our functions and that purpose. Personal information is retained in line with our retention schedule.\t\t\t\t\tWhere your information is processed\t\t\t\t\tThe information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ('EEA') in certain circumstances. For example, if we contract with service providers based outside the EEA, or if any of our servers are at any time based outside the EEA (including 'cloud' service provision). If it is, then we put in place controls to make sure that your information has the same level of protection as if it was inside the EEA. Where we would have to disclose your personal information to third parties, in any circumstances, we will always take all appropriate steps to ensure that such third parties are responsible and trusted and that your personal information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and to European and UK Data Protection standards or equivalent.\t\t\t\t\tHow to deal with Data Breaches\t\t\t\t\tWe have robust measures in place to minimize and prevent data breaches from taking place. Should a breach of personal data occur (whether in respect of you or someone else) then we must take notes and keep evidence of that breach. If the breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals then we must also notify the Information Commissioner's Office within 72 hours. \t\t\t\t\tYour data subject rights\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou have the right to information about what personal data we process, how and on what basis as set out in this policy. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou have the right to access your own personal data by way of a subject access request. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou can correct any inaccuracies in your personal data. To do so, you should contact our Data Protection Officer. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou have the right to request that we erase your personal data where we were not entitled under the law to process it or it is no longer necessary to process it for the purpose it was collected. To do so, you should contact our Data Protection Officer. \t\t\t\t\t\tWhile you are requesting that your personal data is corrected or erased or are contesting the lawfulness of our processing, you can apply for its use to be restricted while the application is made. To do so, you should contact our Data Protection Officer. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou have the right to object to data processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest to do so and you think that your rights and interests outweigh our own and you wish us to stop. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou have the right to object if we process your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou have the right to receive a copy of your personal data and to transfer your personal data to another data controller. We will not charge for this and will, in most cases, aim to do this within one month. \t\t\t\t\t\tWith some exceptions, you have the right not to be subjected to automated decision-making. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou have the right to be notified of a data security breach concerning your personal data. \t\t\t\t\t\tIn most situations we will not rely on your consent as a lawful ground to process your data. If we do however request your consent to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose, you have the right not to consent or to withdraw your consent later. To withdraw your consent, you should contact our Data Protection Officer. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPayment Security\t\t\t\t\tWe will retain payment details briefly (the duration of time it takes to complete each transaction) whilst purchases are made through our online shop. Payment card details are not stored on our servers beyond this.\t\t\t\t\tOur secure socket layer software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all personal information including credit card numbers, names and addresses. This encryption has the objective of ensuring that nothing can be read as it travels over the Internet to our chosen fully PCI DSS compliant payment service providers for processing.\t\t\t\t\tIf you experience any payment problems when placing an order via our Site, we advise you to resubmit your payment details. If your payment still fails, please contact your card issuer, to ensure there are no problems with your account, before contacting our customer services team.\t\t\t\t\tKeeping your personal information up-to-date\t\t\t\t\tCasting Workbook provides you with access to your personal information and tools to manage this.

We will take any complaints we receive about your privacy very seriously.\t\t\t\t\tYou also have the right to complain to your supervisory authority if you are unhappy with how your personal information has been collected, used or managed.\t\t\t\t\tYour information rights\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccess your information - you can request access to or a copy of your personal information and check what information we hold about you.\t\t\t\t\t\tChange or correct your information - if you wish to have any errors corrected, you can request this - although this is not an absolute right and we may request for further information.\t\t\t\t\t\tTake your information - you can ask for a copy of your personal information to be provided in a reusable and machine-readable form.\t\t\t\t\t\tObject to, limit or restrict the use of your information - you can ask that we stop using parts or all of your personal information or limit its use if you believe that this personal information is unlawfully held.\t\t\t\t\t\tDirect marketing - you can ask that we stop using your personal information for direct marketing.
