How We Use Personal Data</span></h2>\n<h3>a. To Communicate with You About the Product and Services</h3>\n<p>We use the account information you provide to HubSpot when signing up for the Subscription Service and Trends services to send you transactional emails or in-app notification about billing, account management, and other administrative matters. We may also send you updates regarding our Customer Terms of Service or other legal agreements, and may also communicate with you about security incidents via email or in-app notification.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We use your information to provide customer support, such as resolving technical issues you encounter and analyzing product outages or bugs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you use the HubSpot mobile applications, we may send you push notifications from time to time in order to update you about events and promotions. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level.</p>\n<h3>b. To Provide the Subscription Service</h3>\n<p>We use your account information and Customer Data to provide the product and services to you. For example, we use the email address you provide when signing up for the product to create your user account, and we use your payment information to process payments for paid use of the Subscription Service. We also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer support.</p>\n<h3>c. To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services</h3>\n<p>We collect usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services. We use this data to develop and improve our products and services.&nbsp; For example, we use usage data to assess trends and usage across the product to help us determine what new features or integrations our users may be interested in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We use Customer Data for machine learning that supports certain products and development of features and functionality with the Subscription Service and similar products and services. For example, machine learning helps power the business card scanner tool if you use our mobile apps and allows for easier imports of data into your HubSpot account. You may opt-out of having your Customer Data used for machine learning by emailing <a href=\"mailto:privacy@hubspot.com\" rel=\"noopener\">privacy@hubspot.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may publish data about how our product and services are being used across our customer base.

For example, we may publish blog posts on trends or insights into how users are interacting with our product.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>d. To Secure and Protect our Product and HubSpot Users</h3>\n<p>We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents. We may also use this information to meet legal requirements. We use your information to verify user accounts, new product sign-ups, and to detect and prevent product abuse. This includes enforcing our <a href=\"file:///acceptable-use\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience.

To Market and Promote the Subscription Service</h3>\n<p>We use the information you provide to HubSpot to market and promote the products, services, and other offerings.

However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.</p>\n<p>If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>\n\n\n<h2>3<span>. How We Share Personal Data</span></h2>\n<h3>a. Service Providers&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>We may share Personal Data with our third party service providers to support our websites, products, and services. For example, we use service providers for data hosting, application development, marketing, sales support and customer support. We may need to share your information with service providers to provide information about products or services to you. Examples may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data or performing statistical analysis on your use of the Subscription Service or interactions on our websites, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, developing and improving the product and services, and providing customer service or support. These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the third party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies and standards.</p>\n<h3>b. Partners&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>We may share data with trusted HubSpot partners to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis, provide sales support, or provide customer support. Partners are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your data.</p>\n<p>We also partner with trusted third parties to provide you with co-marketing content that we think may be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners, we will tell you who we are sharing data with, and provide a link to the co-marketing partner\u2019s privacy policy so you can learn more about how to opt-out of the partner\u2019s communications. These co-marketing partners are required to adhere to our privacy and data protection policies. For more information on our co-marketing program, see <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/co-marketing-request-form?__hstc=753710.e17dd1637e2257d9fbd9bed89f6d600c.1740584640810.1740584640810.1740584640810.1&amp;__hssc=753710.1.1740584640810&amp;__hsfp=3618309378\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a>.</p>\n<h3>c. Corporate Events&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by HubSpot on the websites and the Subscription Service. In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.</p>\n<h3>d. Public Forums</h3>\n<p>Our websites may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums (e.g. HubSpot Community and Connect.com). Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public message boards, blogs, or forums (including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information) it may be read, collected and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you may disclose in this way. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the websites if you so request, as described in Section 7 \"Your Privacy Rights and Choices\" below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.</p>\n<h3>e. Compelled Disclosure&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process. If you use the Subscription Service, Customer Data is considered Confidential Information and you should review the Confidentiality terms in the Customer Terms of Service for more information.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.\nIf we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).
