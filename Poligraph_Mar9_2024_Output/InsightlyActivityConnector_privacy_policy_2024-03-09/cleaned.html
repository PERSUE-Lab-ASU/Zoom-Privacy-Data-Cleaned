<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Insightly, Inc. respects your privacy and feels it is important for you to know how we collect and process the information we receive from you via our website at <a href="https://www.insightly.com">www.insightly.com</a><span> </span>(the “Site”) and through our on-demand business productivity software, our support platform, mobile applications and tools and services offered on the Site and mobile application (together the “Services”). This Privacy Policy explains our information practices, the kinds of information we may collect, how we use and share that information, and how you can opt-out of a use or correct or change that information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into Insightly’s <a href="/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a> (the “Terms”). All other terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meanings set forth in the Terms.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “Personal Information” shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, including, but not limited to, such person’s first and last name, or email address. This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that Insightly collects and processes in the course of our business, including on the Site and the Insightly platform, but excludes all users’ email data. This Privacy Policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access, update and request deletion of this information. The use of information collected through the Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which Insightly’s client has engaged us. This Privacy Policy is intended to meet requirements globally, including those in North America, Europe, APAC, and other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Insightly complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.
