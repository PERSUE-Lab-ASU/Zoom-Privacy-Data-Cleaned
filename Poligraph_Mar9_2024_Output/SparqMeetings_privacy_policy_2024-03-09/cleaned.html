<h1>Sparq Meetings Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>
    This Sparq Meetings Privacy Policy (“Policy”) covers how Sparq Data Solutions
    (“Supplier”) handles personal information collected and received from or
    through the Sparq Meetings website, including the online applications at
    https://meeting.sparqdata.com/ and http://www.sparqdata.com/, (together, the “Site”).
    As used in this Policy, the term “Supplier” shall also include its third-party
    business partners, resellers, and vendors that supply, operate, or otherwise make
    Sparq Meetings or the Site available to subscribers and users.
    This Policy applies to information Supplier collects in connection with use of the Site.
    It does not apply to information collected through other means or by others,
    such as through third-party social media sites or by the Sparq Meetings
    subscriber/account holder.
</p>
<p>
    Personal information is information about you that ordinarily would not be publicly
    available and that identifies you individually, such as your name, residential
    address, personal e-mail address, geolocation (your mobile internet device’s
    longitudinal and latitudinal information), and personal phone number.
</p>

<h2>Accessing the Site and Personal Information Collection</h2>
<p>
    You are not required to hold a Sparq Meetings subscription and you not required
    to provide personal information in order to access certain parts of the Site.
    When you access the Site without actively providing any personal information,
    we may collect limited technical information, such as your IP address and geolocation.
    We also use cookies and analytics as described below.
</p>
<p>
    Certain parts of the Site do require that you provide us with personal information
    in order to gain access to or use of those parts.
    You may also provide information if you participate in a chat session through the
    live chat feature offered by third-party providers in some areas of the Site.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
    Supplier uses cookies (text files placed on your hard drive by a web server) to
    help personalize and maximize your experience and time online.
    Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
    They are uniquely assigned to your computer and can only be read by a web server in
    the domain that issued the cookie to you.
    We use cookies to improve the Site and to facilitate your use of the Site.

</p>

<h2>How We Collect and Use Sparq Meetings User Information</h2>

            addresses or browsing activity.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p></p>
<p>
    Supplier collects this information:
    </p><ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            Automatically as you navigate through the Site.
            For example, the Site automatically captures the date and time when you
            access the Site, the IP address from which you access the Site, and your
            activity on the Site.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

        </li>
    </ul>

    no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

            The Site, and data collected from subscribers and users, is hosted on the
            Microsoft Corp. Azure platform.
            If you would like more information about the privacy and security of customer
            data stored on the Azure platform, go to:

    We encourage you to become aware of the privacy policies and statements on other sites.
</p>

<h2>Protection of Information</h2>
<p>
    Some areas of the Site are secured and can only be accessed using unique login credentials.
    You must have a specific user identifier (user ID) and password to access resources
    through any password-protected portions of the Site.
    Your login credentials and password are for your use only and are strictly confidential.
    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of those
    credentials and are responsible for all activity occurring on the Site using your
    login credentials and password.
    You are strictly prohibited from any sharing of your login credentials and/or
    password with any other person(s) and from any use of your login credentials other
    than for your use of the Site in compliance with this Policy.
</p>

<h2>Social Media</h2>
<p>
    The collection and use of information on social media websites and applications are
    governed by their own privacy policies.
    Please remember that any information posted on or through any Sparq Meetings social
    media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, or on other social
    media pages or channels, is subject to the policies and practices of the applicable
    social media channel.
</p>
<p>
    We may receive personal information from a social media site platform or application
    when you connect through a social media feed, post content, or otherwise interact with
    us using social media tools.
    For example, we may receive basic Facebook account information (name, e-mail, gender,
    birthday, current city, and profile picture URL) through Facebook.
    Also, when you “like” us, or send a “Tweet” to us through a social media channel,
    we may receive your username, handle, and any other available personal information
    from the social media site or application.
    All information received from social media sites and applications is treated and used
    in the same manner and for the same purposes as described in this Policy with respect
    to similar information we obtain through the Site.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Data Collection/Online Tracking</h2>
<p>
    We may use service providers such as Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and
    Google AdWords to help us understand and improve the usage of the Site and the
    effectiveness of our marketing.
    Google Analytics may use cookies, your IP address or an anonymous identifier as well
    as certain information from your browser, together with other information about you
    and your visits to our Site and other websites, so that we, Google, or third parties
    may provide you with advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on
    our Site and other websites (including through Google search results pages) and/or
    to provide analytical information about our Site.
    If you would like more information about advertising networks, including choices
    about the use of information by Google and other companies for multi-site advertising
    purposes, go to
    <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">
        www.networkadvertising.org
    </a> and
    <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/" target="_blank">optout.networkadvertising.org</a>.
    Also, Google offers a Google Analytics browser add-on (designed to be compatible only
    with certain browsers) to provide website visitors the ability to prevent their data
    from being collected and used by Google Analytics.
    That add-on may be obtained <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>;
    other Google privacy controls are available <a href="https://privacy.google.com/take-control.html" target="_blank">here</a>;
    and you can manage your Google ad settings <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Various internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that uses a DNT header
    to indicate the DNT preference setting on the browser.
    Supplier does not track your activity over time and across different websites or online
    services, and thus we do not currently respond to browsers’ DNT signals with respect
    to the Site.
    We do not permit our third-party service providers to collect information from the Site
    for other websites or for their own purposes other than as described in this Policy.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

    How long we retain your Personal Data depends on the type of data and the purpose for 
    which we process the data. 
    We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes 
    outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
</p>

<h2>Geolocation Information</h2>
<p>
    We may receive information about your geolocation and your mobile internet device when
    you use our Site.
    We may use this information to provide you with location-based services and information.
    Most mobile internet devices allow you to turn off geolocation, and we encourage you
    to contact your device manufacturer for detailed instructions on how to do so.
</p>

    through the Site, we will remove and permanently delete that information as soon as
    reasonably possible.

    We employ reasonable security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
    accuracy, and ensure correct use of your information.
