Encryption requires TLS 1.2, or higher, which is enabled by default on modern versions of Windows and supported by most major web browsers. The server facilitates the exchange of basic, polling-related, information, between the host PC and the participants. This information includes data such as:\n\t</p><ul>\n\t\t<li>Meeting IDs.</li>\n\t\t<li>The text for questions and choices.</li>\n\t\t<li>Numeric and text-based responses submitted by participants.</li>\n\t\t<li>Optional participant login criteria.</li>\n\t</ul><p>\n\tThe operator of the host PC may request names or pre-defined user IDs to uniquely associate participant responses with an individual within the host PC.
