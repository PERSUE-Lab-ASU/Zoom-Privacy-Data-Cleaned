Our primary goal is to provide you with exceptional service (see the <a href="https://www.calendar.com/terms/">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;for a definition), and we understand that you may have questions or concerns regarding your personal information and how it will be used.</p><p>To make this privacy policy easy to find, we make it available from home page of the Calendar website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calendar.com">https://www.calendar.com</a>&nbsp;(the “website”) and through our mobile applications. You may also email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@calendar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy@calendar.com</a>&nbsp;with any privacy-related questions you have.</p><h3></h3><h3 class="subtitle">Applicability of The Privacy Policy</h3><p>This privacy policy applies to all information we collect through our web and mobile applications from Calendar users, including you.</p><p>Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.</p><h3></h3><h3 class="subtitle">The Information We Collect</h3><p>When you visit the website or use one of our mobile applications, we collect your IP address, and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. We also may collect certain geo-location information. <span>We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources.&nbsp;</span>If you do not agree to our collection of this information, you may not be able to use our Service.</p><p>In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Platform. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date and time.</p><p>If you open an account, we collect the following information from you. You provide this information voluntarily by using our product:</p><h4>Account Information</h4><p>Calendar Members may give us permission to access their information in other services. For example, with your consent, you may link your Calendar account with your Google, Gmail, Microsoft Office 365 account, iCal, Yahoo, AOL or other similar service, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (like your basic profile or contacts). The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p><h4>Identification Information</h4><p>Your name, street address, email address, date of birth, and SSN (or other governmental issued verification numbers).</p><h4>Device Information</h4><p>We also may obtain information about you: (a) from your mobile device such as your device type, machine or mobile device identification number, geo-location, time zone, language setting, browser type, and IP address, and (b) from third parties for purposes of transaction processing, identity verification, fraud detection or prevention and other similar purposes. For fraud prevention purposes, we also may link your machine ID with the machines of others who use your same payment cards.</p><h4>Appointment Information</h4><p><span>When a Calendar User comes to Calendar to schedule an event with a Calendar Member, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, email address and phone number; email addresses of other people; subject of the meeting; and any other information you provide us or as required by the Calendar Member you are scheduling with. If you receive an invitation from a Calendar Member but do not wish to become a Calendar User, please contact the Calendar Member who sent the invitation through other means to set up your meeting.&nbsp;</span></p><h4>Connecting a Calendar</h4><p><span>A Calendar Member may also connect their calendar with Calendar. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when you’re busy. We never know who you’re meeting with, their email, the meeting title or any other details about the appointments in your calendar.</span></p><h4>Social Web Information</h4><p><span>Including but not limited to your Google connect credentials (and information that you authorize Google share with us though permissions) and email account information. If you authorize Google Connect, the plug in allows us access to your friends’ contact information. We also allow you to import data from other social web services, including but not limited to Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Google+, Linkedin, email lists and email service providers.</span></p><p>Social and e-mail contact information helps you connect to friends and contacts for invitation and payment transmission purposes (as well as helping us improve our services and fight fraud). Additionally, another Calendar user may mention you in a transaction in which you are not a party to by “tagging” your username in a transaction note. When you are mentioned in a transaction, a link to your Calendar profile will appear in the transaction note and you will receive a notification about the mentions. You may manage certain contact preferences and notifications in your account settings.</p><h4>Financial Information</h4><p>Bank account and routing numbers and credit cards linked to your Calendar account. If you purchase any premium or enterprise version of Calendar, our third-party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, card type and the expiration date.</p><p>We are committed to providing a safe, secure and all around great service. Therefore, before permitting you to use our Service, we may require additional information from you we can use to verify your identity, address or other information or to manage risk and compliance throughout our relationship. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification, fraud prevention and similar services.</p><p>When you are using the Calendar Service, we collect information about your account transactions and trust relationships and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention and other similar purposes.</p><p>Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.</p><h3></h3><h3 class="document-header">Information Collected Automatically</h3><p>Like many websites, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device subject to your opt-out preferences (see Your Rights and Choices section below). Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Services, improve your experience, and tailor marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</p><h4><span>Log &amp; Device data</span></h4><p>When you use Calendar, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website. This log data may include your web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone or location. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.</p><p>For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p><h3></h3><h3 class="document-header">Information Collected from Children</h3><p>Calendar is not directed or targeted to children under thirteen (13) years or age and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete such personal information from our systems.</p><h3></h3><h3 class="subtitle">How We Use Cookies</h3><p>When you access the website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called “cookies” on your computer.</p><p>For example, we send a “session cookie” to your computer any time you log in to your Calendar account. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don’t need to ask you for your password on each page.</p><p>You are free to decline Calendar cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of the website.</p><h4><span>Cookie data.</span></h4><p>Depending on how you’re accessing our products and subject to your opt-out preferences, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Calendar account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data.</p><p>When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to keep you logged in to Calendar. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Calendar account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.</p><p>To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from Calendar if your computer supports such capabilities.</p><p>You can opt out of receiving emails from us.</p><p>Please see the Your Rights and Choices section below.</p><h3></h3><h3>Cookie Policy</h3><p>Like many other websites, we may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications.</p><h5>We use cookie technologies to:</h5><ul><li>Recognize you as a customer.</li><li>Customize our Services, content, advertising, marketing, and targeting, and measure their effectiveness.</li><li>Help ensure that your account security is not compromised, mitigate risk and prevent fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Website and the Services.</li></ul><p>We may use both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device until you erase them or they expire. We may tie the information gathered to our users’ personally identifiable information.</p><p>Some browsers make it possible for you to signal that you don’t want your internet browsing activity to be tracked. There is currently no consensus on how to best honor these signals, so we don’t respond to “do not track” requests at this time. Declining our cookies may interfere with your use of our Services.</p><p>Our third-party partners also may employ cookies. The use of cookies by others is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p><h4>Other Web Site Analytics Services.</h4><p>Subject to your opt-out preferences (see Your Rights and Choices below), we use third party service providers such as Google Analytics to provide certain analytics and user interactions services to Calendar in connection with our operation of our Platform, including the collection and tracking of certain data and information regarding the characteristics and activities of visitors Calendar.</p><p>You may opt-out of Google Analytics’ and Mixpanel’s cookies using Opt-Out Features on their respective websites.</p><h3></h3><h3 class="subtitle">How We Protect And Store Personal Information</h3><p>We store and process your personal information using third party servers located in secure data centers in the United States, This information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We also use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our office and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</p><p>We make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that personal information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of our administrative, managerial and technical safeguards. Therefore, we urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your personal data as well, including never sharing your Calendar password with anyone.</p><p>If Calendar learns of a systems security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Calendar Service, you agree that Calendar may communicate with you electronically. Calendar may post a notice on the website if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice of a security breach) you should&nbsp;<a href="https://support.calendar.com/">notify us</a>.</p><h3></h3><h3 class="document-header">Users Outside the USA</h3><p>Our application and database servers are located with Amazon Cloud Services in the United States.
