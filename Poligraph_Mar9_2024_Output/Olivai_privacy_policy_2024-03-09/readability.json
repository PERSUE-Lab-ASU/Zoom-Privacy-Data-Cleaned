Your use of the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted will be considered to indicate your acceptance of the changes.</p><p>\u200d</p><p>\u200d</p><h2>What Information does Oliv Collect?</h2><h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3><p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. When you create a new account to use the Services we will solicit your consent to connect your Google account and/or Microsoft Office 365 and/or Microsoft Exchange and/or Slack account to your new Oliv account, thereby providing us with access to your account, including but not limited to Email, Contacts, and Calendar. Although the authentication provides broad access to your account, Oliv accesses and stores a subset of data from your account, including name, email address, calendar content, contacts, and company domain directory, to provide you with our Services.</p><p>\u200d</p><p>When you schedule a meeting using the Services we collect the recipients\u2019 name and email address so that we can display that information in the meeting invite, store it to enable some of the Services and for debugging purposes. Oliv collects the recipient\u2019s activities with regards to the meeting invite.</p><p>\u200d</p><p>In keeping with standard online privacy practices, users should not include any highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, financial information, or \u201cprotected health information\u201d (as that term is defined by the Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act)) in any meeting or meeting invite so that such data does not transfer to our servers (even if only temporarily).</p><p>\u200d</p><p>In addition, we collect Personal Information you submit to us, for example by completing a form on https://oliv.ai. In that case, we may communicate with you, for example by calling you at the phone number you provide, sending you promotional email offers, or emailing you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps enhance our engagement with you and generally improve our Services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:hi@oliv.ai\">hi@oliv.ai</a>.</p><p>\u200d</p><h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3><p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, \u201ccookie\u201d information, the type of browser and/or device you\u2019re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. \u201cCookies\u201d are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device\u2019s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.

Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience. Your browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked.</p><p>\u200d</p><h3>Information Collected From Third Party Integrations</h3><p>To provide integration functionality with third party services like Microsoft, Google, Zoom, etc, we may collect and store information about your credentials, configuration settings and other metadata that is stored in the third party services. This information is deleted when you request deletion of data for your account.</p><p>\u200d</p><h3>Third Party Analytics Services</h3><p>We use third party analytics services in order to better understand user engagement with the Services. When a user browses or uses the Services, these third party analytics services may collect the user\u2019s IP address, browser type, and approximate location (based on the IP address). They may also use web logs or web beacons and may set and access cookies on your computer or other device.
