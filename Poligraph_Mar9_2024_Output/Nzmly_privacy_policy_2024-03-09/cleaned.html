We take commercially reasonable measures and follow generally accepted standards to protect the information you provide us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, the information you provide is transmitted via encryption using technologies such as secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p><p class="fs-16">No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p><h3 class="fs-20">Accessing Your Information</h3><p class="fs-16">To review, correct, or update your customers' information, you can use the Nzmly CRM tool or you can update this information directly from Google Contacts. If you have chosen to synchronise your customer and contact data 2-way then the data will be updated both in Nzmly and Google Calendar &amp; Google Contacts no matter where you make the changes to. You may also decide to have just one-way synchronisation which limits the syncing process to only one medium - either Nzmly or Google Calendar &amp; Google Contacts.</p><p class="fs-16">We will retain the synced/imported information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with our services.</p><p class="fs-16">If you wish to close your account or request that we no longer use your Google Calendar &amp; Google Contacts information you can either disconnect the Google Calendar in the "Integration" sections of our web application, or if you want to delete all customer data that was imported to Nzmly simply delete your account in the "Dashboard" section of our web application. Please note that you first need to uninstall the Google Calendar App and then delete your account at Nzmly to avoid deleting all your events in Google.</p><h3 class="fs-20">Privacy Statement Updates</h3><p class="fs-16">We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our business or this app as it pertains to the information collected from you and our use of it. If the change impacts how we use or handle information collected from you, we will email you and/or your company’s Google administrator, or post a notice where you first access this app prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p></div></div><next-route-announcer></next-route-announcer></body></html>
