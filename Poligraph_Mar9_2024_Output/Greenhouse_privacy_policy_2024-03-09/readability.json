For purposes of this Privacy Policy, \u201c<strong>Personal Information</strong>\u201d means any information that is available to Greenhouse and that is protected explicitly by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation of 2016 (the \u201c<strong>EU GDPR</strong>\u201d); the EU GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of section 3 of the United Kingdom's European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the \"<strong>UK GDPR</strong>\"); and the California Consumer Protection Act \u201c<strong>CCPA</strong>\u201d), to the extent applicable. </p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about Greenhouse\u2019s collection and use of your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact details provided below. If however, your questions or concerns are related to a Greenhouse customer\u2019s collection and use of your Personal Information, please contact that customer directly. </p>\n<h2><strong><br>Scope of this policy</strong></h2>\n<p>Greenhouse is a leading provider of cloud-based software services that help companies manage and optimize their recruiting and hiring processes, located principally at 18 West 18th Street, 11th Fl., New York, New York 10011, USA. </p>\n<p>Our websites, products and services are designed for businesses and their representatives. We do not offer products or services for use by individuals for their personal, family or household purposes. Accordingly, we treat all Personal Information we collect as pertaining to individuals in their capacities as business representatives and not as individual consumers.</p>\n<p>Our customers are the controllers of the Personal Information they collect through Greenhouse\u2019s Services to manage their own recruiting and onboarding processes (<em>e.g.</em>, names, contact information, and other data collected as part of job applications), and each customer manages that Personal Information in accordance with its own privacy policies. Greenhouse\u2019s privacy commitments to our customers are governed by a separate customer agreement that authorizes us to collect, process, and store Personal Information on their behalf, as a processor under the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, and a service provider under the CCPA.

For example, if you apply to a job posted on a career page of a Greenhouse customer, your Personal Information will be automatically processed by Greenhouse on behalf of that customer. However, the company you applied to is the data controller (or business, as that term is defined in the CCPA) with respect to your Personal Information, and you should contact that entity directly with any questions you may have regarding its privacy policies or data processing practices, or if you wish to modify or access your Personal Information, restrict its processing, or delete it from our Services.
