    agreement that authorizes us to collect, process, and store Personal Information
    on their behalf, as a processor under the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, and a service
    provider under the CCPA.
  - However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only where we

  - We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate
    business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested
    or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
  - When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information,
    we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example,
    because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we
    will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further
    processing until deletion is possible.

    providers receive Personal Information that you may have provided, such as your
