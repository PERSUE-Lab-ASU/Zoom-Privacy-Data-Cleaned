WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e.,&nbsp;legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or&nbsp;fulfill&nbsp;our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to&nbsp;fulfill&nbsp;our legitimate business interests.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></strong></em></p>\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consent.&nbsp;</strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e.,&nbsp;consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about&nbsp;<a href=\"#withdrawconsent\">withdrawing your consent</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to&nbsp;fulfill&nbsp;our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyze&nbsp;how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><u><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></u></strong></p>\n<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.,&nbsp;express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,&nbsp;implied consent). You can&nbsp;<a href=\"#withdrawconsent\">withdraw your consent</a>&nbsp;at any time.</p>\n<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.

HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>\n<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins).

Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>\n<h4> Google API Services Disclosure</h4>\n<p>Convoke.ai uses Google\u2019s Application Programming Interface (API) Services to enable the user authorization feature for accessing the Convoke.ai platform (i.e. use of your Gmail account to login to the Convoke.ai platform). Convoke.ai\u2019s use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy\">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes\">Limited Use requirements.</a></p>\n<h4>Types of Data Collected with Google API Services</h4>\n<p>The information collected and used with these API services includes personal data such as email addresses.  Convoke.ai does use certain scopes to send email\u2019s on behalf of our users and we also use scopes to read the email address from the users account. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your email address.  We collect, use, and store Personal Data, as described within the practices below.</p>\n<h4>Use of Google API Services Data</h4>\n<p>Your Google information is used by our system developers to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent to your user experience. Convoke.ai policies and procedures define requirements that prohibit the unauthorized use of data within the platform.<br>\nIn order to perform improvement to the platform, developers may need to share your information with other development team members; however, Convoke.ai policies require that this type of sharing only be performed when (a) necessary to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent from the requesting app\u2019s user interface, (b) to comply with applicable laws, or (c) a part of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets of Convoke.ai. All other transfers or sales of user data are completely prohibited.<br>\nDevelopers are never allowed to use or transfer restricted scope data to serve users advertisements. This includes personalized, re-targeted and interest-based advertising.</p>\n<h4>Securing Your Data</h4>\n<p>Convoke.ai has established policies and procedures that define the appropriate safeguards for protecting your sensitive information. These safeguards include the implementation and use of security software, security processes, and a team of security professionals that manages and monitors the security of the Convoke.ai IT network and your sensitive data.</p>\n<h4>Data Privacy</h4>\n<p>We place significant importance on maintaining the security and privacy of your data. Reference our Privacy Policy for information on our privacy policies regarding the use of the Convoke.ai platform and its services.</p>\n<p><strong>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to&nbsp;fulfill&nbsp;the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>\n<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).&nbsp;No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than&nbsp;the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>\n<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or&nbsp;anonymize&nbsp;such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>\n<p><strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of&nbsp;organizational&nbsp;and technical security measures.</em></p>\n<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and&nbsp;organizational&nbsp;security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other&nbsp;unauthorized&nbsp;third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>\n<p><strong>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We do not knowingly collect data from or market to&nbsp;children under 18 years of age.</em></p>\n<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at&nbsp;ammon@convoke.ai.</p>\n<p><strong>10.
