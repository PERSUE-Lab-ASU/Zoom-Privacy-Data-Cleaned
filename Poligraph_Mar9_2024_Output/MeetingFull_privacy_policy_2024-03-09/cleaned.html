No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than three (12) months past the termination of the user’s account. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>



<p>See our security policy here: <a href="https://www.meetingfull.com/security/">https://www.meetingfull.com/security</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>



<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>. If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html</a>.

<p><strong>Opting out of email marketing:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below.

To otherwise opt-out, you may contact us using the contact information provided.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>



<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below. </p>



<p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with a Service, you have the right to request the removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request the removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h3>



<p><strong><em>In Short: </em></strong><em>Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em> </p>
