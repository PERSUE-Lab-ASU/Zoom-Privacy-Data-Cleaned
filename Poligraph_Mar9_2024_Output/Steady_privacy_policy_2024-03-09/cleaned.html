We may provide you with additional notices about other ways we process your Personal Information, such as sending you a notice via email or by other means of communication.</li>
<li><strong>Right to expect</strong> us to collect, use or disclose Personal Information responsibly and not for any other purpose other than which you consented. We set your expectations in this Privacy Policy, and we collect legally required consent at various stages of our interactions with you.

<h2>9. Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Steady is owned and operated in the United States and primarily uses technical infrastructure in the United States to provide the Services to our Customers wherever they are located. We must sometimes transfer data across jurisdictional boundaries to provide our Services to Customers located outside of the United States. As such, it is possible that your Personal Information may be transferred outside of your jurisdiction to the United States or other locations where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your Personal Information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country. If your information is in the US, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with US law.</p>
<p>Steady is committed to using lawful data transfer mechanisms for all cross-border transfers of Personal Information. For example, Steady has certified compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce for the collection, use, and retention of Data Subject Personal Information. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and instructed the EU Commission to develop and implement a new data transfer framework. Steady remains committed to subjecting all Data Subject Personal Information to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework’s applicable principles until a replacement framework is established. Until such time, we will rely on Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of Data Subject Personal Information or another appropriate legal basis for data transfers, where required. To the extent that Steady is deemed to transfer Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area, we do so on the legal basis that such transfer is necessary to provide you with the Services you have chosen to use. For more information, please review <a href="https://steady.space/gdpr">EU Data Protection and GDPR Compliance</a>.</p>
<p>By allowing us to collect Personal Information about you, you consent to the transfer and processing of your Personal Information as described in this section. We do not warrant that Steady is appropriate or authorized for use in any other jurisdictions. Customers and users are solely responsible for determining whether their use of the Services complies with applicable laws.</p>
<h2>10. Data Security</h2>
<p>Keeping your information secure is a top priority for Steady. To that end, we implement reasonable and appropriate security procedures and practices to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized or illegal access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. We maintain internal policies to govern the collection, processing, access, and handling of data, and Steady employees responsible for handling user inquiries are informed of applicable privacy law requirements. Please review our <a href="https://steady.space/security">Data Security</a> information for more details about our security practices.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that no transmission of data over the Internet or mobile platforms is 100% secure. We encourage you to take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your login and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your profile via unauthorized activity. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not defeat our security measures or use your Personal Information for improper purposes. The information you share in community forums may be viewed by any user. We urge you to be careful about giving out Personal Information in public areas of the Services.</p>
<h2>11. Third Party Websites</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Steady. We may provide links to third-party platforms for your convenience, but we have no ability to control, and we are not responsible for, the privacy and data collection, use, and disclosure practices of third-party platforms, including Business Subscribers’ platforms. Any access to and use of linked websites is not governed by this Privacy Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those platforms. Steady is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party.</p>
<h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat your Personal Information, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on this page. Your continued use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be your acceptance of those changes. The date that this Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically visiting this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.</p>
