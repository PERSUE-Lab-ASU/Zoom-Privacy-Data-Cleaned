<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-collection-and-use-of-personal-information-through-the-website">5. Collection and Use of Personal Information Through the Website&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Workleap generally collects and uses Personal Information from or about its website Users as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.1. Information Provided by Users.</strong> In many cases, Workleap collects Personal Information directly from Users when they visit or use the Website. For instance, Workleap may collect the following types of information:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.1.1. Inquiries and Requests for a Trial or Service.</strong> Workleap may collect Users’ name, contact information, email address and any other information provided when Users make an inquiry or contact Workleap through the Website, when Users sign up to receive Workleap’s newsletter or when Users submit a request or an order for an Workleap trial or service.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>5.1.2. </strong><strong>Personalization of Website</strong>. When Users visit the Website, they may, from time to time, be invited to provide information such as User’s title to help Workleap personalize or customize the Users experience when using the Website.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.2.</strong> <strong>Technical Information.</strong> When Users visit the Website, Workleap may collect, using electronic means such as cookies, technical information. This information may include information about visits to the Website, including the IP address of the Users’ computer and which browser was used to view the Website, the Users’ operating system, resolution of screen, location, language settings in browsers, the site the User came from, keywords searched (if arriving from a search engine), the number of page views, information entered, advertisements seen, etc. This data is used to measure and improve the effectiveness of the Website or enhance the experience for Users. While most of the time this information is depersonalized, if this information relates to an identifiable individual, Workleap will treat this information as Personal Information. Workleap may also, without limitations, collect and use the following type of information when Users visit and/or interact with Workleap or the Website:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.2.1. Google Analytics:</strong> Workleap uses Google Analytics which allows it to see information on User website activities including, but not limited to, page views, source and time spent on our Website. This information is depersonalized<strong> </strong>and is displayed as numbers, meaning that it cannot be tracked back to individuals. Users may opt-out of Workleap’s use of Google Analytics by visiting the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Analytics opt-out page</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>5.2.2. HubSpot:</strong> Workleap uses HubSpot which allows it to see information on User website activities including, but not limited to, page views, source and time spent on our Website. However, this information is not depersonalized and Users may not opt-out of Workleap’s use of HubSpot.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>5.2.3. Google AdWords:</strong> Workleap uses Google AdWords Remarketing to advertise Workleap across the Internet and to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors of the Website. AdWords remarketing will display ads to Users based on what parts of the Workleap Website they have viewed by placing a cookie on the Users’ web browser. It could mean that Workleap advertises to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on the Website or this could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. This cookie does not in any way identify the User or give access to the Users’ computer or mobile device. The cookie is only used to indicate to other websites that the User has visited a particular page on the Website, so that they may show the User ads relating to that page. If Users do not wish to participate in Google AdWords Remarketing, they can opt out by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/anonymous?sig=ACi0TCjdWMfU3lfsMB8h1Zo3epJGYa1PdSGjUG-HmdhICq4kkkwdk3JSyJKlkRHKnYDk49L76tvIqB_F_KMKQw3t_OBkijcTFwJcpflE_zGGTNJmfYk1qRk&amp;hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google’s Ads Preferences Manager</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>5.2.4.</strong> <strong>Interest-based Advertising.</strong> Workleap may also allow a limited number of trusted third parties to install cookies on Users’ hard drive from the Website. The Website may include third-party advertising and links to other websites which may be used to generate personalized advertisements. Personalized ads, sometimes referred to as interest-based or behavioral ads, are ads based upon information about Users, such as page views on the Website, information requests or purchases on the Website. Workleap does not provide any Personal Information to advertisers or to third party sites that display interest-based ads on the Website. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that Users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content displayed on the Website are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards. Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on the Website directly to Users’ browser. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. Workleap does not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by this Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. Users can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada. Please visit the&nbsp; <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAAC opt-out page</a> for more information.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.3.</strong> <strong>Choice with Cookies.</strong> Users can block the use of cookies by activating the settings in their browser. The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell Users how to prevent their browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify the Users when they receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If Users choose to withhold consent, or subsequently block cookies, they may not be able to access all or part of the content of the Website. Additionally, Users can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.4. Privacy Policies of other Websites.</strong> This Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by Workleap. Other websites that may be accessible through the Website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices.&nbsp;</p>

In the event Workleap receives a governmental or other regulatory request for any Personal Information, Workleap will promptly notify Customer, unless it is prohibited to do so, in order to allow Customer the option to defend such action. Workleap shall reasonably cooperate with Customer in such defense.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.4. </strong><strong>Business Transaction.</strong> Workleap may disclose Personal Information to a third party in connection with a sale or transfer of business or assets, an amalgamation, re-organization or financing of parts of our business.

Subject to applicable laws, Users also have the right to: (i) access and rectification or erasure of Personal Information, to the extent that Workleap may need to retain certain Personal Information, including for record keeping purposes or to comply with legal obligations; (ii) restrict or object Workleap’s use of Personal Information (though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services or the Website) where Workleap is relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about User’s particular situation which impacts on User’s fundamental rights and freedoms; (iii) lodge a complaint with their local data protection authority (contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/document.cfm?action=display&amp;doc_id=50061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>); and (iv) data portability.
