Workleap may also, without limitations, collect and use the following type of information when Users visit and/or interact with Workleap or the Website:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>5.2.1. Google Analytics:</strong> Workleap uses Google Analytics which allows it to see information on User website activities including, but not limited to, page views, source and time spent on our Website. This information is depersonalized<strong> </strong>and is displayed as numbers, meaning that it cannot be tracked back to individuals.

AdWords remarketing will display ads to Users based on what parts of the Workleap Website they have viewed by placing a cookie on the Users\u2019 web browser. It could mean that Workleap advertises to previous visitors who haven\u2019t completed a task on the Website or this could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. This cookie does not in any way identify the User or give access to the Users\u2019 computer or mobile device.

Workleap does not provide any Personal Information to advertisers or to third party sites that display interest-based ads on the Website. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that Users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content displayed on the Website are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards. Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on the Website directly to Users\u2019 browser. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. Workleap does not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by this Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

Workleap (or third parties acting on Workleap\u2019s behalf) may transfer Personal Information that Workleap collects to countries outside of the European Economic Area. Where such transfer occurs, Workleap will take steps to ensure that Personal Information is protected. Workleap will make such transfers only if at least one of the following conditions are present:\u00a0\n\nWorkleap has entered into a contract based on the \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d, provided that such contract, combined with technical and organizational measures, offers appropriate safeguards for the rights of the individuals whose personal data is being transferred;\u00a0\nSuch transfer is governed by \u201cBinding Corporate Rules\u201d, which have been approved by data protection authorities; or\u00a0\nSuch transfer is covered by a European Union Commission \u201cadequacy decision\u201d.

Collection and Use of Personal Information Through the Website\u00a0\nWorkleap generally collects and uses Personal Information from or about its website Users as follows:\u00a0\n5.1. Information Provided by Users. In many cases, Workleap collects Personal Information directly from Users when they visit or use the Website. For instance, Workleap may collect the following types of information:\u00a0\n\n5.1.1. Inquiries and Requests for a Trial or Service. Workleap may collect Users\u2019 name, contact information, email address and any other information provided when Users make an inquiry or contact Workleap through the Website, when Users sign up to receive Workleap\u2019s newsletter or when Users submit a request or an order for an Workleap trial or service.\u00a0\n5.1.2. Personalization of Website. When Users visit the Website, they may, from time to time, be invited to provide information such as User\u2019s title to help Workleap personalize or customize the Users experience when using the Website.\u00a0\n\n5.2. Technical Information. When Users visit the Website, Workleap may collect, using electronic means such as cookies, technical information. This information may include information about visits to the Website, including the IP address of the Users\u2019 computer and which browser was used to view the Website, the Users\u2019 operating system, resolution of screen, location, language settings in browsers, the site the User came from, keywords searched (if arriving from a search engine), the number of page views, information entered, advertisements seen, etc. This data is used to measure and improve the effectiveness of the Website or enhance the experience for Users. While most of the time this information is depersonalized, if this information relates to an identifiable individual, Workleap will treat this information as Personal Information. Workleap may also, without limitations, collect and use the following type of information when Users visit and/or interact with Workleap or the Website:\u00a0\n\n5.2.1. Google Analytics: Workleap uses Google Analytics which allows it to see information on User website activities including, but not limited to, page views, source and time spent on our Website. This information is depersonalized and is displayed as numbers, meaning that it cannot be tracked back to individuals. Users may opt-out of Workleap\u2019s use of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page.\u00a0\n5.2.2. HubSpot: Workleap uses HubSpot which allows it to see information on User website activities including, but not limited to, page views, source and time spent on our Website.

Google AdWords: Workleap uses Google AdWords Remarketing to advertise Workleap across the Internet and to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors of the Website. AdWords remarketing will display ads to Users based on what parts of the Workleap Website they have viewed by placing a cookie on the Users\u2019 web browser. It could mean that Workleap advertises to previous visitors who haven\u2019t completed a task on the Website or this could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. This cookie does not in any way identify the User or give access to the Users\u2019 computer or mobile device. The cookie is only used to indicate to other websites that the User has visited a particular page on the Website, so that they may show the User ads relating to that page. If Users do not wish to participate in Google AdWords Remarketing, they can opt out by visiting Google\u2019s Ads Preferences Manager.\u00a0\n5.2.4. Interest-based Advertising. Workleap may also allow a limited number of trusted third parties to install cookies on Users\u2019 hard drive from the Website. The Website may include third-party advertising and links to other websites which may be used to generate personalized advertisements. Personalized ads, sometimes referred to as interest-based or behavioral ads, are ads based upon information about Users, such as page views on the Website, information requests or purchases on the Website. Workleap does not provide any Personal Information to advertisers or to third party sites that display interest-based ads on the Website. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that Users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content displayed on the Website are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards. Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on the Website directly to Users\u2019 browser. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. Workleap does not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by this Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

If Users choose to withhold consent, or subsequently block cookies, they may not be able to access all or part of the content of the Website. Additionally, Users can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, by changing the add-on\u2019s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.\u00a0\n5.4.
