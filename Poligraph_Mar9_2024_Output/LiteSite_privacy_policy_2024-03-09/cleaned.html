This Privacy Policy governs your (the “User,” also referred to herein as “you” or “your” or “Customer”) use of the LiteSite website and service (collectively, the “Service”) operated by LiteSite (“we,” “our” or “us").<br></p><p>LiteSite has three different types of Users, depending on how you interact with the Service. It is possible that you may use LiteSite in different ways. If so, please review all applicable terms.<br>‍<strong>Subscribers.</strong> Users who use the Service as part of any tier of a LiteSite subscription plan are called “Subscribers.” The Service features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the specific terms agreed to between LiteSite and the organization (e.g., your employer, event planner, or another entity or person, called the “Customer”) that entered into a separate agreement that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (for purpose of this Policy, the “Terms of Service”). The Customer controls its instance of the Service and is the data controller of the information collected through the Service about Subscribers, and LiteSite is a data processor of such information.<br>‍<strong>Invitees.</strong> “Invitees” are people who have scheduled an appointment with a LiteSite User but may or may not have an account with LiteSite. While Invitees can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Subscribers. LiteSite is the data controller of the information collected through the Service about Invitees.<br>‍<strong>Site Visitors.</strong> We call users of the Website “Site Visitors.” Site Visitors can be individuals who are simply browsing the Websites but who do not use the Service. Site Visitors can also be Invitees or Subscribers who visit the Websites to seek additional information about LiteSite. LiteSite is the data controller of the information collected through the Website about Site Visitors.<br></p><h2><strong>Privacy Terms for Subscribers</strong></h2><p>Collection and Use of Subscriber Information</p><p>This section explains the information we collect from Subscribers. We do not require Subscribers to provide us with information. However, certain information, such as account log-in data, is required to provide you with access to the Service, and other information may be collected automatically as you use the Service.<br>‍<strong>User Content.</strong> User Content is collected, used, and shared by LiteSite in accordance with the Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Terms of Service, or as required by applicable law. The Subscriber, and not LiteSite, determines its own, internal policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of User Content which may apply to your use of the Service. For example, a Subscriber may provide or remove access to the Service, manage appointments, account settings, or share events. Please check with the Subscriber about the policies and settings that they have instituted with respect to the User Content that you provide when using the Service.<br>‍<strong>Account Information. Service Usage Information.</strong> As you use the Service, we collect information about how you use and interact with the Service (“Service Usage Information”).

We may also collect your MAC address and other unique device identifiers.<br>Log files – when you use the Service, our servers automatically record information in server log files. These log files may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type and settings, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, date and time stamp information, language preferences, data from cookies and similar technologies, and other such information.Location information – we collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).<br>Account Use Metadata – when you interact with the Service, metadata is generated that provides high-level (non-content) information about the way you work in your Account.<br>‍<strong>Other Information.</strong> You may provide us with information when you interact with us in other ways, such as when you submit requests or questions to us via forms or email (e.g., support forms, sales forms, user research participation forms); and requests for customer support and technical assistance (collectively, “Other Information”).<br>‍<strong>Information Collected from Third-Party Integrations.</strong> If you choose to use or connect to third-party integrations (e.g., Google Calendar) through the Service, or if you are required or permitted to do so by a Subscriber, such third parties may allow us to have access to and store additional information about your interaction with those services as it relates to your use of the Service. If you initiate these connections, you also understand that we will share information about you that is required to enable your use of the third-party integration through the Service. If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not initiate these connections. By enabling these connections, you authorize us to connect and access the information provided through these connections, and you understand that the privacy policies of these third parties govern such connections.<br></p><p>How Does LiteSite Use Subscriber Information?<br></p><p>This section describes how LiteSite uses the information we collect from Subscribers.<br>‍<strong>User Content.</strong> LiteSite may view and use User Content collected from and about Subscribers only as necessary:<br>To maintain, provide and improve the Service<br>To prevent or address technical or security issues and resolve support requests<br>To investigate when we have a good faith belief, or have received a complaint alleging, that such User Content is in violation of the Terms of service<br>To comply with a valid legal subpoena, request, or other lawful process that meets the requirements of the Customer Agreement and our Law Enforcement Guidelines<br>As otherwise set forth in our Terms of Service or as expressly permitted in writing by the Customer<br>‍<strong>Account Information, Service Usage Information, Information from Third Party Integrations, and Other Information.</strong> LiteSite may use these categories of information collected from and about Subscribers to:<br>Maintain, provide, and improve the Service<br>Respond to your requests for information<br>Prevent or address technical or security issues and resolve support requests<br>Investigate in good faith alleged violations of our User Terms of Service<br>Comply with a valid legal subpoena, request, or other lawful process that meets the requirements of our Law Enforcement Guidelines<br>Help us better understand user interests and needs, and customize the Service for our users<br>Engage in analysis, research, and reports regarding use of the Service<br>Protect the Service and our users<br>Communicate with you via email or SMS text messages and through the Service about important notices and updates regarding the Service<br>In accordance with applicable legal obligations, communicate with you about promotions, offers, and news about LiteSite.

We will also keep records of the communication, the question/request you raised, and how it was resolved.<br>‍<strong>Websites Usage Information.</strong> As you browse the Websites, we and our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf to provide and enhance the Websites) use a variety of technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting information about how you use the Websites. For example, our servers automatically record certain information in server logs. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type and settings, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Websites, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, mobile device identifiers and information about the device you are using to access the Websites, date and time stamp information and other such information.<br>‍<strong>Location Information.</strong> We collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).<br>‍<strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> We and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. An SDK is a section of code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Websites. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer and login session; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand which pages of the Websites you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, email open rates, measure popularity of the Websites and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.
