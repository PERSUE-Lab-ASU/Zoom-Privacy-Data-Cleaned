										<p>The Claris Privacy Policy was updated December 22, 2022.</p>
										<p>Your privacy is important to Claris International Inc. and Claris International (UK) (“Claris,” “we,” or “our”). We’ve developed this Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, and share personal information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@claris.com">privacy@claris.com</a> if you have any questions.</p>

										<h2 class="h5">What is Personal Information at Claris?</h2>
										<p>Claris treats any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Claris as “personal information,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies a person — such as a name — is personal information, and also data that does not directly identify a person, but that can reasonably be used to identify a person, is personal information. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
										<p>Our products are primarily used by businesses (our “Customers”). With respect to any personal information that is uploaded by Customers to our products and services, Claris acts as a “Data Processor” (or “Service Provider”) to these Customers as defined under applicable privacy or data protection laws, which may include the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Claris acts as a “Data Controller” (or “Business”) as defined under applicable privacy or data protection laws for other personal information that it collects for its own business purposes from Customers and other individuals, such as contact information for Customer employees that interact with Claris.</p>	
										<p>This Privacy Policy applies where Claris acts as a “Data Controller” or a “Business” under applicable privacy or data protection laws.</p>

										<h2 class="h5">Personal Information Claris Collects from You</h2>
											<p>The personal information Claris collects depends on how you interact with Claris. For example, you may be asked to provide personal information when you are in contact with Claris or a Claris affiliated company about a product or service, and when you are the purchaser of a Claris product or service. Claris and its affiliates may combine your personal information with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information requested. However, if you chose not to do so, in many cases you will not be able to access our products or services.</p>
                    	<p>When you register and/or use our products, purchase a product, download a software trial or an update, download a solution or app, participate in a forum, register for a webinar or other event, contact us, including by social media, participate in an online survey, or otherwise interact with Claris, we may collect and/or receive a variety of information, including:</p>

										<h2 class="h5">Claris’s Use of Personal Information</h2>
										<p>Claris uses the personal information to power our services, process transactions, communicate with our Customers, and comply with the law, as well as for security and fraud prevention. We may also use personal information for other purposes with your consent.</p>
										<p>Claris uses your personal information only when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Depending on the circumstance, Claris may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, or to comply with the law. We may also process personal information where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@claris.com">privacy@claris.com</a>.</p>
										<ul class="bulleted">
											<li><strong>Power Our Services.</strong> We use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, and content. We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve our services, including the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address. We may also use personal information for internal purposes, such as understanding Customer behavior, auditing, data analysis, and research.</li>
											<li><strong>Process Your Transactions.</strong> We use personal information to process transactions for products or services that you have requested.</li>
											<li><strong>Communicate with You.</strong> The personal information we collect allows us to respond to communications, market our products and services, and keep our Customers posted on Claris’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can click the unsubscribe link in the communication itself. If you are a Claris Customer, you can also opt out any time by <a href="//content.claris.com/subscribe" data-link-id="L426">updating your preferences</a>. Note that from time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Claris, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices.</li>
											<li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention.</strong> We use personal information for anti-fraud purposes. We may use personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use information for anti-fraud purposes, it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our Customers, users, and services. For certain online transactions, we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.</li>
											<li><strong>Promotions.</strong> If you enter into a sweepstakes, contest, or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.</li>
											<li><strong>Job Applications.</strong> If you apply for a position at Claris or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Claris and may use your information for (i) processing your application for the specific position you have applied for, (ii) processing your application for other open positions within Claris which may be suitable to you, and (iii) seeking your views in relation to your candidate experience. If you do not wish to participate in talent research surveys, please email <a href="mailto:recruiting-survey-opt-out@apple.com">recruiting-survey-opt-out@apple.com</a>. Applicant data is subject to the Candidate Privacy Policy available at jobs.apple.com.</li>
											<li><strong>Comply with Law.</strong> We use personal information to comply with applicable law – for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request — and for other compliance purposes such as license compliance verification.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Claris does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you. Claris also does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.</p>
										<p>Where Claris acts as a Data Controller, we retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal information collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal information for the shortest possible period permissible under law. Where Claris acts as a Data Processor, we retain personal information for as long as specified in the data processing terms with our Customers.</p>

										<h2 class="h5">Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>
										<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. For example, we may collect information regarding customer activity on our website and Claris Store and from our other products and services. This information may be aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers, to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest, and to improve and optimize our products and services.</p>
										<p>If we combine non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

										<h2 class="h5">Claris’s Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
										<p>Claris may share personal information with affiliated companies, service providers and contractors who act on our behalf, at your direction such as where permitted or requested by you, or where required by law.</p>
										<h3 class="h6">Service Providers and Contractors</h3>
										<p>Claris may engage third parties to act as our service providers, contractors, or subprocessors, including to perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products, managing customer data, providing customer service, assessing interest in our products and services, marketing, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. Claris’s service providers, contractors, and subprocessors are obligated to handle personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy, according to our instructions, and in accordance with relevant laws. They cannot use the personal information we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal information once they've fulfilled our request.</p>
										<h3 class="h6">Others</h3>
										<p>Claris may share personal information with others at your direction or with your consent, for example if you download a third party partner’s app from the Claris Marketplace. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions, or to protect our operations or Customers, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.</p>

										<p>When you use some Claris products, services, or applications or post on a Claris forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.

If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 years, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information.

										<h2 class="h5">Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
										<p>Claris’s website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.</p>
										<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Claris website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.</p>
										<p>In some email messages Claris sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Claris website. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.</p>
										<p>Claris generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information in those regions. In addition, Claris sometimes combines non-personal information collected from these technologies with other personal information Claris holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>

										<p>Claris’s international transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is governed by <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" data-link-id="L640">Standard Contractual Clauses</a>. </p>

										<h2 class="h5">Your Privacy Rights</h2>
										<p>At Claris, we respect your rights with regard to your personal information, which may include the ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal information depending on your jurisdiction. If you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Claris. <strong>Please note that Claris does not sell personal information</strong>.</p>
										<p>To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may exercise your privacy rights and choices by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@claris.com">privacy@claris.com</a>. To exercise your privacy rights over personal information for which Claris acts as a Data Processor, please contact the Claris Customer that collected your personal information. We will forward any such communications to the applicable Claris Customer.</p>
										<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by contacting Claris Customer Support at the toll-free number listed below.</p>
										<p>There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Claris is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.</p>
