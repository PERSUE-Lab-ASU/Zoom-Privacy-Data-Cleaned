We may also use personal information for other purposes with your consent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris uses your personal information only when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Depending on the circumstance, Claris may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, or to comply with the law. We may also process personal information where we believe it is in our or others\u2019 legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact us at privacy@claris.com.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPower Our Services. We use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, and content.

We use personal information to process transactions for products or services that you have requested.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCommunicate with You.

Because this information is important to your interaction with Claris, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSecurity and Fraud Prevention. We use personal information for anti-fraud purposes. We may use personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use information for anti-fraud purposes, it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our Customers, users, and services. For certain online transactions, we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPromotions. If you enter into a sweepstakes, contest, or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Applications.

If you do not wish to participate in talent research surveys, please email recruiting-survey-opt-out@apple.com. Applicant data is subject to the Candidate Privacy Policy available at jobs.apple.com.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComply with Law. We use personal information to comply with applicable law \u2013 for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request \u2014 and for other compliance purposes such as license compliance verification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you. Claris also does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhere Claris acts as a Data Controller, we retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal information collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal information for the shortest possible period permissible under law. Where Claris acts as a Data Processor, we retain personal information for as long as specified in the data processing terms with our Customers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. For example, we may collect information regarding customer activity on our website and Claris Store and from our other products and services. This information may be aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers, to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest, and to improve and optimize our products and services.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf we combine non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris\u2019s Sharing of Personal Information\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris may share personal information with affiliated companies, service providers and contractors who act on our behalf, at your direction such as where permitted or requested by you, or where required by law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tService Providers and Contractors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris may engage third parties to act as our service providers, contractors, or subprocessors, including to perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products, managing customer data, providing customer service, assessing interest in our products and services, marketing, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. Claris\u2019s service providers, contractors, and subprocessors are obligated to handle personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy, according to our instructions, and in accordance with relevant laws. They cannot use the personal information we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal information once they've fulfilled our request.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOthers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris may share personal information with others at your direction or with your consent, for example if you download a third party partner\u2019s app from the Claris Marketplace. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions, or to protect our operations or Customers, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProtection of Personal Information at Claris\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the processing, and the threats posed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you use some Claris products, services, or applications or post on a Claris forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.

We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 years, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information. If you believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at privacy@claris.com.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCookies and Other Technologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris\u2019s website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \u201ccookies\u201d and other technologies such as web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you want to disable cookies and you\u2019re using the Safari web browser, choose \u201cBlock all cookies\u201d in Safari\u2019s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Claris website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn some email messages Claris sends to you, we provide a \u201cclick-through URL\u201d that links you to content on the Claris website. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information in those regions. In addition, Claris sometimes combines non-personal information collected from these technologies with other personal information Claris holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThird-Party Sites and Services\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.

If you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Claris. Please note that Claris does not sell personal information.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may exercise your privacy rights and choices by contacting privacy@claris.com. To exercise your privacy rights over personal information for which Claris acts as a Data Processor, please contact the Claris Customer that collected your personal information. We will forward any such communications to the applicable Claris Customer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by contacting Claris Customer Support at the toll-free number listed below.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere may be situations where we cannot grant your request \u2014 for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Claris is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Questions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you have questions about personal information you have provided to Claris, Claris\u2019s Privacy Policy or privacy practices, including our role as a Data Processor or Service Provider, or if you would like to submit a complaint, you can contact us at privacy@claris.com or by phone to Claris Customer Support at 1-800-325-2747.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaris takes your privacy questions seriously.
