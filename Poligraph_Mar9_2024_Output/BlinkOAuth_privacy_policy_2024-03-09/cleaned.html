IN THESE CASES, IF YOU CHOOSE TO WITHHOLD OR DELETE ANY PII REQUESTED BY US, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO ACCESS CERTAIN SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p><p>We recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the software, services, information, tools, features, data and functionality available on the Website offered by Blink ("<strong>Services</strong>") and covers how PII that the Blink collects and receives, including in respect of any use of the Services, is treated. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at: privacy@blinkops.com.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. PII We Collect and How We Use It. </h2><p>In order to provide, operate, maintain and improve our Services, to understand usage trends and user preferences in order to adjust and personalize your use of the Services, for marketing and customer relations purposes, to offer and operate webinars and demos related to our Services, and for recruitment and placement purposes, to participate in our public forums, in order to protect our Services from threatening activities, for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or for enforcement of the relevant agreement or other legal rights, we may collect and process PII, including the following types of information:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>PII You Provide. </strong>For some of the features of the Services we ask you to provide PII, including full name and e-mail address.</li><li><strong>Third Parties.</strong> We sometimes supplement or verify the PII that you provide with information that is received from third parties. If you interact with any social media or other third-party plug-in or platform in the Services, we may receive information from those respective platforms.</li><li><strong>User Communications. </strong>When you send an email or other communication to Blink, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services. We may send you web push notifications to send you news and updates in respect of the Services. We may also send you newsletters, updates and promotional communications. You may opt-out of this service at any time by clicking on the removal from the distribution list link at the bottom of each communication.</li><li><strong>User PII.</strong> When you use the Services, we may automatically receive and record information from your browser, including without limitation information and statistics about your online or offline status, your IP address, internet service provider, search history, cookie information, type of browser, your regional and language settings and software and hardware attributes. Our systems may automatically record and store technical information regarding the method and nature of your use of the Services, including without limitation which pages of the Services you viewed, exit and entrance pages and your use time of the Services. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your device on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. Blink uses all the PII that it collects to understand the usage trends, interests, behavior and preferences of its users.</li><li><strong>Aggregate and Analytical Data. </strong>In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the customers of the Services, we often conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the PII and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</li></ol><h2>2. Cookies and Web Beacons.</h2><p>In order to collect or use the data described herein, we may use temporary cookies that remain on your device's cookies file for a limited period of time. We may also use persistent cookies that remain on your device's cookies file until the cookies are removed via your browser's settings in order to manage and maintain the Services and record your use of the Services and to understand the usage trends and preferences of our users. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to and stored on your device. Cookies do not damage your device. Most browsers may allow you to block cookies, but you may not be able to use some features on the Services if you block them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie (this enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not). We may also use web beacons via the Services to collect information. Web beacons or “gifs” are electronic images that may be used in our Services or in our emails. We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. We also use third party technologies, such as cookies and web beacons and third-party providers to process and analyze your PII for analytics.</p><h2>3. Links. </h2><p>Links to third party services, sites, content, features and applications may be provided by Blink as a convenience to our users. Blink is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those third-party services, sites, content, features and applications and you visit them at your own risk. This Privacy Policy applies solely to PII collected or used by us.</p><h2>4. Children.</h2><p>If you are a child under the age of 18, you must obtain parental consent prior to using our Services. Blink will not knowingly contact or engage with children under the age of 18 without said parental consent. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided us with their PII, please contact us at the address given above and we will endeavor to delete that PII from our databases.</p><h2>5. Information Sharing.</h2><p>Blink may share PII in the following circumstances: (a) when we process PII on behalf of our business customers, we share that information with them, in which event except for de-identified and aggregate information, which we control, we are merely the processors of your PII on behalf of our business customers who collect and process your PII. We require them to do so in accordance with applicable law, but we do not control their actions and therefore you are advised to review their privacy policies; (b) as required for the provision, maintenance and improvement of the Services; (c) when permitted by you; (d) if we become involved in a reorganization, merger, consolidation, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, with any type of entity, whether public, private, foreign or local; (e) to satisfy applicable law or prevention of fraud or harm, to enforce applicable agreements and/or their terms, including investigation of potential violations thereof; and/or (f) for processing PII on our behalf by our affiliates, agents, third party service providers, subcontractors and representatives. We require that our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons processing PII on our behalf agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We further note that the Service’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use Requirements. </p><p>Please note that, notwithstanding the foregoing, <strong>Blink will not share any data with third party AI models</strong>.</p><h2>6. PII Security and Retention.</h2><p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of PII. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We retain your PII only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.</p><h2>7. Data Integrity.</h2><p>Blink processes PII only for the purposes for which it was collected or used and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service agreements. We review our data collection, usage, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, use, store and process the PII needed to provide or improve our Services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the PII we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their PII whenever necessary. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is interpreted as an obligation to store information, and we may, at our own discretion, delete or avoid from recording and storing any and all information.</p><h2>8. Your Rights.</h2><ol role="list"><li><strong>Right of Access and Rectification</strong>. You have the right to know what PII we collect about you and to ensure that such data is accurate and relevant for the purposes for which we collected it. We allow our users the option to access and obtain a copy of their PII and to rectify such PII if it is not accurate, complete or updated. However we may first ask you to provide us certain credentials to permit us to identify your PII.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Right to Delete PII or Restrict Processing</strong>. You have the right to delete your PII or restrict its processing. We may postpone or deny your request if your PII is in current use for the purposes for which it was collected or for other legitimate purposes such as compliance with legal obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent</strong>. You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your PII. Exercising this right will not affect the lawfulness of processing your PII based on your consent before its withdrawal.</li><li><strong>Right of Data Portability</strong>. Where technically feasible, you have the right to ask to transfer your PII in accordance with your right to data portability.&nbsp;</li><li>You may exercise the above rights by sending a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@blinkops.com">privacy@blinkops.com</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Right to Request Information on Transfers</strong>.&nbsp; You have the right to request certain details of the basis on which your PII is transferred outside the European Economic Area. Please be aware that certain information relating to such transfers may be partially redacted or restricted due to&nbsp; data transfer agreements or reasons relating to commercial confidentiality.</li><li><strong>Right to Lodge Complaint</strong>. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority regarding the processing of your PII.</li></ol><h2>9. Enforcement.</h2><p>Blink regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or our treatment of PII by contacting us as provided above. When we receive formal written complaints, it is Blink's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of PII that cannot be resolved between Blink and an individual.</p><h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy.</h2><p>Blink may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat PII by sending a notice to the email address provided by you or placing a prominent notice on the Services. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy for the latest information about our privacy practices.</p><h2>11. Consent To Processing.</h2><p>By providing any PII to us pursuant to this Privacy Policy, all users, including, without limitation, users in the United States, Israel and member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the collection, usage and/or processing of such PII abroad. The server on which the Services are hosted and/or through which the Services are processed may be outside the country from which you access the Services and may be outside your country of residence. Some of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Policy may involve the transfer of your PII to various countries around the world that may have different levels of privacy protection than your country and may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). If there is a transfer of your PII outside the EEA we will, in the absence of an EC Adequacy decision relevant to the destination country or to the transfer, seek to rely on appropriate safeguards such as to enter into appropriate EC approved standard contractual clauses. By submitting your PII through the Services, you consent, acknowledge, and agree that we may collect, use, transfer, and disclose your PII as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>12. Your California Privacy Rights and Do Not Track Notices.</h2><p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Blink who are California residents to request certain information regarding disclosure of PII to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us using the contact details published on our Services. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year. You are also advised that Blink does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals.</p><h2>13. Your California Privacy Rights and Do Not Track Notices.</h2><p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or concerns about the way we process your PII, please contact us at: privacy@blinkops.com.</p><p>Last Updated:&nbsp;November 21, 2023.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></article></div></div></div></div></div></div>
