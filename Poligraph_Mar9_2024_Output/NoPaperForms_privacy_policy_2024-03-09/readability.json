Most browsers automatically accept\n                    cookies, but you have the option to change your browser settings to decline them. We use cookies to\n                    deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so that you do not have to\n                    re-enter it each time that you visit our Website (if you choose), and for other purposes.\n            \n        \n                Website Tracking Software\n                Web servers, or those of third-party vendors, utilize certain tracking software to capture your\n                    domain name address (the address of your Internet service provider) for purposes of tracking Website\n                    statistics. However, we do not capture any personally identifiable information in our website\n                    tracking software. The capture of\n                    your domain name is a common practice among websites for measuring the number of hits, pages\n                    visited,\n                    and length of user session. We use this information to measure the effectiveness of the Website\n                    offerings in\n                    order to service you better.\n            \n\n        \n                Field Force Location Tracking on NoPaperForms Mobile App\n                The app asks the user\u2019s consent for recording their location. If the user chooses to allow it, the\n                    app captures their location when they check in and check out on the app. The location is captured\n                    every 30 minutes\n                    while the app is running in the background. This is done for partners to\n                    know when and where their field agents are spending their working\n                    hours. It stops when the user has checked out in the app. All of this\n                    happens only if the partner institution has requested for this feature. It is disabled by default.\n                \n\n\n                This information is exclusively shared with our partners who have\n                    requested it and will be used only for mapping user locations. Users may\n                    disable the mobile application's access to this information at any time\n                    by editing the settings on their mobile device. The data stored on the\n                    mobile device and their location information to which the mobile\n                    application have access will be used in the context of the mobile\n                    application, and transferred to and associated with your account in the\n                    corresponding services (in which case the data will be stored on our\n                    servers) or products (in which case the data will remain with you unless\n                    you share it with us).\n            \n\n\n        \n                Google Calendar Access on NoPaperForms Mobile App\n                The Google Calendar access is used to synchronize the follow-up events for a user on the NoPaperForms\n                    Mobile App. The user can also access his follow ups directly on Google Calendar. The user receives a\n                    notification on the app before the scheduled follow-up event. The user\u2019s email address is never used\n                    or saved by NoPaperForms nor is it sent to any third party. The user can turn this feature off from\n                    the Mobile App should they choose to do so. By default, the feature is disabled.\n            \n        \n                Your Privacy Choices\n                We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used\n                    for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.
