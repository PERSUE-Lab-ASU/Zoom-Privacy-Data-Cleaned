We want our Customers and their Authorized Users (collectively, our \u201cCustomer(s)\u201d) and Candidates (\u201cCandidate(s)\u201d) to have a positive experience while using the Site or Apps. We respect and protect our Customers\u2019 and Candidates\u2019 rights to privacy as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to both the Site and the Apps and other platforms where this Privacy Policy is posted.\n\nTo provide some background to our Customers and Candidates, we primarily process Personal Information (defined below) on behalf of and in accordance with the instructions of our Customers, who may collect such information from Candidates during the employment recruitment process or otherwise. In addition, we act as a data controller with respect to some Candidate Personal Information that we make available to our Customers upon authorization from such Candidates. We and our Customers collect such information from Candidates using the Site or the Apps. We also work with partners, who obtain information from Candidates, and offer this information to our Customers. The Personal Information from the Candidate(s) is concurrently and automatically stored and backed up from the Site and/or the Apps to servers that are under the control and in the possession of our hosting provider, who acts as our sub-processor. It is important to note that the provision of Personal Information by Customers or Candidates is not mandatory, and Customers and Candidates can refrain from such provision at any time and still maintain access to the Site and Apps.\n\nWe may modify this Privacy Notice at any time. All changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the Site. Material changes will be conspicuously posted on the Site or otherwise communicated to you.\n\n<b>Click on the links below to jump to each section:</b></p><ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"#1\"><b><i>How do we collect Candidate and Customer Personal Information?</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#2\"><b><i>What Personal Information do we collect?</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#3\"><b><i>How do we use Customer Personal Information?</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#4\"><b><i>How do we use Candidate Personal Information?</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#5\"><b><i>Do we disclose any Personal Information to outside parties?</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#6\"><b><i>What choices do you have about your Personal Information?</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#7\"><b><i>Location of our Site</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#8\"><b><i>How long do we retain your Personal Information?</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#9\"><b><i>Third party links</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#10\"><b><i>How do we protect your information?</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#11\"><b><i>Your California privacy rights</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#12\"><b><i>European residents</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#13\"><b><i>Do we collect Personal Information from children?</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#14\"><b><i>Contacting us</i></b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"#15\"><b><i>Changes to our Privacy Policy</i></b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"1\">How do we collect Candidate and Customer Personal Information?</h2><p>\nYello collects Personal Information relating to Candidates and Customers\u2019 use of the Site and Apps in the following ways:\n</p><ul>\n \t<li><b>Directly from Customers.</b>&nbsp;We collect information from our Customers when they sign up to use our services or interact with us.</li>\n \t<li><b>Directly from Candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We collect information from Candidates when they register an account with us, request information, send us email, send us postal mail, speak with us on the telephone, or otherwise interact with us.&nbsp; When Candidates register an account on our Site or Apps, Candidates will be prompted to give their consent to our processing of their Personal Information.

We collect Candidate Personal Information when Candidates register on the Site and enter their Personal Information and/or upload their resume. We may collect sensitive Personal Information of Candidates such as ethnic origin, race, religion, and gender. Our Customers and sourcing partners may also transfer Candidate Personal Information to us to enable us to share such Personal Information with our other Customers for recruitment and hiring purposes. Our sourcing partners may collect and share Personal Information, including sensitive Personal Information of Candidates such as ethnic origin, race, religion, and gender.\n</p><h3>Employment Information</h3><p>\nIf you apply for employment with us or through us, we will collect your employment and work history, as well as other Personal Information related to your potential employment. This may include your education and employment history, address and contact information, demographic information, and any other information included in your resume or application.

Through use of the Site and/or Apps, we may also collect Personal Information directly from Yello Customers who provide their Personal Information to Yello for marketing purposes. If our Customers utilize Yello owned devices in connection with the Apps or the Site, we may track such iPads or tablets, and you, as a U.S. based Customer, consent to us tracking such iPads or tablets using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology that is installed and active on such device(s). Such tracking will be utilized for the following purposes: (i) locating device(s) in the event that they are lost or stolen; and/or (ii) locating devices(s) in an anonymized fashion for use on a device heat-map to be used for internal and external marketing purposes and which constitutes a map of broad-scale user activity across the globe. Such GPS tracking will not involve any access to your Personal Information nor will it involve the tracking of your activity or behavior on such device(s). If you object to such tracking, please promptly contact us via email at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@yello.co\">privacy@yello.co</a>.\n</p><h2 id=\"3\">How do we use Customer Personal Information?</h2><p>\nWe use Customer information in order to administer our Customers\u2019 accounts and allow them to use the Site and Apps. We use Customer information to support and enhance our Customers\u2019 use of the Site and its features and the Apps, including, at times and as an example, tracking emails that our Customers send. We will also use Customer information to fulfill customer requests, such as provide customer service.\n\nWe also use our Customer\u2019s Personal Information for any purpose for which they provide it (for example, if a Customer wishes to share its email address or Personal Information with us for a particular purpose). In addition, we may send our Customers service or promotional communications, including notifying them of new services, offerings, or changes to the Site, Apps, or this Privacy Policy. Our Customers can opt-out of receiving these emails by contacting us at privacy@yello.co.\n\nWe may use Customer information to enable us to display advertisements to third parties\u2019 target audiences. Even though we do not disclose your Personal Information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume you meet its target criteria.\n</p><h2 id=\"4\">How do we use Candidate Personal Information?</h2><p>\nWe use Candidate Personal Information that we obtain directly from Candidates, from third party providers or otherwise with Candidates\u2019 consent to share such Personal Information with our Customers so they can contact Candidates for recruitment and hiring purposes.\n</p><h2 id=\"5\">Do we disclose any Personal Information to outside parties?</h2><p>\nWe do not sell, trade, or transfer your Personal Information to third parties, except in the circumstances described below.\n</p><h3>Our Customers</h3><p>\nAs part of our service offerings, we may disclose to our Customers any Candidates\u2019 Personal Information provided to us, if Candidates consent to such disclosure. By providing Candidates\u2019 Personal Information to our Customers, our Customers will be able to contact such Candidates to inquire about potential future hiring or recruitment opportunities.\n</p><h3>Other Companies</h3><p>\nWe may share de-identified information and reports and analyses based on de-identified information publicly and with other companies.\n</p><h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3><p>\nWe may disclose Personal Information to our vendors and other third-party service providers that help us provide our services.\n\nThe purpose of such disclosure is to provide our services to our Customers, and may include: the sub-processing of such Personal Information between our Site, the Apps, and our and our Customers\u2019 networks; the parsing of such Personal Information to allow our Customers to filter through the information that the Candidates voluntarily provide to our Customers via the Site or Apps; and, generally, allowing our Customers to build a work candidate database based on the information provided by Candidates and manage their recruitment process.\n\nWe may also disclose aggregated, de-identified Personal Information, and analyses and reports derived from such information, to service providers, advertisers, merchants, consumer and market research companies and other organizations. These service providers are responsible for their own compliance with data protection laws.\n</p><h3>To Third Parties for Marketing Purposes</h3><p>\nWe may share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes. This may include third parties whose services we believe you may be interested, or who are interested in providing you with services.\n</p><h3>Legal Requirements and Business Transfers</h3><p>\nWe may disclose Personal Information (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, statute, rule, regulation, or professional standard, or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other government official requests, (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, (iii) in connection with an investigation of a complaint, detect, prevent, or otherwise respond to fraud, security threat or technical concerns, or suspected or actual illegal activity; (iv) in connection with an internal audit; or (v) in the event that Yello is subject to&nbsp; mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, sales of assets, reorganizations, divestitures, dissolutions, bankruptcies, liquidations, or other types of business transactions. In these types of transactions, Personal Information may be shared, sold, or transferred, and it may be used subsequently by a third party.\n</p><h2 id=\"6\">What choices do you have about your Personal Information?</h2><p>\nWe offer certain choices about how we communicate with you and what Personal Information we obtain about you, use, and share with others.\n</p><h3>Profile</h3><p>\nIf you have created a profile or account on our Site or Apps, you can update your contact information after you log into your account.\n</p><h3>E-mail</h3><p>\nIf you no longer wish to receive promotional or informational emails from us, you may opt-out from receiving future emails from us by following the instructions for unsubscribing in the promotional or informational emails we send you or by contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@yello.co\">privacy@yello.co</a>. This opt-out does not apply to information provided to us as a result of product service experience requests.\n</p><h3>Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs)</h3><p>\nTo the extent provided for in applicable data protection laws of Candidates\u2019 countries residence, upon written request from a Candidate, with proper verification of identity at our sole discretion (<i>e.g.&nbsp;</i>via certification from a notary public), we can promptly destroy, correct, amend and/or return, to such verified Candidate, any and all Personal Information in our or our sub-processor\u2019s control or possession, subject to both our right to retain such information as deemed necessary to comply with legal obligations and the obligations detailed in our written agreements with Customers. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such requests within the prescribed period of time set forth in applicable data protection laws.&nbsp; All requests in this regard should be submitted via email to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:privacy@yello.co\">privacy@yello.co</a>.\n\nYello responds to DSARs over email, directly with the Candidate or an authorized representative of the Candidate. We will not log into third party portals or respond to requests within third party applications (including but not limited to: portals, etc).\n\nAdditionally, please note that if you withdraw your consent or object to processing, or if you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, we may be unable to provide some or all of our services to you.\n</p><h3>Contact by our Customers</h3><p>\nAs described above, we will disclose to our Customers Candidates\u2019 Personal Information who provide their consent, which will enable our Customers to contact such Candidates for hiring and recruitment purposes. If a Candidate does not wish to be contacted by our Customers regarding future hiring and recruitment opportunities, they can choose not to provide their consent when prompted by us or by contacting us at privacy@yello.co.\n</p><h3>Your Choices and Controls</h3><p>\nOur Customers or an authorized user of our Customers may access, update, receive, correct, and/or delete registration and other Personal Information by logging into the Site or Apps and modifying their user profile, or by sending us an email at privacy@yello.co. Customers may also close their account at any time by contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@yello.co\">privacy@yello.co</a>. We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement our Customers\u2019 requests promptly, but it may take some time to process.\n\nWhile we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of Personal Information, we reserve the right to erase all or any portion of a Customer or Candidate\u2019s information if we are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested restriction. Please note that in some instances, we may not be able to delete the Personal Information or our Customers or Candidates except by closing such Customer\u2019s user account. We will notify our Customers if we are not able to accommodate their requests or if we have elected to close a Customer account as a result of a failure to accommodate such request.\n</p><h2 id=\"7\">Location of our Site</h2><p>\nOur Site is hosted and operated in the United States. However, we and our service providers may store information about individuals in the United States, or we may transfer it to, and store it within, other countries. In very limited circumstances and at our sole discretion, we may provide certain Customers with the option to elect that their data is hosted in Ireland.\n\nVisitors from jurisdictions outside the United States visit us at their own choice and risk. If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your Personal Information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your Personal Information in the United States or elsewhere. Please note that the level of legal protection provided in the United States from which you may access our Sites may not be as stringent as that under privacy standards or the privacy laws of other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction.\n</p><h2 id=\"8\">How long do we retain your Personal Information?</h2><p>\nWe will keep your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.\n</p><h2 id=\"9\">Third party links</h2><p>\nOccasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our Site or Apps.&nbsp; These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. We urge you to read the privacy policies of other websites before submitting any information to those websites.\n</p><h2 id=\"10\">How do we protect your information?</h2><p>\nWe are committed to protecting the information we receive from our Customers and Candidates. We have implemented commercially reasonable, appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on the Site and on the Apps, including from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, while considering the risks involved; including, but not limited to, severity of foreseeable harm and likelihood that our processing could threaten the individual rights and freedoms of the Candidates. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.\n\nIn addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to Personal Information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access.\n\nAlthough we do our best to protect the Personal Information of our Customers and Candidates, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information transmitted to the Site or Apps. Any transmission of Personal Information is at the Customer\u2019s or Candidate\u2019s own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site or Apps. The safety and security of Personal Information also depends on the Customers and Candidates. Customers and Candidates are responsible for keeping their self-created passwords confidential, and Customers and Candidates must not share passwords with anyone. Customers and Candidates must also take all reasonable steps to ensure the protection of their Personal Information and must be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site or Apps or elsewhere.\n</p><h2 id=\"11\">California residents</h2><p>\nThis Section applies to our collection and use of Personal Information if you are a resident of California, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its implementing regulations, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d).

Through use of the Site and/or Apps, we may also collect Personal Information directly from Yello Customers who provide their Personal Information to Yello for marketing purposes. If our Customers utilize Yello owned devices in connection with the Apps or the Site, we may track such iPads or tablets, and you, as a U.S. based Customer, consent to us tracking such iPads or tablets using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology that is installed and active on such device(s). Such tracking will be utilized for the following purposes: (i) locating device(s) in the event that they are lost or stolen; and/or (ii) locating devices(s) in an anonymized fashion for use on a device heat-map to be used for internal and external marketing purposes and which constitutes a map of broad-scale user activity across the globe.

If you object to such tracking, please promptly contact us via email at privacy@yello.co.\nHow do we use Customer Personal Information?\nWe use Customer information in order to administer our Customers\u2019 accounts and allow them to use the Site and Apps.

Our Customers can opt-out of receiving these emails by contacting us at privacy@yello.co.\n\nWe may use Customer information to enable us to display advertisements to third parties\u2019 target audiences. Even though we do not disclose your Personal Information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume you meet its target criteria.\nHow do we use Candidate Personal Information?\nWe use Candidate Personal Information that we obtain directly from Candidates, from third party providers or otherwise with Candidates\u2019 consent to share such Personal Information with our Customers so they can contact Candidates for recruitment and hiring purposes.\nDo we disclose any Personal Information to outside parties?\nWe do not sell, trade, or transfer your Personal Information to third parties, except in the circumstances described below.\nOur Customers\nAs part of our service offerings, we may disclose to our Customers any Candidates\u2019 Personal Information provided to us, if Candidates consent to such disclosure.

In these types of transactions, Personal Information may be shared, sold, or transferred, and it may be used subsequently by a third party.\nWhat choices do you have about your Personal Information?\nWe offer certain choices about how we communicate with you and what Personal Information we obtain about you, use, and share with others.\nProfile\nIf you have created a profile or account on our Site or Apps, you can update your contact information after you log into your account.\nE-mail\nIf you no longer wish to receive promotional or informational emails from us, you may opt-out from receiving future emails from us by following the instructions for unsubscribing in the promotional or informational emails we send you or by contacting us at privacy@yello.co. This opt-out does not apply to information provided to us as a result of product service experience requests.\nData Subject Access Requests (DSARs)\nTo the extent provided for in applicable data protection laws of Candidates\u2019 countries residence, upon written request from a Candidate, with proper verification of identity at our sole discretion (e.g.\u00a0via certification from a notary public), we can promptly destroy, correct, amend and/or return, to such verified Candidate, any and all Personal Information in our or our sub-processor\u2019s control or possession, subject to both our right to retain such information as deemed necessary to comply with legal obligations and the obligations detailed in our written agreements with Customers. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such requests within the prescribed period of time set forth in applicable data protection laws.\u00a0 All requests in this regard should be submitted via email to\u00a0privacy@yello.co.\n\nYello responds to DSARs over email, directly with the Candidate or an authorized representative of the Candidate. We will not log into third party portals or respond to requests within third party applications (including but not limited to: portals, etc).\n\nAdditionally, please note that if you withdraw your consent or object to processing, or if you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, we may be unable to provide some or all of our services to you.\nContact by our Customers\nAs described above, we will disclose to our Customers Candidates\u2019 Personal Information who provide their consent, which will enable our Customers to contact such Candidates for hiring and recruitment purposes. If a Candidate does not wish to be contacted by our Customers regarding future hiring and recruitment opportunities, they can choose not to provide their consent when prompted by us or by contacting us at privacy@yello.co.\nYour Choices and Controls\nOur Customers or an authorized user of our Customers may access, update, receive, correct, and/or delete registration and other Personal Information by logging into the Site or Apps and modifying their user profile, or by sending us an email at privacy@yello.co. Customers may also close their account at any time by contacting us at privacy@yello.co. We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement our Customers\u2019 requests promptly, but it may take some time to process.\n\nWhile we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of Personal Information, we reserve the right to erase all or any portion of a Customer or Candidate\u2019s information if we are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested restriction. Please note that in some instances, we may not be able to delete the Personal Information or our Customers or Candidates except by closing such Customer\u2019s user account. We will notify our Customers if we are not able to accommodate their requests or if we have elected to close a Customer account as a result of a failure to accommodate such request.\nLocation of our Site\nOur Site is hosted and operated in the United States. However, we and our service providers may store information about individuals in the United States, or we may transfer it to, and store it within, other countries. In very limited circumstances and at our sole discretion, we may provide certain Customers with the option to elect that their data is hosted in Ireland.\n\nVisitors from jurisdictions outside the United States visit us at their own choice and risk. If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your Personal Information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your Personal Information in the United States or elsewhere. Please note that the level of legal protection provided in the United States from which you may access our Sites may not be as stringent as that under privacy standards or the privacy laws of other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction.\nHow long do we retain your Personal Information?\nWe will keep your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.\nThird party links\nOccasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our Site or Apps.\u00a0 These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. We urge you to read the privacy policies of other websites before submitting any information to those websites.\nHow do we protect your information?\nWe are committed to protecting the information we receive from our Customers and Candidates. We have implemented commercially reasonable, appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on the Site and on the Apps, including from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, while considering the risks involved; including, but not limited to, severity of foreseeable harm and likelihood that our processing could threaten the individual rights and freedoms of the Candidates. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.\n\nIn addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to Personal Information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access.\n\nAlthough we do our best to protect the Personal Information of our Customers and Candidates, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information transmitted to the Site or Apps. Any transmission of Personal Information is at the Customer\u2019s or Candidate\u2019s own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site or Apps. The safety and security of Personal Information also depends on the Customers and Candidates. Customers and Candidates are responsible for keeping their self-created passwords confidential, and Customers and Candidates must not share passwords with anyone. Customers and Candidates must also take all reasonable steps to ensure the protection of their Personal Information and must be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site or Apps or elsewhere.\nCalifornia residents\nThis Section applies to our collection and use of Personal Information if you are a resident of California, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its implementing regulations, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d). This Section describes (1) the categories of Personal Information, collected and disclosed by us, (2) your privacy rights, and (3) how to exercise your rights.\n\nIf you would like to receive a copy of this Section in an alternate format (e.g., printable) or language, please contact us using the information provided in the Contact Us section below.\n\nWhen we use the term \u201cPersonal Information\u201d in this section, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\n\nYello makes the following disclosures regarding the categories of Personal Information (enumerated in Section 1798.140(o)(1) of the CCPA) that we have collected within the last 12 months:\nCandidate Personal Data:\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tCategory of Personal Information\n\t\tCollected\n\t\tCategory of Source from which Personal Information is Collected\n\t\tPurpose of Collection\n\t\tThird Parties to whom Personal Information is Disclosed for a Business Purpose\n\t\tThird Parties to whom Personal Information is Sold or Shared\n\t\tRetention Period\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tIdentifiers\n\t\tYes\n\t\tDirectly from you\n\t\tSee section above titled \u201cHow do we use Customer Personal Information?\u201d\n\t\tService Providers\n\t\tWe do not sell or share this category of Personal Information\n\t\t1 year\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tPersonal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal.

You may also have the right to request the categories of Personal Information which were disclosed for business purposes, and the categories of third parties in the twelve (12) months preceding your request for your Personal Information.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tErasure\n\t\tThe right to have your Personal Information deleted. However, please be aware that we may not fulfill your request for deletion if we (or our service provider(s)) are required or permitted to retain your Personal Information for one or more of the following categories of purposes: (1) to complete a transaction for which the Personal Information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or complete a contract between us and you; (2) to ensure our website integrity, security, and functionality; (3) to comply with applicable law or a legal obligation, or exercise rights under the law (including free speech rights); or (4) to otherwise use your Personal Information internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided it.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tCorrection\n\t\tYou have the right to request that we correct any incorrect personal information that we collect or retain about you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see below), we will correct (and direct any of our service providers that hold your data on our behalf to correct) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. We may deny your correction request if (a) we believe the personal information we maintain about you is accurate; (b) correcting the information would be impossible or involve disproportionate; or (c) if the request conflicts with our legal obligations.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAutomated Decision Making\n\t\tYou have the right to request information about the logic involved in automated decision-making and a description of the likely outcome of processes, and the right to opt out. Yello does not currently engage in any automated decision making practices.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tTo Opt Out of Sales or Sharing of Personal Information\n\t\tYou can request to opt out of us selling or sharing your Personal Information. To exercise this right please click here and follow the instructions to submit your request. As noted above, in the past 12 months we may have enabled advertisers to collect certain information, which the advertisers may use to improve their interest-based advertising networks, and this may be considered a \u201csale\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d under the CCPA. Except under these circumstances, Yello does not sell or share your Personal Information.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tLimit Use of Sensitive Personal Information\n\t\tYello does not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information other than for the purpose for which it was originally collected that are reasonably expected by the average consumer. However, if we used or disclosed Sensitive Personal Information for other purposes, you would have the right to opt out.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\nOnly you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your Personal Information.\n\nYou may only make a request for access twice within a 12-month period. The request must:\n\n \tProvide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.\n \tDescribe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it\n\nWe must verify your identity before fulfilling your requests.\u00a0 If we cannot initially verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the verification process. We will only use Personal Information provided in a request to verify the requestor\u2019s identity. If you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of a California consumer, we will also need to verify your identity, which may require proof of your written authorization or evidence of a power of attorney.\n\nWe endeavor to respond to requests within the time period required by applicable law. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\n\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\n\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\n\nWe may deny certain requests, or only fulfill some in part, as permitted or required by law.\u00a0 For example, if you request to delete Personal Information, we may retain Personal Information that we need to retain for legal purposes.\n\nTo exercise your California rights described in this section, please contact us at privacy@yello.com. Yello will not discriminate against you in the event you exercise any of the aforementioned rights under CCPA, including, but not limited to, by:\n\n \tdenying goods or services to you;\n \tcharging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;\n \tproviding a different level or quality of goods or services to you; or\n \tsuggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.\n\nEuropean residents\nGDPR\nIf you are located in the EU, you have certain rights under EU data protection law with respect to your personal data, including the right to request access to, correct, and delete your personal data. You may also have the right to receive a copy of your personal data in a commonly used and machine-readable format, and to transmit such data to another controller. You also may object to processing of your personal data, or ask that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain instances.\n\nUpon written request from a Candidate or Customer, with proper verification of identity at our sole discretion (e.g. via certification from a notary public), we can promptly destroy, correct, amend and/or return to such verified Candidate or Customer any and all Personal Information in our or our sub-processor\u2019s control or possession, subject to our right to retain such information as deemed necessary to comply with legal obligations. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such requests within thirty (30) days of receipt of such request and proper identity verification.\u00a0 All requests in this regard should be submitted via email to privacy@yello.co. Please note that not all requests can be honored.\n\nOur legal basis for processing the personal data of Candidates is that processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, or in order to take steps at the request of the Candidate. Yello processes Candidate personal data in order to fulfill contractual obligations with its Customers, who are Data Controllers, and have instructed Yello, as a data processor, to process the personal data of their Candidates. Our legal basis for processing personal data of Yello Customers is that the Yello Customer(s) has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes including developing new services, management and completion of demo requests, the building of leads as related to product purchases, and/or the provision of thought leadership and blog content to those Yello Customers who are voluntarily subscribed (such subscription is revocable upon written request to marketing@yello.co).\n\nWe have formally appointed a Data Protection Officer, Greg Leighton, reachable via email at , gleighton@polsinelli.com who will, amongst other things: monitor compliance with the GDPR, applicable Union or Member State data protection laws, and our policies related to the protection of personal data; provide advice, where requested and appropriate, regarding data protection impact assessments; reasonably cooperate with applicable supervisory authority; and act as the contact point on issues related to our processing of personal information.\n\nCandidates have the right to submit a GDPR complaint to their local data protection authority.
