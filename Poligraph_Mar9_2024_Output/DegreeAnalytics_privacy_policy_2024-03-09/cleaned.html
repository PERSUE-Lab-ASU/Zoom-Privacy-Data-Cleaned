<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p style="padding-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to any Web sites located through the domains of at degreeanalytics.com, *.degreeanalytics.com (the “Site”) owned and operated by MF Genius, Corp d.b.a Degree Analytics (“MF Genius” “Degree Analytics” “we” or “us”) and the Degree Analytics service accessed through our mobile, web application, or API (the “Service” or “App”) or data, reports or otherwise provided by Degree Analytics. The Degree Analytics Sites and app are owned and operated at 2505 E 6th St Unit B, Austin, TX 78702, United States.</p>
<p>The Policy is designed to tell you how we collect and use personal information (as defined below) so you can make an informed decision about using our Site and the Degree Analytics service. Please read this statement before submitting any personal information to us. By using our Site and service, you represent that you are 14 years old or older and you consent to the information collection and use practices described herein.</p>
<h3>What is personal information?</h3>
<p>As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that identifies an individual, or from which an individual could be identified (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, credit card number or other account number), and information about that individual’s location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Degree Analytics service, when linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or service or categories of Site and service users, from which any personal information has been removed. For example, information that forty-seven percent of the Site’s registered users identify themselves as male, is aggregate information. We collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, including to help us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new publications, products and services, and tailor existing publications, products and services to user desires. This Policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information.</p>
<h3>What personal information do we collect?</h3>
<p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you use the various services and activities available through the Degree Analytics Sites and service. At several places on our Sites, we may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. When you use the App, you have the option to provide us with a name, email, phone number, and profile picture. If you register for the App, send us an email, or submit content, we may collect your name, photo, and/or demographic information that you provide. In addition, from time to time we may collect contact or other personal or demographic information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys.</p>
<p>We will never post to any social network on your behalf or contact anyone on your behalf without your permission. We may provide the option of connecting to the Degree Analytics service through Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or other social network as a faster, easier way for you to create a profile on the Degree Analytics service.</p>
<h3>Using the App</h3>
<p>Degree Analytics app may automatically collect location information from your device. When you use the service, via your mobile device, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">activity on the application and through the service. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Unless you direct us to act otherwise, your personal location information is only stored by Degree Analytics for up to 365 days of inactivity after which location information is disassociated from personal information and anonymized. From this point onward, it is used in the aggregate only. If you no longer wish to allow us to collect and use your location information, you may discontinue the use of the service.</span></p>
<p style="padding: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Software on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the application.</p>
<p>If you wish to discontinue use of the App and would like to have your account permanently deleted, you may send us an email at info@degreeanalytics.com. Once your account is deleted, you will no longer have access to your App history, preferences or any other information associated with your use of the App.</p>
<h3>Tracking Technologies</h3>
<p>When you visit our website or use our mobile apps, Degree Analytics and our service provider partners may collect certain information about your computer or device through technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts. Types of partners that utilize tracking technologies include analytics providers and customer support services. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Sites and Service, providing customer support, understanding product quality and usability, and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
<p>We may also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as those available in the HTML5 web standard to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing LSOs.</p>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>As true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. With exception to users accessing protected data (FERPA and School Record data), we do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. Any time a user access protected data we store an audit trail for security purposes.</p>
<h3>Usage and Disclosure</h3>
<p>In general, we use personal information we may collect (such as your name) to facilitate your use of the Degree Analytics App, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of the Sites, our app, and for any other purpose for which the information was provided. For example, we may use the information we collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints;</li>

<p>In addition, if you so indicate in the event of sharing your contact information with us, we may use the information we collect to send you news and product and service updates, including contacting you about our services, products, activities, special events or offers and for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes, including notifications about new features and or improvements to the Sites of our products and services; We may also receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, and may combine this information with the other personal information we have about you. In such cases, this Policy governs our use and disclosure of such information.

<h3>What personal information do we share with third parties?</h3>
<h4>Student Record Data</h4>
<p>We do not sell, share, or rent any pupil record information to third parties. We do not sell or rent personal, non-personal, or aggregate information to third parties.</p>
<h4>Application User Information</h4>
<p>Degree Analytics may share other personal or non- personal information and aggregate information to third parties in order for the App to provide you some service.

Service Providers include network operations and service monitoring (NOC) providers, server hosting companies, customer support service providers, and analytics services. In addition, we may offer various features through a third party service provider. When you use these services, you would be providing information directly to the provider of these services, and the provision of such information would be subject to such party’s own privacy policy. We are not responsible for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to such third parties with which you come into contact.</p>
<h4>Information from our Website</h4>
<p>Degree Analytics may disclose personal information when we are required to comply with the law (e.g. a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our customers’ rights, property or safety; to protect our customers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Sites; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of personal information.

<h1><strong>Student Records and FERPA</strong></h1>
<p style="padding-bottom: 0;">Degree Analytics may partner with particular educational institutions in an effort to create better student success. School represents and warrants that it will at all times during the Term comply with the Family&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. pt 99, (“FERPA”) and other laws with respect to the Activities, the provision of School Data and its use of the Degree Analytics Platform under this Agreement. To the extent that School discloses to Degree Analytics, or Degree Analytics has access to, education records or personally identifiable information contained in such records (“Education Records”) under this Agreement, Degree Analytics agrees to comply with FERPA, and School agrees to assist Degree Analytics in such compliance, as a “school official” with “legitimate educational interests.” The officers, employees, and agents of Degree Analytics may use such Education Records, but only&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">for</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> the purposes for which the disclosure was made.</span></p>
<h1 style="line-height: 1.6em;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">Student Records and Data Handling</span></h1>
<p>Pupil records obtained by Degree Analytics from LEA continue to be the property of and under the control of the LEA.</p>
<p>Degree Analytics provides a means by which pupils may retain possession and control of user generated content through their account access.</p>
<p>Degree Analytics will not use any information in pupil records for any purpose other than those required or specifically permitted by the contract for the Degree Analytics service.</p>
<p>Parents, legal guardians, or eligible pupils may review personally identifiable information in the pupil’s records and correct erroneous information by contacting the school or educational agency.</p>
<p>Degree Analytics is committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of pupil records. To that end, Degree Analytics has taken the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>limiting employee access to student data based on roles and responsibilities;</li>
<li>conducting background checks on employees who have access to student data;</li>
<li>conducting privacy training that includes FERPA for employees with access to pupil data;</li>
<li>protecting personal information with technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards in order to protect it from unauthorized access, release or use.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of an unauthorized disclosure of a pupil’s records, Degree Analytics will promptly notify the school or educational agency. The notification will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>date of the breach, the types of information that were subject to the breach;</li>
<li>general description of what occurred; steps Degree Analytics is taking to address the breach; 3. the contact person at the vendor who the data holder can contact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Degree Analytics will keep the client fully informed until the incident is resolved.</p>
<p>Degree Analytics will delete personally identifiable data upon request of the LEA and/or upon expiration of the services agreement. Upon termination, cancellation, expiration or other conclusion of the Agreement, Degree Analytics shall return all Private Data to Client, or if return is not feasible as determined by Client in a written notice to Degree Analytics, destroy any and all Private Data. Degree Analytics will keep deidentified and aggregate data for a period of 8 years.</p>
<p>Degree Analytics agrees to work with LEA to ensure compliance with FERPA and the Parties will ensure compliance by providing parents, legal guardians or eligible students with the ability to inspect and review pupil records and to correct any inaccuracies therein as described in the&nbsp;statement above.</p>
<p>Degree Analytics prohibits using personally identifiable information in pupil records to engage in targeted advertising.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 0;">If Degree Analytics is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, including in the case of a bankruptcy, Client will be notified of any change in ownership. In such as case, a successor entity will adhere to the terms of this agreement with regard to the previously collected information.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
