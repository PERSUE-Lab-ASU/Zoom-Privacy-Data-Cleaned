    <li><strong class="numTitle">Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.</strong><br>Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and devices. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through our partners. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the setting on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies</span> <br> When you visit our website or otherwise interact with the Service we (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may send one or more “cookies” to your computer or other devices.

Some cookies may facilitate additional site features for enhanced performance and functionality such as remembering preferences, allowing social interactions, analyzing usage for site optimization, providing custom content, allowing third parties to provide social sharing tools, and serving images or videos from third party websites. Some features on this site will not function if you do not allow cookies. We may link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site. <br> <br> We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interest of our users to enhance the experience of our Services. <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Web Beacons </span><br> We (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may use Web Beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about our Service or other information we or they have collected. Web Beacons are tiny graphic objects that are embedded in a web page or email and are usually invisible to the user but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or email. Web Beacons may be used within the Service to track email open rates, web page visits or form submissions. In some cases, we tie the information gathered by Web Beacons to our users’ personal Information. <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flash and HTML5 Storage </span><br> We use Local Shared Objects, such as Flash cookies, AND/OR Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we may partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your browsing activity also use Flash cookies or HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

These companies may collect information about how you use our Services and other websites over time and across different Services. The information that may be collected could include, among other things, internet protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.<br> <br> We also use Google Analytics which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Service and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.<br><br>We use this information to track and aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movements around the Service and to gather demographic information about our user base in the aggregate. Advertising Networks We may partner with third party data or ad network(s) and other service providers to show you relevant ads, including ads displayed on the Service and on other companies’ websites or apps, on any of your devices. We and our service providers may use cookies and web beacons to deploy and read cookie identifiers and Mobile Ad IDs, associated with your activities on the Service, third party web sites, mobile apps or other information we collect, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

These ad networks and their customers may also use any of this information to measure ad performance, understand their (or our) audience, or otherwise improve and enhance their marketing. <br><br>Similarly, we or a third-party data partner may associate cookies with hashed (non-human readable) versions of your registration data (e.g. your e-mail address), along with other interest-based or demographic data.
