Also, we only collect and use individual’s information where we are legally entitled to do so. Information in relation to Personal Data collected by Irish entities is available on <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.dataprotection.ie</a>, the website of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (“<strong>DPC</strong>”).</p> <p>When you sign up for Nifty, we ask for your first and last name, company name, and email address.

Nifty is a Data Controller (as defined in Data Protection Legislation) in respect of the Your Data. The legal basis upon which we process Your Data is our legitimate interest to provide the Service to you.</p> <p>Your Data is separate from and should be distinguished from User Uploaded Data. “<strong>User Uploaded Data”</strong> is data (which may include Personal Data) uploaded by you or others through Your Account, and may be any information, data or materials provided or utilized by you or others in connection with the Service, including, without limitation, user credentials, and any data contained in your or others’ websites, applications or in tests created by you or a party authorized by you in connection with the Service, and/or any personal data provided by you during a support request, and/or actual tests you run, their text logs, video logs etc. Nifty is a Data Processor (as defined in Data Protection Legislation) in respect of the User Uploaded Data.</p> <p>We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission.</p> <p>If you are aged 18 or under, please get your parent/guardian's permission before you provide Your Data to us.</p> <h4>USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4> <p>We use your information (including any information that we collect, as described in this Privacy Policy) for various purposes depending on the types of information we have collected from and about you and the specific Nifty products you use, including to:</p> <ul><li>Complete a purchase transaction or provide the services you have requested</li> <li>Respond to your request for information and provide you with better customer service</li> <li>Provide you with product updates and information about products you have purchased from us</li> <li>Provide you with notifications via email and push notifications within and through the Nifty product based on your notification selections</li> <li>Analyze and resolve app crashes and other bugs and issues</li></ul> <p>If we wish to use Your Data in any other way, we will ensure that we notify you and get your consent first. You will be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for the use of Your Data for purposes other than those listed in this Privacy Policy.</p> <h4>ANALYTICS &amp; TRACKING</h4> <p>We use third-party analytics services such as Google Analytics and/or MixPanel within our products and services to collect and analyze the information discussed above.<br> If you receive emails from us, we may use certain analytical tools, eg. CampaignMonitor, Intercom etc. to capture data such as when you open our messages or click on any links our email contains.</p> <h4>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4> <p>Nifty will not share Your Data without your consent or unless required by law (except as set out in this Privacy Policy). By the nature of our Service, Nifty will gather statistics about the usage of your website and store that information. Nifty will not share your website statistics without your consent. If Nifty becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some of all of its assets, we will provide notice before Your Data is transferred to any third party.</p> <p>Nifty will share your information in the following ways:</p> <ul><li><strong>Outside Service Providers.</strong> We may provide access to or share your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf. These third parties provide a variety of services to us, including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, provision of content and features, advertising, analytics, research, customer service, data storage, security, fraud prevention, payment processing, and legal services.</li> <li><strong>Google API.</strong> Nifty's use of information received, and Nifty's transfer of information to any other app from Google APIs will adhere to Google's Limited Use Requirements.</li> <li><strong>Third-Party Integrations.</strong> When you initiate a connection with a third-party integration through the Services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, Slack), we will share information about you that is required to enable your use of the third-party integration through the Services.</li> <li><strong>Transfer of Ownership.</strong> Although we don’t intend to sell, in case the ownership of any or all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the Services can continue to operate. If such transfer is subject to additional legal restrictions under applicable laws, Nifty will comply with such restrictions.</li></ul> <h4>THIRD PARTY LINKS AND SERVICES</h4> <p>The Services contain links to third-party websites and may also contain third-party integrations. If you choose to use these sites or integrations, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by Nifty, Nifty is not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your personal and other information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.</p> <h4>DATA DELETION</h4> <p>When you cancel your account, we’ll ensure that nothing is stored on our servers past 30 days. Anything you delete on your account while it’s active will also be purged within 30 days (up until then it may be available in the trash can).</p> <h4>DATA ENCRYPTION</h4> <p>All data is encrypted via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a> when transmitted from our servers to your browser.</p> <h4>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h4> <p>We reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices and the features of our Services.</p> <h4>PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h4> <p>Nifty takes technical and non-technical measures to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. We restrict access to Your Data to employees, contractors and agents who need to know such Your Data in order to operate, develop or improve the services that we provide.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure, and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.</p> <p>Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. To the extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or any other loss or damage resulting from (i) the transfer of data over communications networks and facilities, including the internet, or (ii) any delay or delivery failure on the part of any other service provider not contracted by us, and you acknowledge that the Service may be subject to limitations, delays and other problems inherent in the use of such communications facilities. You will appreciate that we cannot guarantee the absolute prevention of cyber-attacks such as hacking, spyware and viruses. Accordingly, you will not hold us liable for any unauthorized disclosure, loss or destruction of Your Data arising from such risks.</p> <h4>QUESTIONS</h4> <p>Nifty is located at 315 W 36th St, New York, NY 10018.
