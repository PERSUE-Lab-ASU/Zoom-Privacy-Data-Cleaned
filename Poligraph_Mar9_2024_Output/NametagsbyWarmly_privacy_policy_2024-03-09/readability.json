We rely on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and on contractual clauses in our agreements. In particular, we collect and transfer to the United States Personal Information with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of ours in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of \u201cadequacy\u201d from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Given the lack of a finding of \u201cadequacy\u201d, there may be a risk that the supervisory authority and/or data processing principles and/or data subject rights in the United States might not be sufficiently appropriate or comprehensive safeguards from the perspective of the EU. We strive, however, to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information and only to use it consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Notice. Our vendors and others with whom we share your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy are either certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks or we use contractual clauses in our agreements with them that are designed to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information.</p></div></div><div><h2>Additional U.S. State Privacy Disclosures</h2><p data-positional-element-id=\"101\">These Additional U.S. State Privacy Disclosures (the \u201cDisclosures\u201d) supplement the information contained in our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> by providing additional information about our Personal Information processing practices relating to individual residents of the States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah, and Virginia.

we implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, such

However, no security system is impenetrable, and unanticipated system failures or the efforts of malicious actors are an unfortunate reality on the internet. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the information and data within our control, including Personal Information, is absolutely secure.Our Policy Towards ChildrenWarmly does not direct our services towards individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from individuals under the age of 18, we will take reasonable measures to delete such information from our records and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law).

For example, we process your Personal Information when we provide Services to you that you have purchased on our Site.For a Legitimate Interest. We may process your Personal Information where we or a third party have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we have a legitimate interest in understanding how people are using our Services, both to improve them and to market them more effectively. Therefore, we may use your Personal Information to understand and analyze your use of our Services. When we rely on our legitimate interest, we will carry out a balancing test between our legitimate interests and your privacy rights. Our legitimate interests include: understanding how our audience interacts with our content, our marketing and promotions, and our Services; learning about our audience in order to improve our Services for them; developing, delivering, and maintaining relevant and engaging content and promotional information; supporting the dissemination of information on topics of interest to individuals and the community; supporting individuals\u2019 rights to receive information; and conducting our business activities and achieving our business goals.To Comply with Legal Obligations. We will process your Personal Information when necessary to comply with legal and regulatory obligations or defend claims. For example, we may share your Personal Information in response to a court order, subpoena, or law enforcement agency's request.Retention of InformationWe will only keep your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements.To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process it (and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means), and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer Personal Information.Upon expiration of the applicable retention period we will securely destroy your Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.Access, Correction and Deletion of Information We CollectFor Personal Information that we hold about you, you may have the right (subject to exceptions allowed by law) to:- request access to your Personal Information;- request we correct any inaccurate Personal Information;- request we delete any Personal Information;- restrict the processing of Personal Information;- object to the processing of Personal Information; and/or- receive a copy of your Personal Information in a structured and commonly used machine-readable format or have such Personal Information transmitted to another company.We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing information requested to you.\u00a0Modifying Profile and Virtual Business Card Information.

We rely on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and on contractual clauses in our agreements. In particular, we collect and transfer to the United States Personal Information with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of ours in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of \u201cadequacy\u201d from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Given the lack of a finding of \u201cadequacy\u201d, there may be a risk that the supervisory authority and/or data processing principles and/or data subject rights in the United States might not be sufficiently appropriate or comprehensive safeguards from the perspective of the EU. We strive, however, to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information and only to use it consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Notice. Our vendors and others with whom we share your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy are either certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks or we use contractual clauses in our agreements with them that are designed to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information.Additional U.S. State Privacy DisclosuresThese Additional U.S. State Privacy Disclosures (the \u201cDisclosures\u201d) supplement the information contained in our Privacy Policy by providing additional information about our Personal Information processing practices relating to individual residents of the States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah, and Virginia.
