This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on. Additionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our Site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, and timestamps. Personal Information gathered through tracking technologies may include internet or other electronic network activity information for the purposes of cross-device tracking for targeted advertising, the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, links to/from any page, and time spent at a site.<br>‍<br>- <strong>Device data. </strong>We collect data from the device and application you use to access our Services, such as your IP address, operating system version, device type, system and performance information, and browser type.

Like many online services, we and our third-party partners and providers may use cookies to automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit or interact with our email communications and Services. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services. This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. We also use or may use the data collected through cookies to:&nbsp; (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit our Services; (b) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (c) monitor online usage and activities of our Services; (d) diagnose errors and problems with our Services; (e) otherwise plan for and enhance our Services; and (f) facilitate the purposes identified in the “How We Use the Personal Information We Collect” section below.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.&nbsp; Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using our online Services, as some features and services on our online Services may not work properly.&nbsp; Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.&nbsp; In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use.&nbsp; You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.<br><br>- <strong>Web Beacons</strong> (tracking pixels). Web beacons (also known as tracking pixels) are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or open an email and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons used on web pages or in emails allow us to see how successful an article has been, or whether an email message was successfully delivered and read in a marketing campaign. We also use web beacons to learn if you have clicked on any links contained in emails. We may use this information to help us identify which emails are more interesting to you.<br>‍<br>- <strong>Information from third parties. </strong>We may collect your Personal Information or data from third parties if you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us. For example, you have the option of registering and signing into Warmly with a third- party authentication provider. If you do this, the authentication of your logon details is handled by that third-party authenticator.<strong>- Single Sign-On.</strong> We may use single sign-on ("SSO") to allow a user to authenticate their account using one set of login information, including through Google. We will have access to certain information from those third parties in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by those third parties, which may include, for example, your name, username, email address, language preference, and profile picture. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.

The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network.

We may obtain information from other sources, including through publicly available sources, third-party information providers, customers, or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. We may combine this information with other information we collect from or about you. In these cases, our Privacy Policy governs the handling of the combined Personal Information. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages about products and services that may be of interest to you.<br><br>‍- <strong>Analytics Services</strong>.

Therefore, we may use your Personal Information to understand and analyze your use of our Services. When we rely on our legitimate interest, we will carry out a balancing test between our legitimate interests and your privacy rights. Our legitimate interests include: understanding how our audience interacts with our content, our marketing and promotions, and our Services; learning about our audience in order to improve our Services for them; developing, delivering, and maintaining relevant and engaging content and promotional information; supporting the dissemination of information on topics of interest to individuals and the community; supporting individuals’ rights to receive information; and conducting our business activities and achieving our business goals.<br><br>To Comply with Legal Obligations. We will process your Personal Information when necessary to comply with legal and regulatory obligations or defend claims.

The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Given the lack of a finding of “adequacy”, there may be a risk that the supervisory authority and/or data processing principles and/or data subject rights in the United States might not be sufficiently appropriate or comprehensive safeguards from the perspective of the EU.
