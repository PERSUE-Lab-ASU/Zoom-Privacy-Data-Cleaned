                    <p>Information collected automatically is sent to us by your web browser or your internet service
                        provider when you visit our website or attend an event. This information typically includes your
                        domain name, your username, and your numerical IP address. The amount of information sent by
                        your web browser depends on its settings. Please refer to your browser if you want to learn what
                        information it sends. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but you may be able to
                        change your settings so that your browser rejects or removes browser cookies. Disabling cookies
                        for our website may affect the performance, functionality and availability of our website and
                        Services.</p>

                    <p>We use information we collect automatically from website visitors to see which web pages you
                        visit at our website, which website you visited before coming to our website, and where you go
                        after you leave our website, which helps us understand how our visitors use our Services and how
                        we can improve them.</p>

                    <p>As described above, we also automatically collect certain information when you attend an event.
                        Please refer to the above “Audience Information” and “Client Information” sections to learn
                        about the information we automatically collect from clients and audience members who attend
                        events. </p>

                    <h4 class="subheader">Information Sharing and Third Parties </h4>
                    <p>The Call List primarily functions as a Service provider to our clients, who engage us to provide
                        a platform to host events on their behalf. Accordingly, when an audience member registers for or
                        attends an event hosted on The Call List’s platform, we share this information with the client
                        who engaged us to host the event. The event information we share with clients may include
                        recordings of the event, which may encompass audience member audio and video information. This
                        audio and video recording information shared with our clients may constitute “biometric
                        information” under certain laws. You may choose not to provide us with your audio and video
                        information. If you do not consent to our sharing of your audio or video information, do not
                        provide it to us. Similarly, if we offer a contest, survey or a promotion on behalf of the
                        client and you choose to participate, we will share your information with the client we
                        partnered with to offer the contest, survey or promotion. </p>

                    <p>We may also share client and audience member information as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to personal
                            information to carry our Services on our behalf;</li>
                        <li>In response to a request from information if we believe disclosure is advisable or required,
                            including to comply with any law, legal process, or requests by public authorities, law
                            enforcement or third parties;</li>
                        <li>To investigate actions we believe are inconsistent with our agreements or policies, or to
                            protect the rights, property and safety of The Call List, our clients and our audience
                            members;</li>
                        <li>In connection with or during negotiations of any merger, sale, financing or acquisition of
                            all or a portion of our business by another company; and</li>
                        <li>With your consent or at your direction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We also share aggregate and de-identified information that is not personally identifiable with
                        our business partners and other third parties.</p>

                    <p>We do not sell personal data.</p>

                    <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. Please note
                        that these companies may use information about your visit to this website in order to provide
                        advertisements about goods and services that might be of interest to you. In the course of
                        serving advertisements to this website, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie
                        on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices
                        about not having this information used by these companies, please visit

                    <h4 class="subheader">Links to Other Sites </h4>
                    <p>By nature of our service offerings, our website and events contain links to websites, products,
                        and materials not offered, administered, run, or otherwise controlled by The Call List. This
                        Privacy Notice applies only to information collected on The Call List’s website or through The
                        Call List’s platform and not to information collected on linked sites. We encourage you to be
                        aware when you leave this website and to read the privacy statements of each and every linked
                        site that collects your personal information. </p>

                    <h4 class="subheader">Your Choices</h4>
                    <p>If you wish to update, correct or delete information that The Call List maintains about you, you
                        may do so by emailing us at info@thecalllist.com. Please note that we will take steps to verify
                        that the request is valid, including insuring that you are the person making the request. We may
                        also retain certain information that we are required by law to retain, or where we otherwise
                        have a lawful and legitimate business purpose for retaining the information. </p>

                    <p>If you wish to stop receiving promotional communications from us, you may opt-out at any time by
                        unsubscribing through the mechanism provided in the email, or by contacting us at
                        info@thecalllist.com. If you opt-out, you may still receive non-marketing communications from
                        us, such as communications about your account or updates to our Services, policies or terms.</p>

                    <h4 class="subheader">Data Retention</h4>
                    <p>The Call List retains personal information only for as long as necessary to provide our Services.
                        Most event data, including information automatically collected during the event, is aggregated
                        immediately following the event. In the event that personal information is not aggregated, or if
                        event information is recorded, we retain information only for as long as necessary following the
                        event, generally no more than 60 days.</p>



                    <h4 class="subheader">Information Security</h4>
                    <p>We use commercially reasonable physical, technical, organizational, and administrative methods
                        consistent with industry practice to protect your personal information from unauthorized access
                        or disclosure. While we consider these policies and procedures to be adequate, there is still a
                        risk that your personal information could be misappropriated. No method of transmission over the
                        Internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee
                        the absolute security of your personal information. If you have any questions about security on
                        our site, you can send an email to us at the email address specified below. </p>

                    <h4 class="subheader">Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries</h4>
                    <p>The Call List is based in the United States. As such, your information is primarily processed in
                        the United States. If you attend an event, visit our website, or otherwise interact with our
                        Services from outside the United States, your information will be transferred to our servers in
                        the United States and accessible in the United States. By accessing The Call List’s website and
                        registering to use our Services, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the
                        United States. We will endeavor to take steps to ensure that your personal information receives
                        an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it. </p>

                    <h4 class="subheader">European Economic Area Residents </h4>
                    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and
                        protections conferred upon you by Regulation (EU) 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection

                        of transmitting it to another party (data portability). You may also have the right to object to
                        certain processing of your personal data, or request that we restrict processing in certain
                        circumstances. Please note that we will take steps to verify your request, and that we may be
                        entitled to refuse requests where certain exceptions apply. If you would like exercise your
                        rights as a data subject or if you have questions about your rights, please contact us using the
                        contact details provided below. </p>

                    <h4 class="subheader">Children's Information</h4>
                    <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and
                        guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities. We do not direct our
                        websites to children under 16 years of age or knowingly collect information from children for
                        the purpose of selling products or services. If we are made aware that a child under the age of
                        16 years has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to remove that
                        information and to terminate the child’s account.</p>

                    <h4 class="subheader">Changes to this Privacy Notice </h4>
                    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Notice at any time, so please review it frequently.
