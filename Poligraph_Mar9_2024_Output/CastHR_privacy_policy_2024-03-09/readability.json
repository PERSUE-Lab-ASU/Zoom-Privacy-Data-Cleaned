For data transfers from the EU to countries which are not considered to be offering an adequate level of data protection, we and the relevant data exporters and importers have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission.

Data Sharing\nLegal Compliance: In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your Personal Data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b)disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such disclosure is required to protect the security or integrity of our products and services.\n\nService Providers: We may engage selected third-party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own. Such service providers include hosting and server co-location services, communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), data and cyber security services, billing and payment processing services, fraud detection and prevention services, workplace misconduct and harassment reporting services, web analytics, e-mail distribution, marketing and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and enrichment services, social and advertising networks, content providers, e-mail, voicemails, support and customer relation management systems, and our legal, compliance and financial advisors(collectively, \u201cService Providers\u201c).\n\nThese Service Providers may have access to your Personal Data, depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Service, and may only use it for such limited purposes as determined in our agreements with them. When our Service Providers contact you in order to offer or promote our Service, they may additionally interest you in their own services. Should you decide to engage in such activities with CastHR\u2019s Service Providers, please note that such engagement is beyond the scope of CastHR\u2019s Terms and Privacy Policy and will therefore be covered by our Service Provider\u2019s terms and privacy policy.\n\nOur Service Providers shall be deemed as \u2018Data Processors\u2019 in circumstances where CastHR assumes the role of \u2018Data Controller\u2019; and where CastHR acts as the Data Processor for our customer, the Service Provider shall be deemed our \u2018Sub-Processor\u2019 (as further described in Section \u200e9 below). A list of our current Subprocessors may be found here.\n\nSharing Personal Data with our customers, their Users and service providers: We may share your Personal Data with the customer owning the account to which you are subscribed as a User (including data and communications concerning your User Profile). In such cases, sharing such data means that the account\u2019s Admin(s) may access it on behalf of the customer, and will be able to monitor, process and analyze your Personal Data.\n\nYour public User Profile will also be made available to other Users on the same account. If your organization adds any of its service providers to the Service, for example any pension fund, investment or financial advisors, then such service providers may also have access to your User Profile, and possibly to your User Data as well (depending on the privileges you or your organization grant them).\n\nAny Personal Data you submit to areas in the Service marked as \u201cprivate\u201d may still be accessed, copied and processed by your organization\u2019s Admin(s). Please note that CastHR is not responsible for and does not control any further disclosure, use or monitoring by or on behalf of the customer, that itself acts as the \u201cData Controller\u201d of such data (as further described in Section \u200e9 below).\n\nSharing your Feedback or Recommendations: If you submit a public review or feedback, note that we may (at our discretion) store and present your review to other users of our Sites and Service (including other customers). If you wish to remove your public review, please contact us at support@casthr.co.

Your name and e-mail address may be included in the invitation e-mail or message.\n\nProtecting Rights and Safety: We may share your Personal Data with others if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of CastHR, any of our Users or customers, or any members of the general public.\n\nCastHR Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies: We may share Personal Data internally within our group, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, should CastHR or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates undergo any change in control or ownership, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of any of its assets, your Personal Data may be shared with the parties involved in such an event. If we believe that such change in control might materially affect your Personal Data then stored with us, we will notify you of this event and the choices you may have via e-mail or prominent notice on our Service.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, CastHR may share your Personal Data in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal and anonymous. We may transfer, share or otherwise use non-personal data at our sole discretion and without the need for further approval.\n\n5.   Cookies and Tracking Technologies\nOur Sites and Service (including some of our Service Providers) utilize \u201ccookies\u201d, anonymous identifiers, pixels, container tags and other technologies in order for us to provide our Service and ensure that it performs properly, to analyze our performance and marketing activities, and to personalize your experience.

We may provide such notices through any of the contact means available to us (e.g. phone, mobile or e-mail), through the Service, or through our marketing campaigns on any other sites or platforms.\n\nIf you do not wish to receive such promotional communications, you may notify CastHR at any time by sending an e-mail to support@casthr.co, changing your communications preferences in your User Profile settings, or by following the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d, \u201cstop\u201d, \u201copt-out\u201d or \u201cchange e-mail preferences\u201d instructions contained in the promotional communications you receive.\n\n7.   Data Security\nIn order to protect your Personal Data held with us, we are using industry-standard physical, procedural and technical security measures, including encryption as appropriate. However, please be aware that regardless of any security measures used, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of any Personal Data stored with us or with any third parties as described in Section 4 above. To learn more, please visit https://casthr.co/legal/security/ .\n\n8.   Data Subject Rights\nIf you wish to exercise your rights under any applicable law, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) such as the right to request access to, and rectification or erasure of your Personal Data held with CastHR, or to restrict or object to such Personal Data\u2019s processing, or to port such Personal Data, or the right to equal services and prices (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you) \u2013 please contact us by e-mail at support@casthr.co.\n\nPlease note that once you contact us by e-mail, we may instruct you on how to fulfill your request independently through your User Profile settings; or may require additional information and documents, including certain Personal Data, in order to authenticate and validate your identity and to process your request. Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g. as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 3 above.\n\nIf you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data we process on your organization\u2019s (our customer\u2019s) behalf, please contact your organization\u2019s Admin directly (as your organization is the \u201cData Controller\u201d of such data \u2013 see Section \u200e9).\n\n9.   Data Controller/Processor\nCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201cData Controller\u201d, who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cData Processor\u201d, who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. Below we explain how these roles apply to our Service, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.\n\nCastHR is the \u201cData Controller\u201d of Personal Data relating to its Visitors\u2019, Admins\u2019 and other business contacts at our customers, as well as of User Data consisting of profile and contact details, and usage, preferences, engagement and analytics data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cData Processor\u201d.\n\nIf any of our Users upload or submit to the Service Personal Data which relates to other individuals (e.g., by submitting their family members\u2019 details), such data will only be processed by CastHR on behalf of our customer, which is the owner of the respective account, along with all other User Data processed on such customer\u2019s behalf.\n\nIn such instances, our customer shall be deemed the \u201cData Controller\u201d of such data, and CastHR will process such data on the customer\u2019s behalf, as its \u201cData Processor\u201d, in accordance with its reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms, our Data Processing Agreement with such customer (to the extent applicable) and other commercial agreements. CastHR\u2019s Service Providers shall act as designated Sub-Processors in these instances. CastHR\u2019s customer will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).\n\nIf you would like to make any requests or queries regarding personal data we process as a Data Processor on our Customer\u2019s behalf, including accessing, correcting or deleting your data, please contact your Admin directly.\n\n10. Additional Notices\nUpdates and Amendments: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version on our Service. The amended version will be effective as of the date it is published. When we make material changes to these Terms, we\u2019ll provide customer with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending customer an email. Your continued use of the Service after the changes have been implemented will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\n\nExternal Links: While our Service may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to pay attention when you leave our Service for the website or application of such third parties, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website and service you visit. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Service.\n\nOur Service is not designed to attract children under the age of 16: We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children and do not wish to do so. If we learn that a person under the age of 16 is using the Service, we will attempt to prohibit and block such use and will make our best efforts to promptly delete any Personal Data stored with us with regard to such child. If you believe that we might have any such data, please contact us by e-mail at support@casthr.co.\n\n\n                </pre>\n\n            </div>\n\n    <!-- Section 7 -->\n\n        </div></div>", "textContent": "\n            \n\n    \n                This Privacy Policy describes how we \u2013 CastHR Limited (together with its affiliates companies \u2013 \u201cCastHR\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) collect, store, use and disclose personal data regarding individuals (\u201cyou\u201d) who: (i) visit or otherwise interact with our websites (\u201cVisitors\u201d), available at www.casthr.co or any other website, webpage, e-mail, text message or online ad under our control (collectively \u2013 \u201cSites\u201d); (ii) use our cloud-based human resources management platform, via the Sites or mobile applications and any additional extensions whether as an end user (\u201cusers\u201d) or as an administrator (\u201cAdmin\u201d) on behalf of our business customers (\u201ccustomers\u201d; and together with the Sites \u2013 the \u201cService\u201d).\n\nYour privacy is important to us, and we are strongly committed to making our practices regarding your personal data transparent and fair.\n\nPlease read this Privacy Policy carefully and make sure that you fully understand and agree to it.\n\nYou are not legally required to provide us with any Personal Data (defined below), and may do so (or avoid doing so) at your own free will.\n\nIf you do not wish to provide us with such Personal Data, or to have it processed by us or any of our Service Providers (defined below), please simply do not enter our Sites or use our Service.

We may also retain your Personal Data in other locations as reasonably necessary for the proper performance and delivery of our Service, or as may be required by law.\n\nWhile privacy laws may vary between jurisdictions, CastHR and its affiliates and Service Providers are each committed to protect Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and customary industry standards, and such appropriate lawful mechanisms and contractual terms requiring adequate data protection, regardless of any lesser legal requirements that may apply in their jurisdiction. For data transfers from the EU to countries which are not considered to be offering an adequate level of data protection, we and the relevant data exporters and importers have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission.

Data Sharing\nLegal Compliance: In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your Personal Data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b)disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such disclosure is required to protect the security or integrity of our products and services.\n\nService Providers: We may engage selected third-party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own. Such service providers include hosting and server co-location services, communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), data and cyber security services, billing and payment processing services, fraud detection and prevention services, workplace misconduct and harassment reporting services, web analytics, e-mail distribution, marketing and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and enrichment services, social and advertising networks, content providers, e-mail, voicemails, support and customer relation management systems, and our legal, compliance and financial advisors(collectively, \u201cService Providers\u201c).\n\nThese Service Providers may have access to your Personal Data, depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Service, and may only use it for such limited purposes as determined in our agreements with them. When our Service Providers contact you in order to offer or promote our Service, they may additionally interest you in their own services. Should you decide to engage in such activities with CastHR\u2019s Service Providers, please note that such engagement is beyond the scope of CastHR\u2019s Terms and Privacy Policy and will therefore be covered by our Service Provider\u2019s terms and privacy policy.\n\nOur Service Providers shall be deemed as \u2018Data Processors\u2019 in circumstances where CastHR assumes the role of \u2018Data Controller\u2019; and where CastHR acts as the Data Processor for our customer, the Service Provider shall be deemed our \u2018Sub-Processor\u2019 (as further described in Section \u200e9 below). A list of our current Subprocessors may be found here.\n\nSharing Personal Data with our customers, their Users and service providers: We may share your Personal Data with the customer owning the account to which you are subscribed as a User (including data and communications concerning your User Profile). In such cases, sharing such data means that the account\u2019s Admin(s) may access it on behalf of the customer, and will be able to monitor, process and analyze your Personal Data.\n\nYour public User Profile will also be made available to other Users on the same account. If your organization adds any of its service providers to the Service, for example any pension fund, investment or financial advisors, then such service providers may also have access to your User Profile, and possibly to your User Data as well (depending on the privileges you or your organization grant them).\n\nAny Personal Data you submit to areas in the Service marked as \u201cprivate\u201d may still be accessed, copied and processed by your organization\u2019s Admin(s). Please note that CastHR is not responsible for and does not control any further disclosure, use or monitoring by or on behalf of the customer, that itself acts as the \u201cData Controller\u201d of such data (as further described in Section \u200e9 below).\n\nSharing your Feedback or Recommendations: If you submit a public review or feedback, note that we may (at our discretion) store and present your review to other users of our Sites and Service (including other customers). If you wish to remove your public review, please contact us at support@casthr.co. If you choose to send others an e-mail or message inviting them to use the Service, we will use the contact information you provide us to automatically send such invitation e-mail or message on your behalf. Your name and e-mail address may be included in the invitation e-mail or message.\n\nProtecting Rights and Safety: We may share your Personal Data with others if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of CastHR, any of our Users or customers, or any members of the general public.\n\nCastHR Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies: We may share Personal Data internally within our group, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, should CastHR or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates undergo any change in control or ownership, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of any of its assets, your Personal Data may be shared with the parties involved in such an event. If we believe that such change in control might materially affect your Personal Data then stored with us, we will notify you of this event and the choices you may have via e-mail or prominent notice on our Service.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, CastHR may share your Personal Data in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal and anonymous. We may transfer, share or otherwise use non-personal data at our sole discretion and without the need for further approval.\n\n5.   Cookies and Tracking Technologies\nOur Sites and Service (including some of our Service Providers) utilize \u201ccookies\u201d, anonymous identifiers, pixels, container tags and other technologies in order for us to provide our Service and ensure that it performs properly, to analyze our performance and marketing activities, and to personalize your experience. For more information, Such cookies and similar files or tags may also be temporarily placed on your device.

Communications\nService Communications: We may contact you with important information regarding our Service. For example, we may send you notifications (through any of the means available to us) of changes or updates to our Service, billing issues, service changes, log-in attempts or password reset notices, etc. Our customers, and other Users on the same account, may also send you notifications, messages and other updates regarding their or your use of the Service. You can control your communications and notifications settings from your User Profile settings. However, please note that you will not be able to opt-out of receiving certain service communications which are integral to your use (like password resets or billing notices).\n\nPromotional Communications: We may also notify you about new features, additional offerings, events and special opportunities or any other information we think our Users will find valuable. We may provide such notices through any of the contact means available to us (e.g. phone, mobile or e-mail), through the Service, or through our marketing campaigns on any other sites or platforms.\n\nIf you do not wish to receive such promotional communications, you may notify CastHR at any time by sending an e-mail to support@casthr.co, changing your communications preferences in your User Profile settings, or by following the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d, \u201cstop\u201d, \u201copt-out\u201d or \u201cchange e-mail preferences\u201d instructions contained in the promotional communications you receive.\n\n7.   Data Security\nIn order to protect your Personal Data held with us, we are using industry-standard physical, procedural and technical security measures, including encryption as appropriate. However, please be aware that regardless of any security measures used, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of any Personal Data stored with us or with any third parties as described in Section 4 above. To learn more, please visit https://casthr.co/legal/security/ .\n\n8.   Data Subject Rights\nIf you wish to exercise your rights under any applicable law, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) such as the right to request access to, and rectification or erasure of your Personal Data held with CastHR, or to restrict or object to such Personal Data\u2019s processing, or to port such Personal Data, or the right to equal services and prices (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you) \u2013 please contact us by e-mail at support@casthr.co.\n\nPlease note that once you contact us by e-mail, we may instruct you on how to fulfill your request independently through your User Profile settings; or may require additional information and documents, including certain Personal Data, in order to authenticate and validate your identity and to process your request. Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g. as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 3 above.\n\nIf you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data we process on your organization\u2019s (our customer\u2019s) behalf, please contact your organization\u2019s Admin directly (as your organization is the \u201cData Controller\u201d of such data \u2013 see Section \u200e9).\n\n9.   Data Controller/Processor\nCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201cData Controller\u201d, who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cData Processor\u201d, who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. Below we explain how these roles apply to our Service, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.\n\nCastHR is the \u201cData Controller\u201d of Personal Data relating to its Visitors\u2019, Admins\u2019 and other business contacts at our customers, as well as of User Data consisting of profile and contact details, and usage, preferences, engagement and analytics data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cData Processor\u201d.\n\nIf any of our Users upload or submit to the Service Personal Data which relates to other individuals (e.g., by submitting their family members\u2019 details), such data will only be processed by CastHR on behalf of our customer, which is the owner of the respective account, along with all other User Data processed on such customer\u2019s behalf.\n\nIn such instances, our customer shall be deemed the \u201cData Controller\u201d of such data, and CastHR will process such data on the customer\u2019s behalf, as its \u201cData Processor\u201d, in accordance with its reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms, our Data Processing Agreement with such customer (to the extent applicable) and other commercial agreements. CastHR\u2019s Service Providers shall act as designated Sub-Processors in these instances. CastHR\u2019s customer will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).\n\nIf you would like to make any requests or queries regarding personal data we process as a Data Processor on our Customer\u2019s behalf, including accessing, correcting or deleting your data, please contact your Admin directly.\n\n10. Additional Notices\nUpdates and Amendments: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version on our Service. The amended version will be effective as of the date it is published. When we make material changes to these Terms, we\u2019ll provide customer with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending customer an email. Your continued use of the Service after the changes have been implemented will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\n\nExternal Links: While our Service may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to pay attention when you leave our Service for the website or application of such third parties, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website and service you visit. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Service.\n\nOur Service is not designed to attract children under the age of 16: We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children and do not wish to do so. If we learn that a person under the age of 16 is using the Service, we will attempt to prohibit and block such use and will make our best efforts to promptly delete any Personal Data stored with us with regard to such child. If you believe that we might have any such data, please contact us by e-mail at support@casthr.co.\n\n\n                \n\n            \n\n    \n\n        ", "length": 26833, "excerpt": "Cast HR platform provides HR solutions for onboarding, recruiting, leave tracking, performance review.
