When you delete data, we follow a deletion policy to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form.</p>\n                        <h3>Information retained until you remove it</h3>\n                        <p>We offer a range of services that allow you to correct or delete data stored in your bluecap app. For example, you can:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                                <li>Edit your personal and organization information</li>\n                                <li>Edit or delete activities such as recent searches and results, contents like calendar events, meetings transcripts, summaries, notes, contacts, etc.</li>\n                                <li>Delete your bluecap account entirely including all data generated from the use of the application (unless specified otherwise for certain business cases and compliance purposes such as healthcare data).</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        \n                        <h3>Data that expires after a specific period of time</h3>\n                        <p>In some cases, rather than provide a way to delete data, we store it for a predetermined period of time. For each type of data, we set retention timeframes based on the reason for its collection. For example, to ensure that our services display properly on many different types of devices, we may retain browser width and height for up to 9 months. We also take steps to anonymize certain data within set time periods. For example, we anonymize advertising data in server logs by removing part of the IP address after 9 months and cookie information after 18 months.</p>\n                        <h3>Information retained until your bluecap Account is deleted</h3>\n                        <p>We keep some data for the life of your Google Account if it\u2019s useful for helping us understand how users interact with our features and how we can improve our services. For example, after you delete a specific search from search activities, we might keep information about how often you search for things, but not what you searched for. When you delete your bluecap Account, the information about how often you search for things is also removed.</p>\n                        <h3>Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes</h3>\n                        <p>Sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. For example, when bluecap processes a payment for you, or when you make a payment to bluecap, we\u2019ll retain this data for longer periods of time as required for tax or accounting purposes. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                                <li>Security, fraud &amp; abuse prevention</li>\n                                <li>Financial record-keeping</li>\n                                <li>\n                                    Complying with legal or regulatory requirements\n                                    <ul>\n                                        <li>Customers require additional compliance such as HIPAA.</li>\n                                    </ul>\n                                </li>\n                                <li>Ensuring the continuity of our services</li>\n                                <li>Direct communications with bluecap</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        \n                        <h2>Deleting Data</h2>\n                        <p>Data you put into our system is yours. Users have options to delete accounts and all account-related data. Users can send requests to <a href=\"mailto:delete@bluecap.ai\">delete@bluecap.ai</a>. Once deleted, the account and information can no longer be recovered.</p>\n                        <p>Upon receiving the request, we immediately start the process of removing it from the product and our systems. We then begin a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from our storage systems. Safe deletion is important to protect our users and customers from accidental data loss. Complete deletion of data from our servers is equally important for users\u2019 peace of mind. This process generally takes around 3 months from the time of deletion. This often includes up to a month-long recovery period in case the data was removed unintentionally. Each bluecap storage system from which data gets deleted has its own detailed process for safe and complete deletion. This might involve repeated passes through the system to confirm all data has been deleted, or brief delays to allow for recovery from mistakes. As a result, deletion could sometimes take longer when extra time is needed to safely and completely delete the data. Our services also use encrypted backup storage as another layer of protection to help recover from potential disasters. Data can remain on these systems for up to 8 months. As with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and timeframes defined in this article. We maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div>\n                        <h2>HIPAA (PIPEDA for Canada) Compliance</h2>\n                        <p>It is important to note that there is no certification recognized for HIPAA compliance and that complying with HIPAA is a shared responsibility between the customer, bluecap and bluecap\u2019s cloud infrastructure providers.

We ensure the user that the use of their Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams is limited to the way disclosed to the user.\n                        Personally identifiable and sensitive information is managed with additional enhanced security using DLP, De-Identification processes including BAA with all third party vendors and customers where applicable. All Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. However, no means of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and while we endeavor to use commercially reasonable means to protect personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. bluecap\u2122 offers additional security with MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and SSO (Single Sign On) with third-part applications and CRMs such as Google Workspace and Microsoft Office 365.\n                        All information pertaining to credit cards is processed by Stripe. Absolutely no information pertaining to your credit cards will be saved in our database.\n                        We manage compliance requirements at the HIPAA, GDPR, and PIPEDA security levels.\n                    \n\n                    \n                        Data Retention Policy\n                        Some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary. When you delete data, we follow a deletion policy to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form.\n                        Information retained until you remove it\n                        We offer a range of services that allow you to correct or delete data stored in your bluecap app. For example, you can:\n                        \n                                Edit your personal and organization information\n                                Edit or delete activities such as recent searches and results, contents like calendar events, meetings transcripts, summaries, notes, contacts, etc.\n                                Delete your bluecap account entirely including all data generated from the use of the application (unless specified otherwise for certain business cases and compliance purposes such as healthcare data).\n                            \n                        \n                        Data that expires after a specific period of time\n                        In some cases, rather than provide a way to delete data, we store it for a predetermined period of time. For each type of data, we set retention timeframes based on the reason for its collection. For example, to ensure that our services display properly on many different types of devices, we may retain browser width and height for up to 9 months. We also take steps to anonymize certain data within set time periods. For example, we anonymize advertising data in server logs by removing part of the IP address after 9 months and cookie information after 18 months.\n                        Information retained until your bluecap Account is deleted\n                        We keep some data for the life of your Google Account if it\u2019s useful for helping us understand how users interact with our features and how we can improve our services. For example, after you delete a specific search from search activities, we might keep information about how often you search for things, but not what you searched for. When you delete your bluecap Account, the information about how often you search for things is also removed.\n                        Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes\n                        Sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. For example, when bluecap processes a payment for you, or when you make a payment to bluecap, we\u2019ll retain this data for longer periods of time as required for tax or accounting purposes. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include:\n                        \n                                Security, fraud & abuse prevention\n                                Financial record-keeping\n                                \n                                    Complying with legal or regulatory requirements\n                                    \n                                        Customers require additional compliance such as HIPAA.\n                                    \n                                \n                                Ensuring the continuity of our services\n                                Direct communications with bluecap\n                            \n                        \n                        Deleting Data\n                        Data you put into our system is yours. Users have options to delete accounts and all account-related data. Users can send requests to delete@bluecap.ai. Once deleted, the account and information can no longer be recovered.\n                        Upon receiving the request, we immediately start the process of removing it from the product and our systems. We then begin a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from our storage systems. Safe deletion is important to protect our users and customers from accidental data loss. Complete deletion of data from our servers is equally important for users\u2019 peace of mind. This process generally takes around 3 months from the time of deletion. This often includes up to a month-long recovery period in case the data was removed unintentionally. Each bluecap storage system from which data gets deleted has its own detailed process for safe and complete deletion. This might involve repeated passes through the system to confirm all data has been deleted, or brief delays to allow for recovery from mistakes. As a result, deletion could sometimes take longer when extra time is needed to safely and completely delete the data. Our services also use encrypted backup storage as another layer of protection to help recover from potential disasters. Data can remain on these systems for up to 8 months. As with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and timeframes defined in this article. We maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.\n                    \n\n                    \n                        HIPAA (PIPEDA for Canada) Compliance\n                        It is important to note that there is no certification recognized for HIPAA compliance and that complying with HIPAA is a shared responsibility between the customer, bluecap and bluecap\u2019s cloud infrastructure providers. Bluecap takes all the required measures set by GCP\u2019s recommendations and has entered with all necessary and required BAA with its cloud vendors. Customers that are subject to HIPAA must review and accept bluecap's Business Associate Agreement (BAA). bluecap ensures that the cloud products covered under the BAA meet the requirements under HIPAA and align with our ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, and 27018 certifications and SOC 2 report.\n                    \n\n                    \n                        Information Breach Notification\n                        bluecap will immediately notify you and the required parties including authorities following a breach of unsecured protected health information.
