<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Protecting privacy has three forms at CU Ballot. First is the process that we have developed for secure e-voting. Second, is how we handle sensitive voter information that we have been entrusted with to make the elections authenticated and verifiable. And third, is how we handle customer information.</p>
<h2>Customer Supplied Voter Information</h2>
<p>To make your election successful and secure, you trust CU Ballot with certain information. The company maintains strict information privacy policies and uses state of the art technologies to safeguard voter information from unauthorized intrusions.</p>
<p>The key to secure e-voting is to authenticate the voter and this can be handled in three ways, (1) something they know (e.g., Date of birth, Member Number, etc.), (2) something they are given (e.g., a Voter Encrypted Registration Number), or (3) something they are (e.g., biometric). The first two methods are used on CU Ballot. Depending on the type of election, we will be supplied with a registered voter list and corresponding unique voter information. The following section states our policy regarding this supplied voter information.</p>
<p><strong>Our Use of Your Voter Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We internally use your voter information to authenticate voters in a given election.</li>
<li>This information may also be used during the setup of an election for testing purposes.</li>
<li>This information will be purged from our system once an election is complete and our obligation to you as a customer has been fulfilled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Disclosure of Your Voter Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We do not sell or rent any voter information to any third party. All voter information is used solely for the purposes of the election.</li>
<li>General statistics about voter information such as total numbers of voters in a given election will be used and disclosed for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, none of the actual supplied voter information will be released or archived in any form.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security of Your Voter Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CU Ballot has implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your voter information from unauthorized access or improper use, and we will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available.</li>
</ul>
