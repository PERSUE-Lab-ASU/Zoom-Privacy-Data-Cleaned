As of July 16, 2020, Achievers\n    will primarily rely on country-level adequacy decisions or the Standard\n    Contractual Clauses for EU, UK, and Swiss transfers.

If you are a Member of the Achievers Platform, any data collected\n    and processed is governed by our agreement with your employer and the\n    Achievers Platform Privacy Notice.\n  \n\n  \n    You should read and understand this Privacy Notice because it constitutes\n    the core of our obligations to you when you use this website and when you\n    provide your Personal Information to us, either directly or through\n    automated processes.

For example, we\n    will not be able to delete your personal information if we are required by\n    law to keep it or if we hold it in connection with a contract with you.\n    Similarly, access to your personal information may be refused if making the\n    information available would reveal personal information about another person\n    or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information.\n  \n\n  \n    Achievers will only refuse access to your Personal Information in those\n    circumstances permitted and required by applicable laws or regulations. If\n    we cannot fulfill your request, we will inform you about why we cannot\n    comply with your request.\n  \n\n  WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT\n\n  \n    Where we process your personal information based on your consent, you have\n    the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the\n    lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Applicable\n    law may also give you the right to object to certain elements of our\n    processing or to lodge a complaint.\n  \n\n  Object to Processing\n  \n    You have the right to object to processing (including profiling) based on\n    legitimate interest grounds, where we are relying upon legitimate interests\n    to process personal information. If you object, we must stop that processing\n    unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing\n    that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need to process the\n    personal information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal\n    claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing, we\n    believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we\n    will consider each case on an individual basis.\n  \n\n  Object to Marketing\n  \n    You have the right to object to our use of your personal information\n    (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use\n    your personal information to invite you to our promotional events.\n  \n\n  Right to Lodge a Complaint\n  \n    You have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority, if\n    you consider that the processing of your personal information infringes\n    applicable law.\n  \n\n  ENFORCEMENT\n\n  \n    Achievers will conduct periodic assessments to validate its continued\n    adherence to this Notice.\n  \n\n  \n    Where Achievers has knowledge that one of Achievers employees or Service\n    Providers is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary\n    to this Notice, Achievers will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the\n    use or disclosure. Achievers holds its employees and Service Providers\n    accountable for maintaining the trust that employers and users place in our\n    company.\n  \n\n  INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER\n\n  \n    The personal information we collect from you may be transferred to, stored\n    at or processed in other countries, including the United States or other\n    locations outside the European Economic Area, which may not provide\n    equivalent levels of data protection to your home jurisdiction.\n  \n\n  \n    We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an\n    adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it,\n    including through appropriate written data processing terms and/or data\n    transfer agreements. For transfers from the EU, United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) or\n    Switzerland to the US, Achievers relies on adequacy decisions by the EU\n    Commission or putting in place standard contractual clauses as approved by\n    the European Commission (the form for the standard contractual clauses can\n    be found here:\n    EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses)\n    or another applicable supervisory body.\n  \n\n  PRIVACY SHIELD\n\n  \n    Achievers, through its US affiliate Achievers LLC, complies with the EU-US\n    Privacy Shield Framework (\u201cEU Privacy Shield\u201d) and the Swiss-US Privacy\n    Shield Framework (\u201cSwiss Privacy Shield\u201d) as set forth by the US Department\n    of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal\n    information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d)\n    and Switzerland to the United States.\n  \n\n  \n    As part of the certification made via its prior affiliate, Blackhawk Network\n    Inc., Achievers has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres\n    to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information.

In addition to\n    Privacy Shield, Achievers also executed Standard Contractual Clauses with\n    entities involved in such data transfers. As of July 16, 2020, Achievers\n    will primarily rely on country-level adequacy decisions or the Standard\n    Contractual Clauses for EU, UK, and Swiss transfers. For transfers occurring\n    prior to July 16, 2020, Achievers will continue to be responsible for the\n    processing of EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Information under the EU Privacy\n    Shield Framework and will maintain full compliance with the requirements of\n    that framework until further notice. Subsequent transfers of EU, UK, and\n    Swiss Personal Information to any third-party acting as an agent on our\n    behalf occurring after July 16, 2020, will be under the terms of the EU\n    Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses.\n  \n\n  \n    With respect to Personal Information received or transferred pursuant to the\n    EU or Swiss Privacy Shield Framework, Achievers is and will continue to be\n    subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade\n    Commission until further notice.\n  \n\n  \n    In certain situations, Achievers may be required to disclose Personal\n    Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including\n    to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. To the best of\n    our knowledge, Achievers\u2019 systems are not subject to routine access by\n    government authorities without warrants or appropriate accountability via\n    established legal process.\n  \n\n  \n    Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website\n    \n      https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution\n    procedures have been exhausted.\n  \n\n  DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n  \n    Achievers will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes\n    regarding the use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with\n    the principles contained in this Notice.\n  \n\n  \n    Under certain conditions, more fully described on the\n    Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution\n    procedures have been exhausted.\n  \n\n  CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE\n\n  \n    This Notice is subject to change, so if this is your first time reading it,\n    please make sure it is not the last.
