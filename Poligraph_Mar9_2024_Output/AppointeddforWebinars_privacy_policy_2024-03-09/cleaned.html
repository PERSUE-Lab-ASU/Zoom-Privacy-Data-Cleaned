<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headings are included in this Policy for convenience only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does this policy cover?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy applies only to your use of our Site and our related product. Our site may contain links to other websites. Please note that we have no control over how your data is collected, stored, or used by other websites and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing any data to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is personal data</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal data is defined in the UK GDPR and the EU GDPR (later referred to as the “GDPR”, unless specified) as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier”.&nbsp; The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) also known as AAB-375, defines “Personal information” as “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household”.&nbsp; When referring to Personal data in this policy we are referencing both definitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your rights?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to be informed about our collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Policy (and our accompanying </span><a href="https://www.appointedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ISMS-Data-Protection-Policy-external.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protection</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to ask any questions using privacy@appointedd.com.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Please see the section entitled “How Can You Access Your Personal Data” below.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to have your personal data rectified if any of your personal data held by us is inaccurate or incomplete. Please contact us using the details provided in the About Us section above.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your personal data that we have. Please contact us using the details provided in the About Us section above to find out more.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to object to our using of your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly, we are using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under CCPA, you have the following rights, which we will uphold:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to opt out.&nbsp; Please note Appointedd does not sell any personal information to third parties.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to notice.&nbsp; Please see the “Cookies” section of this policy, and note you will have been informed of our use of cookies upon your first visit to our website.&nbsp; You will have been informed of our Privacy Policy ahead of signing up for our software.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right disclosure.&nbsp; Please see the sections entitled “How Can You Access Your Personal Data” and “Data Portability”.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to deletion.&nbsp; Please see the section entitled “Data Portability”.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to equal services and prices.&nbsp; Please see the section entitled&nbsp; “Using Your Data”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information about our use of your personal data or exercising your rights as outlined above, please contact us using the details provided in the About Us section above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further information about your rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office or your local Citizens Advice Bureau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting your data</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company shall endeavour at all times to comply with GDPR, CCPA and all applicable data protection &amp; privacy legislation. The Company will only process personal data in accordance with the applicable rules and this privacy policy.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you require further information on your rights under the Data Protection Act please contact the Information Commissioner. Further details can be found by visiting https://ico.org.uk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using your data</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the GDPR, we must always have a lawful basis for using personal data. This may be because the data is necessary for our performance of a contract with you or because you have consented to our use of your personal data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the Company’s policy that you should know exactly what personal data we collect from you and how we will use it. We operate in accordance with the Saloca Ltd Data Protection Policy. We collect personal data from you for the purpose of processing your order or enquiry. We may use your personal data to supply products and services to you that you have requested, carry out any agreement with you or take any steps that you have requested. In particular, we may:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">update you as to the status of your order or booking;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alert you to important product revisions or updates;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inform you about upgrades to your purchases, bookings or Company offerings;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate your transactions with third parties providing goods and services though our site;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ensure that you are properly registered to receive technical support.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personalise and tailor our services to you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicate with you, which may include email or phone calls.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyse your use of our site and gather feedback to enable us to continually improve our site and your user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With your permission and/or where permitted by law, we may also use your personal data for marketing purposes, which may include contacting you by email and text message with information, news, and offers on our services. You will not be sent any unlawful marketing or spam. We will always work to fully protect your rights and comply with our obligations under the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and you will always have the opportunity to opt-out and you will not be discriminated against if you choose to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where you have given us appropriate permission or where we are permitted&nbsp; by law, we may use your personal data for the following purposes and direct marketing (‘Additional Purposes’):</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tell you about special discounts on additional Company products and services;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tell you about new Company products and services;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tell you about new products from other carefully screened companies that the Company feels may be of interest to you (we carefully screen and then select such companies only when we are satisfied that their products and/or services are likely to be of interest to you).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that you wish to be removed from this process you can opt out from the footer of all marketing emails or please contact our team on privacy@appointedd.com .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregate data is general data about groups of customers and does not identify individual customers. The Company may combine your data with that of other individuals to create aggregate data that we will use to improve our products &amp; services and develop new ones. For example, we may tell a third party how many people purchased a certain product, but not that you personally purchased a specific item.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also be aware that we may occasionally provide links from our website to other sites that we think will interest you. If you click on a banner advertisement or any other link, the ‘click’ will take you off the Company site. Once you leave the Company website, any information that you may have provided remains with us and is not forwarded to the next site to which you have linked. Personal data that you may choose to provide to a third party website linked to from the Company website will be subject to the privacy policy of the operators of the third party website. The Company is not responsible for the use or protection of personal data you disclose to a third party website operator, even if reached from the Company website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long will we keep your data?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company uses a variety of Web technologies on our websites. Among these are cookies, which are pieces of information that our websites provide to your browser. Cookies allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer. Cookies also allow us to customise your visit to our websites by recognising you when you return. Cookies cannot be used to see any other data on your computer, nor can they determine your e-mail address or identity. Full details of how we use cookies can be found in our Cookie Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclosing and sharing your data</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company may also transfer personal data to the Company-affiliated companies in other countries. These may be outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). By supplying personal data to the Company, you consent to any such transfer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is adhered to by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where we use certain service providers. We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the purposes of CCPA a list of categories of personal information disclosed to our external third parties in the last twelve months is included below.&nbsp; This information was disclosed to perform services on behalf of the business, i.e. to provide you with online booking services.&nbsp; Categories disclosed include: (a) identifiers, (b) customer records information, (c) commercial information and (d) internet or other electronic network activity information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please contact us at privacy@appointedd.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the Company’s policy that you are kept in control of the ways in which we use your personal data for the Additional Purposes. All Company communications, in whatever medium, that involve the recording of personal data for these Additional Purposes include a short section that allows you to indicate your preferences with respect to the use of that personal data. You can choose whether or not you wish to receive additional information or promotional offers from the Company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security of your data</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you access your personal data?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to privacy@appointedd.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will respond to your subject access request within one month of receiving it, unless otherwise specified by law. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months (90 days) from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.&nbsp; Under the CCPA a consumer can make this request twice in a 12 month period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you contact us?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To contact us about anything to do with your personal data and data protection, including to make a subject access request, please use the following details:</span></p>

Further information regarding your right to Data Portability is contained in our Data Protection Policy.&nbsp; If you require assistance in exporting data please contact our customer service team privacy@appointedd.com. In the event that our clients request their information to be deleted, we endeavour to do so within 6 months. All cancelled accounts will have personal information deleted no more than 6 months, as routine, after the last date of billing. Account information is then stored for a further 30 days as a backup. This information is encrypted with access granted to a limited number of authorised personnel.</span></p>

These communications may include service messages, subscription renewal notices, critical notices or legally mandated notices.</span></p>
