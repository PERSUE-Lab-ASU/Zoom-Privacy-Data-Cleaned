For the duration of the review, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.<br>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need them to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.<br>If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 Paragraph 1 DSGVO, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests outweigh the interests of the other parties, you have the right to demand that the processing of your personal data be restricted.<br>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – apart from their storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p><p>Objection to advertising e-mails</p><p>The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation for the transmission of not expressly requested advertising and information material is hereby contradicted. The operators of the website expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam e-mails.</p><p>3. data collection on our website</p><p>Cookies</p><p>Data protection notice (DSGVO)</p><p>We use cookies to optimize this website.

The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p><p>Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”. These are text files which are stored on your computer and which enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p><p>The storage of Google Analytics cookies and the use of this analysis tool are based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user behaviour in order to optimise both his website and his advertising.</p><p>IP Anonymisation</p><p>We have activated the IP anonymization function on this website. As a result, your IP address is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before it is transmitted to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services to the website operator in connection with the use of the website and the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.</p><p>Browser Plugin</p><p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

This allows us to generate reports that contain information about the age, gender and interests of the site visitors. This data is derived from interest-based advertising by Google as well as from visitor data from third parties. This data cannot be assigned to a specific person. You can disable this feature at any time in the ad settings in your Google Account or generally prohibit Google Analytics from collecting your information as described in the “Opting out of data collection” section.</p><p>Google Analytics Remarketing</p><p>Our websites use the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing in conjunction with the cross-device functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p><p>This feature allows you to link the advertising audiences created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to you on one device (e.g. mobile phone) depending on your previous usage and surfing behavior can also be displayed on another of your devices (e.g. tablet or PC).</p><p>If you have given us permission, Google will link your web and app browsing history to your Google Account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be displayed on any device that you sign in with your Google Account.</p><p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated user IDs that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to help us define and create audiences for cross-device advertising.</p><p>You can opt-out of cross-device remarketing/targeting permanently by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account, following this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.</p><p>The aggregation of the collected data in your Google Account is based solely on your consent, which you can give or withdraw to Google (article 6, paragraph 1, letter a DSGVO). For data collection operations that are not merged into your Google Account (e.g. because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merging), the collection of data is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter f of the DPA. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that the website operator has an interest in the anonymised analysis of website visitors for advertising purposes.</p><p>Further information and the data protection regulations can be found in the Google data protection declaration at: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.</p><p>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</p><p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”).</p><p>As part of Google AdWords, we use what is known as conversion tracking. When you click on an ad placed by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that the Internet browser stores on the user’s computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not expired, Google and we may recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to that page.</p><p>Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The cookies cannot be tracked across the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to compile conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted in to conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this use by easily disabling the Google conversion tracking cookie on your web browser under User Preferences. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p><p>The storage of “conversion cookies” and the use of this tracking tool are based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.

The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”).</p><p>The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to check whether the data input on our websites (e.g. in a contact form) is done by a human being or by an automated program. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the website visitor on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis begins automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website.

The data you enter to subscribe to the newsletter is stored on the servers of Klick-Tipp.</p><p>Data analysis by Klick-Tipp</p><p>When we send newsletters using click-tip, we can determine whether a newsletter message was opened and which links were clicked on, if any.</p><p>Klick-Tipp also allows us to divide the newsletter recipients into different categories (so-called tagging). The newsletter recipients can be divided, for example, according to gender, personal preferences (e.g. vegetarian or non-vegetarian) or customer relationship (e.g. customer or potential customer).
