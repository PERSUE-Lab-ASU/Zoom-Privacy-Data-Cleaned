        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Colibri Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Alterra.ai, Inc. (d.b.a. Colibri.ai) ("Colibri",
            "we", "our" or "us") regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the information of users of the Colibri website
            located at <a href="http://colibri.ai">http://colibri.ai</a> (the "Site") and the services, features, products, content or applications we make
            available, including the mobile application called "Colibri" (the "Application") (collectively with the Site, the
            "Services"). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Services,
            through your user account on the Services (your "Account"); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from
            third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer,
            manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
        <h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>

        <p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") gathered
            when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal
            Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners. Our business
            partners include brands that make available through the Services their own products and services. </p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but
            not limited to any business partner or other third party websites, services and applications ("Third Party Services")
            that you elect to access through the Services. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Part
            Services that share our respect for your privacy, we have no control over, do not review, and cannot take
            responsibility for these Third Party Services, the content therein, or the privacy policies of those Third
            Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access. </p>

        <h2>What Information Do We Collect and How is Such Information Used? </h2>
        <p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with
            certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information.
            We collect the following types of information from our users. </p>

        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong></p>
        <p>When you create an Account, you may provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your
            username, password and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account
            on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and
            therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you messages about our Services. You may
            unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings or by clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the
            bottom of marketing emails, although we, regardless, reserve the right to continue sending you non-marketing emails,
            such as emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you. </p>
        <p>The Services may allow users to log in and create an Account through your Facebook, Google, Zoom or
            similar account (each a "Third Party Account") using your respective ID. If you log in to the Services through your Third
            Party Account, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the Third Party
            Account’s terms of use in your use of the Services. We may receive information from such Third Party Accounts and
            that information may be imported to the Services (either as a part of your profile or otherwise). We will use all
            information available through a Third Party Account in accordance with the Third Party Account’s policies and your
            account privacy settings selected through the Third Party Account, so please consult such policies and
            settings. </p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of your Third Party Account and that it is
            your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of each Third Party Account. We will not be liable
            for: (i) the availability or accuracy of your Third Party Account; (ii) the content, products or services on or
            available on your Third Party Account or (iii) your use of your Third Party Account. </p>

        <p><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong></p>
        <p>When you use the Services, you may provide us with your audio recordings ("Audio Recordings") and any text,
            images or videos that you upload or provide to us in the context of the Services.</p>
        <p>We also collect information that you include in your profile, such as your photo and birthday.</p>

        <p><strong>Information you provide us about others:</strong></p>
        <p>If you choose to collaborate on a task with your co-workers or friends, or refer us to them, you provide us
            with the email address and contact information of your co-workers or friends.</p>

        <p>If you provide an Audio Recording, this may contain the Personal Information of third parties. Before you do
            so, please make sure you have the necessary permissions from your co-workers, friends or other third parties
            before sharing Personal Information or referring them to us.</p>

        <p><strong>Information Collected from Other Sources:</strong></p>
        <p>We may receive your information from services you integrate with Colibri. If you provide third-party account
            credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts ("Third Party Account
            Information") will be transmitted into your Colibri account, and that Third Party Account Information
            transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Further, our products may request permissions to take actions on your behalf using your third-party account
            credentials. For example, if you choose to integrate Colibri products with your Zoom or Slack account, Colibri
            products will request authority to read incoming messages and send emails on your behalf. </p>

        <p><strong>Financial Information:</strong></p>
        <p>We do not collect financial information. However, we receive transaction information from our payment processor Square.</p>

        <p><strong>Other Information:</strong></p>
        <p>We may collect your phone number and the unique device ID number of the mobile device on which you use the
            Application. </p>
        <p>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any
            other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. </p>
        <p>When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional personal information. </p>
        <p>We also collect other types of personal information that you provide to us voluntarily. </p>
        <p>If you participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion, we will collect any data you provide in
            connection with that promotion. </p>
        <p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Services. </p>
        <p>We may also collect personal information at other points in our Services that state that personal information is
            being collected. </p>

        <p><strong>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you use our Services, some information is automatically collected. For example, when you use our Services,
                how you use the Services, information about the type of device you use, your Open Device Identification Number,
                date/time stamps for your visit, your unique device identifier, your browser type, operating system, Internet
                Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This information is generally used to help us deliver
                the most relevant information to you and administer and improve the Services. In addition, in the event our
                Application crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software
                version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of
                our Application.
            </li>
            <li>We may gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, including IP addresses, browser type,
                Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
                We use this information to improve the content of the Services, market research purposes, to communicate
                information to visitors and to better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.
            </li>
            <li>We use third party analytics services to help analyze how users use the Services. These analytics services use
                Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Services and we use the information to
                improve our Services and Services. The analytics services’ ability to use and share information collected by them is
                restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how
                these entities use this information.
            </li>
            <li>We may collect and create anonymous and/or deidentified data records about how both unregistered and
                registered users, collectively, use the Services ("Aggregate Information"), such as the number and frequency of visitors to
                the Site or Application. Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. We reserve the right to
                use Aggregate Information for any purpose and disclose it to third parties in our sole discretion. This
                Aggregate Information is not Personal Information and we use reasonable efforts to ensure that it cannot be tied
                back to you, your Account, your web browser or mobile device. We use this anonymous data to enhance the content
                of our Services and improve the Services, for example by allowing us and third parties authorized by us to
                figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Email Communications:</strong></p>
        <p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer
            service. </p>
        <p><strong>Information Collected Using Cookies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser or mobile device
                when you access a website. The information we gather helps us to better understand how you use the Services in order
                to improve your user experience and the way the Services operate. Your browser or mobile device stores cookies
                in a manner associated with each website or application you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to
                recognize your web browser or mobile device and tell us how and when you use the Services.
            </li>
            <li>Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information
                collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use
                cookies to identify that your web browser or mobile device has accessed aspects of the Services and may
                associate that information with your Account if you have one.
            </li>
            <li>Most browsers or mobile devices have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your
                browser or mobile device from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your
                browser or mobile device software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We
                strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they may enable you to take advantage of some features
                of the Services.
            </li>
            <li>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do
                not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or mobile device. For example, third party
                websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer or mobile device.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons:</strong></p>
        <p>We don’t serve advertisements. We may serve it in the future. In that case, this Policy will be amended
            accordingly. </p>
        <p><strong>General Uses of Information:</strong></p>

            disclosed to you in connection with our Services. For example, we may use your information to: </p>

        </ul>
        <p>We may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries. </p>
        <p>We may get information about you from other sources. We may add this to information we get from the Services. </p>
        <h2>How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared? </h2>
        <p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information
            generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties. </p>

        <p><strong>Public Information about Your Activity on the Services:</strong></p>
        <p>Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to,
            content you have posted publicly on the Site or Application or otherwise through the Services. </p>
        <p>Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts. Unregistered users will not
            have this association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be
            tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us. </p>
        <p>Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the
            Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be
            publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our
            control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think
            carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information
            that you submit through the Services. </p>

        <p><strong>IP Address Information:</strong></p>
        <p>While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however,
            share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and
            as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p>User Profile Information:</p>
        <p>User profile information including your username and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to
            facilitate user interaction within the Services. We will not directly reveal user email addresses to other
            users. </p>
        <p><strong>Financial Information:</strong></p>
        <p>We do not collect financial information. </p>

        <p><strong>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</strong></p>
        <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one
            of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go
            out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by
            a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue
            to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may share your Personal
            Information with our subsidiaries and affiliates. </p>

        <p><strong>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:</strong></p>
        <p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Personal Information as it reasonably
            believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this
            Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect,
            prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v)
            protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other
            companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention. </p>

        <p><strong>Information We Share With Your Consent:</strong></p>
        <p>We may share your Personal Information to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it, for any other purpose
            disclosed by us when you provide the information, with your consent, or to third parties designated by you. </p>
        <h2>Is Information About Me Secure?</h2>
        <p>Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent
            unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately
            and limiting access to your computer, phone, and browser or other device by signing off after you have finished
            accessing your Account. </p>
        <p>We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the
            security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may
            compromise the security of user information at any time. </p>
        <p>We otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information, using industry-standard
            techniques. We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the
            integrity and security of Personal Information that we collect and maintain. While we use reasonable efforts
            to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and we do not guarantee or
            warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal
            Information or otherwise.</p>
        <h2>What Information of Mine Can I Access? </h2>
        <p>If you are a registered user, you can access and edit information associated with your Account by logging into the
            Services. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings. </p>

        <p><strong>California Privacy Rights:</strong></p>
        <p>Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice
            identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties
            for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a
            California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address:

        <h2><strong>How Long Do You Store My Information?</strong></h2>
        <p>Colibri stores all Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set out in this Policy,
            or for as long as we are required to do so by law or in order to comply with a regulatory obligation. When
            deleting Personal Information, we will take measures to render such Personal Information irrecoverable or
            irreproducible, and the electronic files which contain Personal Information will be permanently deleted.</p>

        <h2><strong>How Can I Delete My Account? </strong></h2>
        <p>Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by emailing  <a href="mailto:info@colibri.ai">info@colibri.ai</a>. If you terminate your
            Account, any association between your Account and information we store will no longer be accessible through your
            Account. However, given the nature of sharing on the Services, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion
            will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the public. We may retain an archived copy of your
            records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. </p>

        <h2>What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use some of the features of the Services without registering for an Account, thereby limiting the type
                of information that we collect.
            </li>
            <li>You can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take advantage
                of some of our features.
            </li>
            <li>You can delete your Account. Please note that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the
                Account, and activity generated prior to deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly accessible.
            </li>
            <li>You may opt-out of providing your Personal Information to the Application at any time by uninstalling the
                Application.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy? </h2>
        <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy
            Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use
            information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email and will change the Effective
            Date (below). A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such

            Information we’re collecting, how we’ll use it, and the types of third parties with whom we may share it. This

        <p>As established and described in this Privacy Policy, we’ll give you choices about the ways we use and share your
            Personal Information, and we’ll respect the choices you make. </p>

        <p><strong>Accountability for Onward Transfer</strong></p>
        <p>If we transfer your Personal Information to another country, we may remain liable and will take appropriate
            measures to protect your privacy and the Personal Information we transfer. </p>

        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>We’ll take appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect your Personal Information from

        <p><strong>Legal Bases for Processing EU Users’ Personal Information</strong></p>
        <p>We only process your information when we have the legal basis to do so. That is, we will only process your
            Personal Information when: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We need it to provide you the Services;</li>
            <li>It satisfies Colibri’s legitimate interests (which are not overridden by your data protection interests), such
                as for improving, marketing, and promoting the Services and protecting our legal rights;
            </li>
            <li>We need to process your data to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We may transfer your Personal Information to Colibri-affiliated entities in third parties in the United States or
            other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside.
            When we transfer Personal Information of customers in the European Economic Area or Switzerland to any such country,
            we make use of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, European Commission-approved
            standard contractual data protection clauses, binding corporate rules, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the
            transfer. Please refer to the Section “EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield” below. </p>

        <p><strong>EU Users’ Rights to Control Personal Information</strong></p>
        <p>You have control over your Personal Information. Below are the rights you have and the steps you can take to exercise
            them. Please note that your rights may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would
            reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your employer are permitted
            by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep, and it may take time for us to investigate your request. If
            you believe that we are not respecting your rights with regard to your Personal Information, you may lodge a
            complaint with your local supervisory authority. </p>

        <p><strong>Right to Access</strong></p>
        <p>You have a right to request a copy of the Personal Information that Colibri holds. To request this information,

            information. You can change your Colibri account information on the “Settings” page, and if you have any further
            concerns regarding the accuracy of your information, please email us at  <a href="mailto:info@colibri.ai">info@colibri.ai</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Right to Erasure, Restriction, or Objection to Processing</strong></p>

            purpose, or if you want us to erase your Personal Information altogether, please email us at  <a href="mailto:info@colibri.ai">info@colibri.ai</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent</strong></p>

            withdraw that consent by emailing us at  <a href="mailto:info@colibri.ai">info@colibri.ai</a>. Your withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of our
            processing of your Personal Information prior to the withdrawal. </p>

        <h2>Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>

        <p><strong>Methods of processing</strong></p>
        <p>Colibri takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or
            unauthorized destruction of the Data.</p>
        <p>The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures
            and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to Colibri, in some cases, the Data may be
            accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of Colibri (administration,
            sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service
            providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary,
            as Data Processors by Colibri. The updated list of these parties may be requested from Colibri at any time.</p>

        <p><strong>Legal basis of processing</strong></p>

        <p>Colibri may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
                <p style="margin: 0 0 0 1em">Note: Under some legislations Colibri may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects
                    to such processing ("opt-out"), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal
                    bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European
                    data protection law; provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the
                    User and/or for any precontractual obligations thereof;</p>
            </li>
            <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Colibri is subject;</li>
            <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                official authority vested in Colibri;</li>
            <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Colibri or
                by a third party.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In any case, Colibri will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and
            in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
            necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

        <p><strong>Place</strong></p>
        <p>The Data is processed at Colibri's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in
            the processing are located.</p>
        <p>Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country
            other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check
            the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>

        <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European
            Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more
            countries and about the security measures taken by Colibri to safeguard their Data.</p>

        <p>If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document
            or inquire with Colibri using the information provided in the contact section.</p>

        <p><strong>Retention time</strong></p>
        <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.</p>
        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between Colibri and the
                User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
            <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of Colibri’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as
                needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests
                pursued by Colibri within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting Colibri.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Colibri may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such
            processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, Colibri may be obliged to retain Personal
            Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order
            of an authority.</p>

        <p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right
            to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration
            of the retention period.</p>

        <h2>The purposes of processing</h2>

        <p>The Data concerning the Users is collected to allow Colibri to provide its Service, comply with its legal
            obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of its Users or
            third parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent activity, as well as the following: Analytics,
            Infrastructure monitoring, Tag Management, Hosting and backend infrastructure, Managing contacts and sending
            messages, User database management, Handling payments and Managing support and contact requests.</p>
        <p>For specific information about the Personal Data used for each purpose, the User may refer to the section
            "Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data".</p>

        <h2 id="processing-of-personal-data">Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>Personal Data is collected for the following purposes and using the following third-party service providers (each, a “sub-processor”):</p>

        <h4>Analytics</h4>

            other Google services.</p>
        <p>Google may use the Data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.</p>

        <h4>Handling payments</h4>
        <p>Unless otherwise specified, Colibri processes any payments by credit card via external payment service providers.
            In general and unless where otherwise stated, Users are requested to provide their payment details and personal
            information directly to such payment service providers. Colibri isn't involved in the collection and
            processing of such information: instead, it will only receive a notification by the relevant payment service
            provider as to whether payment has been successfully completed. The payment processors are responsible for
            the processing of your Personal Information, and may use your Personal Information for their own purposes in
            accordance with their privacy policies.</p>
