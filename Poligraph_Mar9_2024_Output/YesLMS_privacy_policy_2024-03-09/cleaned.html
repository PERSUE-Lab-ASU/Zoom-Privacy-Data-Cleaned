An authorized party may submit requests on your behalf. The authorized party must provide a valid power of attorney, or proof of registration with the California Secretary of State as an authorized agent on your behalf.</p><p>Generally, California residents have the following rights:</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; To request a disclosure of the personal information that has been collected; the categories of sources from which the information was collected; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information; the categories of third parties with which the personal information may be shared; and access to the specific personal information in a portable format.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; To request that a business delete any personal information about the consumer, subject to certain exceptions.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; To opt out of the sale of personal information to third parties at any time please click on the Do not sell my personal information file, make a download, fill it out the request and submit it to <a href="mailto:info@yeslms.com">info@yeslms.com</a>.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; To not be denied a product or service, charged a different price or rate, or denied a discount or other benefit because the consumer exercised any of his/her rights under the CCPA.</p><h3><strong>Who does CCPA apply to?</strong></h3><p>CCPA applies to California residents only. For purposes of CCPA, a California resident is a person who currently lives in California or is domiciled in California but is outside of the state for a temporary or transitory purpose. The rights described above do not apply to residents of other U.S. states or persons who reside outside of the United States.</p><p>There are certain activities, information, and circumstances involving the collection, use, processing, sale, or disclosure of personal information that are exempt or excluded from CCPA. CCPA exemptions and exclusions include, but are not limited to:</p><p>Personal information collected or sold if every aspect of the commercial transaction takes place wholly outside of California.</p><p>Deidentified or aggregate consumer information.</p><p><strong>GLBA:</strong> The CCPA does not apply to personal information collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations (GLBA). GLBA is the federal law that regulates the collection, disclosure, and safeguarding of individuals’ nonpublic personal information who obtain financial products or services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes from a financial institution. For example, if you are a California resident and you have a personal financial product with us, such as a personal credit card, the CCPA rights do not apply to the personal information associated with that account. There are other types of personal information that are not covered by the rights and limitations in the CCPA.</p><p><strong>Fair Credit Reporting Act: </strong>CCPA does not apply to any activity involving the collection, maintenance, disclosure, sale, communication, or use of any personal information bearing on an individual’s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living by a consumer reporting agency, user or furnisher of consumer reports as defined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p><p><strong>Business-to-Business Relationships:</strong> Until January 1, 2021, CCPA access and deletion requests do not apply to personal information that (1) reflects written or verbal communications or transactions between YesLMS and you, and (2) was collected while you were acting in the capacity of an employee, owner, officer, director, or contractor of a company, in the context of YesLMS’s LLC business relationship with that company. For these purposes, a company includes sole proprietors, partnerships, non-profits, and government entities.</p><p><strong>Employment Related Activity: </strong>Until January 1, 2021, CCPA access, opt out, and deletion requests do not apply to personal information that is (1) collected about you in the course of acting as a former or current job applicant, employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of YesLMS, and (2) used solely in the context of that role. This exemption also applies to personal information of others collected in the course of your acting in one of these roles, if it is your emergency contact information or necessary to administer your benefits.</p><h3><strong>What can I expect if I exercise any of my rights?</strong></h3><p><strong>Opt Out</strong></p><p>You will not receive a confirmation to a request to opt-out. Consistent with applicable law, we will opt you out of sales at your request.</p><p><strong>Access</strong></p><p>You will receive a response to your verified request within 45 days of submission, unless we notify you prior to the 45 days that the delivery date of response will be extended by an additional 45 days.
