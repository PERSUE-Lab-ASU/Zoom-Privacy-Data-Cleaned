If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, these should always be directed to the relevant data controller since they are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data. </span></p><p data-reactid=\"403\"><span data-reactid=\"404\">Mentornity may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances. </span></p><p data-reactid=\"405\"><span data-reactid=\"406\">For example, if you create an account with us to organize your mentoring/coaching/consultancy program, Mentornity will be a data controller in respect of the Personal Data that you provide as part of your account. We will also be a data controller of the Personal Data that we have obtained about the use of the Applications or Mentornity Properties, which could relate to Organisers or Customers. We use this to conduct research and analysis to help better understand and serve Users of the Services as well as to improve our platform and provide you with more targeted recommendations about events we think may be of interest to you. </span></p><p data-reactid=\"407\"><span data-reactid=\"408\">However, if you register for an Organisation as a Member, we will process your Personal Data to help administer that Organisation on behalf of the Organiser (for example, sending confirmation, notification and feedback emails, processing payments, etc.) and to help the Organiser target, and understand the success of, their program (for example, providing event/meeting reports, using analytics to gain insights into the effectiveness of various marketing channels, etc.). In these circumstances, Mentornity merely provides the \"tools\" for Organisers; Mentornity does not decide what Personal Data to request on registration forms, nor is it responsible for the continued accuracy any Personal Data provided. Any questions that you may have relating to your Personal Data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the Organiser as the data controller, not to Mentornity.</span></p><h2 data-reactid=\"412\"><span data-reactid=\"413\">11.

When you interact with the Services, we may collect Non-Personal Data. The limitations and requirements in this Privacy Policy on our collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage/retention of Personal Data do not apply to Non-Personal Data.This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Mentornity platform (\u201cThird Party Services\u201d), or any other third party products, services or businesses.If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Site(s), Applications or any other aspect of Mentornity\u2019s business.3. Personal Data We Collect And Receive.When you use or interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data. Sometimes this will be on our own behalf and other times this will be on behalf of an Organiser using our Services. This is an important distinction for EU and Turkey data protection law purposes and is explained in more detail in Section Data Protection Regulations.3.1 Customer Data.Information you provide to us: For all Users we collect Personal Data when you voluntarily provide such information to the Services, such as when you register for access to the Services, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or browse or use certain parts of the Services. The Personal Data we may collect includes without limitation your name, address, email address and other information that enables Users to be personally identified.3.2 Organisers.As an Organiser, we will collect additional Personal Data from you.Information you provide to us: In addition to information you provide to us, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Mentornity (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address. If you use our payment processing services, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your bank account information or an address to send checks) as necessary to facilitate payments and information required for tax purposes (e.g., your taxpayer identification number).Information we obtain from other sources: We may also collect or receive Personal Data from third party sources, such as third party websites, your bank, our payment processing partners and credit reporting agencies.3.3 Members.As a Member we will collect additional Personal Data from you, sometimes for our own purposes and other times on behalf of an Organiser (see Section Data Protection Regulations for more information).Information you provide via Mentornity Properties or Applications: If you register a paid event or meeting, you will provide financial information (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) some of which may constitute Personal Data. In addition, Organisers can set up organisation application forms for letting users apply to Organisations, feedback forms to get information from you before and after the meetings or events, or surveys to collect virtually any information from Members. Organisers may also collect additional Personal Data about Members. Mentornity does not control an Organiser's application/registration process nor the Personal Data that they additionally collect. Personal Data collected on behalf of Organisers is provided to the Organiser in accordance with How We Disclose and Transfer Your Personal Data.If, as a Member, you use our payment processing services, (e.g., organising paid events or meetings) we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your bank account information or an address to send checks) as necessary to facilitate payments and information required for tax purposes (e.g., your taxpayer identification number).Information we obtain from other sources: We may also collect or receive Personal Data from third party sources, such as Organisers, other Customers, social media or other third party integrations, your credit card issuing bank, our payment processing partners or other third parties. 3.4 Other Information.Mentornity also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:3.4.1 Organisation and Account Information.To create and update an Organisation, or to join an Organisation, you or Organisers supply Mentornity with first name, last name, email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details.3.4.2 Usage Information.Services metadata: When a User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way Users work. For example, Mentornity logs the activities, features you use, content and links you interact with.Log data:  As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.Device information: Mentornity collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.Location information: We receive information from you and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. Mentornity may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.3.4.3 Cookie Information.Mentornity uses cookies and similar technologies in our Applications and Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the Applications and Services and across other websites and online services. For more details about how we use these technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.3.4.5 Third Party Services.User can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and User can enable and disable these integrations. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with Mentornity. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported, we may receive user name and email address of User, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to Mentornity to facilitate the integration. Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Mentornity. When a Third Party Service is enabled, Mentornity is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to Mentornity in accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third Party Services when connecting them to the Services.3.4.6 Third Party Data.Mentornity may receive data about Organisations, Application visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.3.4.7 Additional Information Provided to Mentornity.We receive Other Information when submitted to our Applications or if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Mentornity.Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Personal Data. However, certain Personal Data is collected automatically and, if some Personal Data, such as Organisation setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.4. How We Use Your Personal Data.We collect and use the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may use the Personal Data as follows:4.1 Specific reason.If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the purpose for which it was provided.

You can enable or disable these emails and notifications in Notification Settings4.5 Organiser Emails.We allow Organisers to use our email tools to contact or send announcement to Members, so you may receive emails from our system that originate with such Organisers and that we send on their behalf.

You can enable or disable these emails and notifications in Notification Settings4.6 Administrative Matters.We may need to contact you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.4.7 Security Matters.We may need to use Personal Data to investigate and prevent security issues and abuse.4.8 Aggregated Personal Data.To serve our Users better, we often conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information that we collect. This research is typically conducted on an aggregate basis only that does not identify you. Once Personal Data is in an aggregated form, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, it becomes Non-Personal Data.5. How We Disclose And Transfer Personal Data.We will not sell your Personal Data to third parties, including third party advertisers. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below.5.1 Customer\u2019s Instructions.Mentornity will share and disclose Personal Data in accordance with a Customer's instructions in compliance with applicable law and legal process.5.2 Organisers.When you become Member and join to Organisation, or to participate any event or meeting at Organisation, we provide the Personal Data you entered to the Organiser. Organiser may, but need not, allow Organisation Members to view other Members' Personal Data.5.3 Displaying the Services.When a User submits Personal Data, it may be displayed to other  Users, or anonymous users. For example, User\u2019s Personal Data may be shared anonymously when Organisation sets visibility of its Members public.###\u00a05.4 Collaborating With Members.The Services provide different ways for Users collaborate, send/receive messages, set meetings. Personal Data, such as a User\u2019s profile Information, may be shared, subject to the policies and practices of the other Organisations.5.5 Third Party Service Providers and Partners.We may share your Personal Data with our contractors and service providers who process Personal Data on behalf of Mentornity to perform certain business-related functions.

For example, if you connect with LinkedIn, we store your contact list and skills.5.7 Business Transfers.As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.

Storing Personal Data and Security.We may store Personal Data itself or such information may be stored by third parties to whom we have transferred it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data collected via the Services from loss, misuse, unauthorized use, access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration and destruction.

Data Protection Regulations.Mentornity may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than the one in which you live, to distribute our Services and make the Service fast and available at any location globally. We deploy the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European Union and Switzerland, Ki\u015fisel Verilerin Korunmas\u0131 Kanunu (KVKK) for Turkey if Mentornity transfers Personal Data originating from these countries to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection law.EEA, Switzerland and UK OnlyThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) In May 2018, a new data privacy law known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (or the \"GDPR\") becomes effective. The GDPR requires Mentornity and Organisers using the Service to provide Users with more information about the processing of their Personal Data. Turkey OnlyThe Ki\u015fisel Verilerin Korunmas\u0131 Kanunu (KVKK)In April 2018, a new data privacy law known as the Ki\u015fisel Verilerin Korunmas\u0131 Kanunu (or the \"KVKK\") becomes effective. The KVKK requires Mentornity and Organisers using the Service to provide Users with more information about the processing of their Personal Data.Here is what you need to know for GDPR and KVKK:Legal grounds for processing your Personal Data The GDPR and KVKK requires us to tell you about the legal ground we're relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Section How We Use Your Personal Data above will typically be because: you provided your consent; it is necessary for our contractual relationship; the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations; and/or the processing is in our legitimate interest as a mentorship/coaching/consultancy program management platform (for example, to protect the security and integrity of our systems and to provide you with customer service, etc.). Transfers of Personal Data As Mentornity is a global company, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally provided. This may be intra-group or to third parties that we work with who may be located in jurisdictions outside the EEA, Switzerland, the UK and Turkey which have no data protection laws or laws that are less strict compared with those in Europe and Turkey.Whenever we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland, the UK or Turkey, we take legally required steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data.Personal Data retention We retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. If you have an account with us, we will typically retain your Personal Data for a period of 90 days after you have requested that your account is closed or if it's been inactive for 7 years. Your rightsData protection law provides you with rights in respect of Personal Data that we hold about you, including the right to request a copy of the Personal Data, request that we rectify, restrict or delete your Personal Data, object to profiling and unsubscribe from marketing communications.For the most part, you can exercise these rights by logging in and visiting the Account Settings page or changing the \"cookie settings\" in your browser (see our Cookie Statement for more information). If you can't find what you're looking for in the Account Settings page, please contact us using the contact information set out in Section Dispute Resolution and Contact. Please note that requests to exercise data protection rights will be assessed by us on a case-by-case basis. There may be circumstances where we are not legally required to comply with your request because of the laws in your jurisdiction or because of exemptions provided for in data protection legislation. If you have a complaint about how we handle your Personal Data, please get in touch with us as set forth in Section Dispute Resolution and Contact to explain. If you are not happy with how we have attempted to resolve your complaint, you may contact the relevant data protection authority. Mentornity as a data controller and a data processor EU and Turkey data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as \"data controllers\") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as \"data processors\"). If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, these should always be directed to the relevant data controller since they are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data. Mentornity may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances. For example, if you create an account with us to organize your mentoring/coaching/consultancy program, Mentornity will be a data controller in respect of the Personal Data that you provide as part of your account. We will also be a data controller of the Personal Data that we have obtained about the use of the Applications or Mentornity Properties, which could relate to Organisers or Customers. We use this to conduct research and analysis to help better understand and serve Users of the Services as well as to improve our platform and provide you with more targeted recommendations about events we think may be of interest to you. However, if you register for an Organisation as a Member, we will process your Personal Data to help administer that Organisation on behalf of the Organiser (for example, sending confirmation, notification and feedback emails, processing payments, etc.) and to help the Organiser target, and understand the success of, their program (for example, providing event/meeting reports, using analytics to gain insights into the effectiveness of various marketing channels, etc.). In these circumstances, Mentornity merely provides the \"tools\" for Organisers; Mentornity does not decide what Personal Data to request on registration forms, nor is it responsible for the continued accuracy any Personal Data provided. Any questions that you may have relating to your Personal Data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the Organiser as the data controller, not to Mentornity.11.
