Below is a summary of the types of third parties used:\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.\n      \n\n      \n        Business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you to provide services such as IT and system administration services, email communications, hosting services, backup services, credit card processing, research, development, marketing and customer support.\n      \n\n      \n        Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of the Bookwhen Website and Services.\n      \n\n      \n        Professional advisors acting as service providers to us in relation to the Bookwhen Website or Services - including lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.\n      \n\n      \n        Tax authorities, regulators and other authorities who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.\n      \n\n      \n        Credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score where this is a condition of us entering into a contract with you.\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      Personal data we disclose to third parties. We may disclose your personal data to third parties:\n    \n\n    \n      \n        In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.\n      \n\n      \n        If we or a member of our group of companies or substantially all of their assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by them about their customers will be one of the transferred assets.\n      \n\n      \n        If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions, terms of use and/or any other legal agreements; or to protect our rights, property, safety, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n      \n\n      \n        Including Aggregated Data in the normal course of operating our business; for example, with other Bookwhen Website or Services users, our customers or publicly to show trends or benchmark the general use of the Bookwhen Website and Services.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n    \n      International Transfers\n    \n\n    \n      Our Services are global and your personal data may be stored and processed in any country where we have operations, our staff are located or where we engage service providers engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details or the provision of support services. This will involve a transfer of your personal data to countries outside of your country of residence, where data protection rules are different from those of your country of residence.\n    \n\n    \n      Processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data to countries outside the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), Switzerland or the UK.\n    \n\n    \n      We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In particular this means that your personal data will only be transferred to a country that provides an adequate level of protection (for example, where the European Commission or the UK Data Protection Authority, (\"ICO\") has determined that a country provides an adequate level of protection) or where the recipient is bound by standard contractual clauses according to conditions provided by the European Commission or ICO.\n    \n\n    \n      The Bookwhen Website and Services are accessible via the internet and may potentially be accessed by anyone around the world. Other users may access the Bookwhen Website or Services from outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK. This means that where you chose to post your personal data on the Bookwhen Website or within the Services, it could be accessed from anywhere around the world and therefore a transfer of your personal data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK may be deemed to have occurred.\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n      Data Security\n    \n\n    \n      We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. For example all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any credit card information or payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Bookwhen Website or Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share any password with anyone. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.\n    \n\n    \n      We have put in place procedures to deal with any personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.\n    \n\n    \n      Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will endeavour to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to the Bookwhen Website or the Services. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n      Links To Other Websites\n    \n\n    \n      The Bookwhen Website and Services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n      Your Rights\n    \n\n    \n      You have the right under Data Protection Law, free of charge, to request:\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Access to your personal data.\n      \n\n      \n        Rectification or deletion of your personal data.\n      \n\n      \n        A restriction on the processing of your personal data.\n      \n\n      \n        Object to the processing of your personal data.\n      \n\n      \n        A transfer of your personal data (data portability) in a structured, machine readable and commonly used format.\n      \n\n      \n        Withdraw your consent to us processing your personal data, at any time.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us as set out at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to such queries within 30 days and deal with requests we receive from you, in accordance with the provisions of Data Protection Law. Occasionally it could take us longer, if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n    \n\n    \n      You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\n    \n\n    \n      We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n      Marketing Communications\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Marketing: We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).\n      \n\n      \n        Promotional Offers from us: We will send you marketing emails if you \u201copt in\u201d to receive marketing emails when registering on the Bookwhen Website, or if you have enquired about, or purchased any of our goods or services from us and you have not opted out of receiving such marketing.\n      \n\n      \n        Third Party Marketing: We will obtain your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.\n      \n\n      \n        Opt out: Please note that, if you change your mind about being sent marketing emails you can \u201copt out\u201d at any time by clicking the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link at the bottom of any marketing email. Once you \u201copt out\u201d, you will no longer receive any marketing emails from us. We will continue to communicate with you regarding your service billing and support via email and where we send push notifications from time to time in order to update you about any service updates, events and promotions we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these communications, please disable these in the settings on your device.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n    \n      Data Retention\n    \n\n    \n      We retain personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was provided or collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint, if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you, to comply with law enforcement requests, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, resolve disputes, enforce our legal agreements, or fulfil your request to \u201cunsubscribe\u201d from further messages from us.\n    \n\n    \n      To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.\n    \n\n    \n      This will be for as long as we provide access to the Bookwhen Website or Services to you, your account with us remains open or any period set out in any relevant contract you have with us. After you have closed your account or ceased using the Services as set out below.\n    \n\n    \n      We will retain some anonymised information after your account has been closed and we may use this for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\n    \n\n    \n      Please note: After you have closed your account or deleted information from your account, any information you have shared with others will remain visible. We do not control data that other users may have copied from the Bookwhen Website or Services. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n      Complaints\n    \n\n    \n      Our intention is to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal data. For this reason, we take complaints we receive very seriously. We encourage users to notify us if they think that our collection or use of personal data is unfair, misleading or inappropriate. If you have any complaints about our use of your personal data, please contact us as set out at the end of this Privacy Policy or contact your local data protection supervisory authority.\n    \n\n    \n      For UK individuals: The Information Commissioner's Office at, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF, England.\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n      Age Of Users\n    \n\n    \n      The Bookwhen Website and the Services are not intended for and shall not be used by anyone under the age of 18.\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n      Changes To Our Privacy Policy\n    \n\n    \n      Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by email.
