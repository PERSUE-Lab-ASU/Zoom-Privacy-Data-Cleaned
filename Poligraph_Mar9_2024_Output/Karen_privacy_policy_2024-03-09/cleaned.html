                            Subscription Service, either by site visitors providing their contact information or when a
                            Subscription Service user adds the information, is stored and managed on our service
                            providers' servers. This information is then used to contact visitors about their interest
                            in the company's goods or services and interact with the company. Karenapp provides the

                            client data for as long as needed. This means, we will retain client data for as long as the
                            client has a current and active account with Karen. As outlined in our standard contract
                            terms, once a client’s term has expired or has been terminated, then Karen will no longer
                            retain the client data. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date
                            if you so request.</p>
