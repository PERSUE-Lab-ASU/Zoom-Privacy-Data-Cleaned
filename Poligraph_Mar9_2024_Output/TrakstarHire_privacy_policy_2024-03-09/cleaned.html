<ul>
<li>To our subsidiaries and affiliates.</li>

These providers are detailed in the Sub-processors list within the Trakstar Data Processing Addendum.

<li>With your consent.</li>

<p>Even though we do not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States (the <strong>"Privacy Shield"</strong>), we do continue to comply with the commitments set forth below that we made when we certified to the Privacy Shield principles (<strong>"Privacy Shield Principles"</strong>). Trakstar has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view the Trakstar certification, please visit <a class="link_hire" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a></p>
<p>Further, Trakstar will execute a <a class="link_hire" href="/data-processing-addendum/">Data Processing Addendum</a> with customers to whom this legislation applies. For clarity, Trakstar clients are the data controllers and Trakstar is a data processor, as such terms are defined by the GDPR. Note that where there is a conflict between the terms in this privacy policy, the Privacy Shield Principles, and the GDPR legislation, the GDPR legislation shall govern.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Trakstar commits to resolve complaints about Trakstar’s collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding the Trakstar Privacy Shield policy, the Trakstar Data Processing Addendum, or Trakstar compliance with GDPR should first contact ATSI at the support email address included within this policy.</p>
<p>Trakstar has further committed to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regards to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship. If timely acknowledgment of your complaint is not received from Trakstar, or if Trakstar has not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the EU DPAs for more information or to file a complaint. The services of EU DPAs are provided at no cost to you.</p>
<p>Trakstar commits to cooperate with EU DPA’s and comply with the advice given by EU DPAs with regards to human resources data transferred to Trakstar in the context of the employment relationship.</p>
<p>We sometimes provide personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer personal information received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, the third party's access, use, and disclosure of the personal information must also be in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and we will remain liable under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<h3 class="mb-3 bg_lighter ps-3 pb-3 pt-2 my-4 display-title">Data Security</h3>
<p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions and other information will be encrypted using SSL technology.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Application, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Application like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Application.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Application. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Application.</p>
<h3 class="mb-3 bg_lighter ps-3 pb-3 pt-2 my-4 display-title">Third-party Products and Services</h3>
<p>You or the Trakstar Customer have the ability to connect third-party products and services (such as Google) to the Trakstar applications. When you use third-party products and services, their terms and privacy policies apply to your use of those products or services. This privacy policy does not apply to information collected by such third parties, and Trakstar encourages you to learn more about their privacy practices before using their products or services.</p>
<h3 class="mb-3 bg_lighter ps-3 pb-3 pt-2 my-4 display-title">Additional Limits on Use of Your Google User Data</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding anything else in this privacy policy, if you deliberately and voluntarily provide the Trakstar applications access to your Google data through an optional integration, then Trakstar’s use of that data will be subject to these additional restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trakstar’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</li>
<li>Trakstar will only use access to read, or control Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide an email client on your device that allows users to compose, send, read, and process emails which are marked with a specific label. Trakstar will never delete any email from your mailbox.</li>
<li>Trakstar will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
<li>Trakstar will not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements.</li>
<li>Trakstar will not allow humans to read this data unless Trakstar has your consent for specific conversations, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law, or for the application’s internal operations and even then, only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trakstar’s Obligations</p>
<ul>
<li>Trakstar will only process client information or your information for the contracted business purposes for which Client provides or permits access to personal information.</li>
<li>Trakstar will not process or sell client personal information for Trakstar’s own commercial purposes or in a way that does not comply with applicable data protection law. If a law requires Trakstar to disclose Client or your personal information for a purpose unrelated to the contracted business purpose, Trakstar must first inform the Client of the legal requirement and give the Client an opportunity to object or challenge the requirement, unless the law prohibits such notice.</li>
<li>Trakstar will limit its processing of client personal information or your information to activities reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the contract business purposes. Once the contracted business purposes are achieved or the agreement is terminated, Trakstar will return or destroy all Client or your personal information upon request of the Client unless Trakstar is required by a specific legal obligation to retain Client or your Personal Information. If Trakstar must retain Client or your personal information, it shall only do so for as long as is strictly necessary to fulfill such legal obligation, after which it will destroy Client or your personal information upon request of the Client.</li>
<li>Trakstar must promptly comply with any Client request or instruction from authorized persons requiring Trakstar to provide, amend, transfer, or delete Client or your Personal Information, or to stop, mitigate, or remedy any processing that may violate any applicable Data Protection Law.</li>
<li>If the contracted business purpose requires the collection of personal information from you or individuals on Client’s behalf, Trakstar will always provide appropriate notice such as this CCP compliant notice for your review.</li>
