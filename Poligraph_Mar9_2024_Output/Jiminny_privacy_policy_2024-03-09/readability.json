Data Collection &amp; Processing</h2>\n<h3>1.1. Customer Data</h3>\n<p>Our Services enable Jiminny customers to record, transcribe, analyze and share the contents of their business communications, including phone calls, video conferences, email and text messsages, as well as their CRM and customer contacts (collectively, \u201c<strong>Customer Data</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>Customer Data typically contains data which relates to identifiable individuals, such as the customer\u2019s sales representatives, prospects, and other parties either taking part in their communications or mentioned there.</p>\n<p>Certain privacy and data protection laws require that call recordings may only be initialized pursuant to one or more of the parties\u2019 consent (whether explicit or implicit, depending on applicable law), or subject to certain restrictions. Accordingly, whilst Jiminny supports these laws by providing our customers with features and options for how they use our Services \u2013 our customer is solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services and such features, and to ensure that all individuals using Jiminny on their behalf or at their request have given their informed consent to these practices, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording and use of data through our Services are fully met by them, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship.</p>\n<p>Jiminny processes Customer Data, and the personal data contained in it, strictly on our customer\u2019s behalf, in accordance with their reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, to the extent that the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), UK Data Protection Act (UKDPA) or any similar laws apply, our Customer will be deemed the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>\u2018data controller\u2019</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(under the GDPR, UKDPA and similar laws) or \u2018<strong>business</strong>\u2019 (under the CCPA or similar laws) of such Customer Data; and Jiminny will be deemed the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>\u2018data processor\u2019</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>\u2018service provider\u2019</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>when processing such data.</p>\n<h3>1.2.

Accordingly, to the extent applicable \u2013 our customer will be deemed the \u2018<strong>data controller</strong>\u2019 or \u2018<strong>business</strong>\u2019 with respect to such data; Jiminny will also be deemed an independent and separate \u2018<strong>data controller</strong>\u2019 or \u2018<strong>business</strong>\u2019 with respect to such data; and with respect to those portions or copies of User Data that we process on behalf of our customer \u2013 we will also be deemed a \u2018<strong>data processor</strong>\u2019 or \u2018<strong>service provider</strong>\u2019.</p>\n<h3>1.3 Website, CRM &amp; Prospect Data</h3>\n<p>We collect and generate the following types of personal data concerning our website visitors, customers and prospects:</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li><strong>website usage information</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>including connectivity, technical and aggregated usage data, such as user agent, IP addresses, device data (like type, OS, device id, browser version, locale and language settings used), activity logs, session recordings, and the cookies and pixels installed or utilized on their device;</li>\n<li><strong>customer account information</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>such as contact, contractual and billing details concerning our customers, which may also contain the details of their internal focal persons who directly engage with Jiminny concerning their organizational account, e.g. the account administrators, billing contacts and authorized signatories on behalf of the customer; as well as the customer\u2019s needs and preferences, as identified to us or recognized through our engagement with them);</li>\n<li><strong>information concerning our customers and prospects</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>for example contact and business details, our communications with such customers and prospects (correspondences, call and video recordings, and analyses thereof), as well as any needs, preferences, attributes and insights relevant to our potential engagement).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We collect such data either automatically, through the data subject\u2019s interaction with us or with our website, Platform or Services; or through third party services, social media, analytics tools, events we organize or participate in, and other business initiatives.</p>\n<h2>2. Data Controller/Processor</h2>\n<p>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201c<strong>data controller</strong>\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201c<strong>business</strong>\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201c<strong>data processor</strong>\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201c<strong>service provider</strong>\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.</p>\n<h3>2.1. Customer Data</h3>\n<p>Jiminny is the \u201c<strong>data processor</strong>\u201d of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the \u201c<strong>data controller</strong>\u201d of such data; and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201c<strong>sub-processors</strong>\u201d of such data.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Jiminny processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with such customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer. The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data \u2013 including sufficient reference to the processing of their Personal Data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.</p>\n<h3>2.2. User Data</h3>\n<p>Jiminny is both a \u201c<strong>data controller</strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>data processor</strong>\u201d of User Data. Such data is processed by Jiminny for its own purposes (as described in Section 3 below), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.</p>\n<h3>2.3. Website, CRM &amp; Prospect Data</h3>\n<p>With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of \"<strong>data controller</strong>\" (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cdata processor\u201d.</p>\n<h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>\n<h3>3.1. Customer Data</h3>\n<p>Jiminny processes Customer Data, and the personal data contained in it, strictly on our customer\u2019s behalf, in accordance with their reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.</p>\n<h3>3.2.

Data Residency</h2>\n<p>We and our authorized Service Providers (defined below) maintain, store and process Personal Data in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other locations, as reasonably necessary for the proper performance and delivery of our Services, or as may be required by law; provided that Customer Data may only be processed in such locations as permitted in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.</p>\n<p>While privacy laws may vary between jurisdictions, Jiminny and its affiliates and Service Providers are each committed to protect Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and customary industry standards, regardless of any lesser legal requirements that may apply in their jurisdiction. Among others, we have ensured that all transfers of Personal Data which originates from the EEA and made at our direction or control are based on appropriate data transfer mechanisms as established under the GDPR.</p>\n<h2>5.

If we believe that such change in control might materially affect your Customer Data or Personal Data then stored with us, we will notify you of this event and the choices you may have via e-mail or prominent notice on our Services.</p>\n<h3>5.4. Customers and Other Users</h3>\n<p>Customer Data is typically shared and is available to the users belonging to such customer\u2019s account. User Data is shared with the administrator(s) of the customer\u2019s account to which such user belongs (including data and communications concerning such user\u2019s account). In such cases, sharing such data means that the administrator(s) or other users of the same account may access it on behalf of the customer, and will be able to monitor, process and analyze the Personal Data contained therein. This includes instances where you may contact us for help in resolving an issue specific to a team of which you are a member (and which is managed by the same customer).</p>\n<p>Please note that Jiminny is not responsible for and does not control any further disclosure, use or monitoring by or on behalf of the customer, that itself acts as the \u2018data controller\u2019 of such data (as further described in Section 2 above).</p>\n<h3>5.5.

Security</h2>\n<p>We use appropriate security measures to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. We also take measures to ensure service providers that process personal data on our behalf also have appropriate security controls in place.</p>\n<p>Please note that no service is completely secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee that any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse will never occur.</p>\n<p>To protect the confidentiality of your account and protect from unauthorized use of your account, we recommend enabling two-factor authentication for all of your external accounts used to sign-in to our Sites, Platform or Services.</p>\n<h2>7.

Customer Data\nOur Services enable Jiminny customers to record, transcribe, analyze and share the contents of their business communications, including phone calls, video conferences, email and text messsages, as well as their CRM and customer contacts (collectively, \u201cCustomer Data\u201d).\nCustomer Data typically contains data which relates to identifiable individuals, such as the customer\u2019s sales representatives, prospects, and other parties either taking part in their communications or mentioned there.\nCertain privacy and data protection laws require that call recordings may only be initialized pursuant to one or more of the parties\u2019 consent (whether explicit or implicit, depending on applicable law), or subject to certain restrictions. Accordingly, whilst Jiminny supports these laws by providing our customers with features and options for how they use our Services \u2013 our customer is solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services and such features, and to ensure that all individuals using Jiminny on their behalf or at their request have given their informed consent to these practices, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording and use of data through our Services are fully met by them, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship.\nJiminny processes Customer Data, and the personal data contained in it, strictly on our customer\u2019s behalf, in accordance with their reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.\nAccordingly, to the extent that the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), UK Data Protection Act (UKDPA) or any similar laws apply, our Customer will be deemed the\u00a0\u2018data controller\u2019\u00a0(under the GDPR, UKDPA and similar laws) or \u2018business\u2019 (under the CCPA or similar laws) of such Customer Data; and Jiminny will be deemed the\u00a0\u2018data processor\u2019\u00a0or\u00a0\u2018service provider\u2019\u00a0when processing such data.\n1.2. User Data\nWe collect and generate the following types of personal data concerning users of our Platform:\n\nprofile information\u00a0like your name, position, company, team, telephone numbers, email address, photo;\naccount information\u00a0such as email address and access tokens;\nusage and analytical information\u00a0including connectivity, technical and aggregated usage data, such as user agent, IP addresses, device data (like type, OS, device id, browser version, locale and language settings used), activity logs, session recordings, and the cookies installed or utilized on their device;\ncontent you provide through communicating with us, for example audio and/or video conversations for support and training purposes; and\nyour responses\u00a0to questionnaires, surveys, or requests for feedback.\n\nWhilst Jiminny processes such User Data on its customers\u2019 behalf (where it is included in Customer Data), we also use it for our own purposes, as described in Section 3 below. Accordingly, to the extent applicable \u2013 our customer will be deemed the \u2018data controller\u2019 or \u2018business\u2019 with respect to such data; Jiminny will also be deemed an independent and separate \u2018data controller\u2019 or \u2018business\u2019 with respect to such data; and with respect to those portions or copies of User Data that we process on behalf of our customer \u2013 we will also be deemed a \u2018data processor\u2019 or \u2018service provider\u2019.\n1.3 Website, CRM & Prospect Data\nWe collect and generate the following types of personal data concerning our website visitors, customers and prospects:\n\nwebsite usage information\u00a0including connectivity, technical and aggregated usage data, such as user agent, IP addresses, device data (like type, OS, device id, browser version, locale and language settings used), activity logs, session recordings, and the cookies and pixels installed or utilized on their device;\ncustomer account information\u00a0such as contact, contractual and billing details concerning our customers, which may also contain the details of their internal focal persons who directly engage with Jiminny concerning their organizational account, e.g. the account administrators, billing contacts and authorized signatories on behalf of the customer; as well as the customer\u2019s needs and preferences, as identified to us or recognized through our engagement with them);\ninformation concerning our customers and prospects\u00a0for example contact and business details, our communications with such customers and prospects (correspondences, call and video recordings, and analyses thereof), as well as any needs, preferences, attributes and insights relevant to our potential engagement).\n\nWe collect such data either automatically, through the data subject\u2019s interaction with us or with our website, Platform or Services; or through third party services, social media, analytics tools, events we organize or participate in, and other business initiatives.\n2. Data Controller/Processor\nCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201cdata controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cdata processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.\n2.1. Customer Data\nJiminny is the \u201cdata processor\u201d of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data; and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201csub-processors\u201d of such data.\nAccordingly, Jiminny processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with such customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer. The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data \u2013 including sufficient reference to the processing of their Personal Data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.\n2.2. User Data\nJiminny is both a \u201cdata controller\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d of User Data. Such data is processed by Jiminny for its own purposes (as described in Section 3 below), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.\n2.3. Website, CRM & Prospect Data\nWith respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of \"data controller\" (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cdata processor\u201d.\n3. How We Use Your Data\n3.1. Customer Data\nJiminny processes Customer Data, and the personal data contained in it, strictly on our customer\u2019s behalf, in accordance with their reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.\n3.2.

If you wish to revoke such consent, please contact us at\u00a0privacy@jiminny.com.\nWe do not sell your personal information for the intents and purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nSpecifically, we use this type of Personal Data for the following purposes:\n\nTo facilitate, operate, and provide our Services;\nTo train our speech-to-text engine and improve our data analytics models;\nTo train our customer and user-facing staff;\nTo authenticate the identity of our users, and to allow them access to our Services;\nTo provide our customers and users with assistance and support;\nTo gain a better understanding on how individuals use and interact with our Sites and Services, and how we could improve their and others\u2019 user experience, and continue improving our products, offerings and the overall performance of our Services;\nTo facilitate and optimize our marketing campaigns, ad management and sales operations, and to manage and deliver advertisements for our products and services more effectively, including on other websites and applications.

Data Retention\n3.1. Customer Data\nWe retain Customer Data strictly on our customer\u2019s behalf, in accordance with their reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.\n3.2.

Data Residency\nWe and our authorized Service Providers (defined below) maintain, store and process Personal Data in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other locations, as reasonably necessary for the proper performance and delivery of our Services, or as may be required by law; provided that Customer Data may only be processed in such locations as permitted in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.\nWhile privacy laws may vary between jurisdictions, Jiminny and its affiliates and Service Providers are each committed to protect Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and customary industry standards, regardless of any lesser legal requirements that may apply in their jurisdiction. Among others, we have ensured that all transfers of Personal Data which originates from the EEA and made at our direction or control are based on appropriate data transfer mechanisms as established under the GDPR.\n5. Data Sharing\n5.1. Service Providers\nWe engage selected third party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own. Such service providers include hosting and server co-location services, communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), speech-to-text services, data and cyber security services, billing and payment processing services, fraud detection and prevention services, web analytics, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, social and advertising networks, content providers, e-mail, voicemails, support and customer relation management systems, and our legal, financial and compliance advisors (collectively, \u201cService Providers\u201c).\nOur Service Providers shall each be deemed as a \u2018data processor\u2019 or \u2018service provider\u2019 in circumstances where Jiminny assumes the role of \u2018data controller\u2019; and where Jiminny acts as the \u2018data processor\u2019 or \u2018service provider\u2019 for our customer, the Service Provider shall be deemed as our \u2018sub-processor\u2019 or \u2018service provider\u2019 (as further described in Section 2 above).\nAccordingly, these Service Providers may have access to User Data and Website, CRM & Prospect Data; and if we have expressly listed them in our\u00a0Sub-Processor List, they may also have access to Customer Data \u2014 all depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services, and may only use it for such limited purposes as determined in our agreements with them.\n5.2.

Customers and Other Users\nCustomer Data is typically shared and is available to the users belonging to such customer\u2019s account. User Data is shared with the administrator(s) of the customer\u2019s account to which such user belongs (including data and communications concerning such user\u2019s account). In such cases, sharing such data means that the administrator(s) or other users of the same account may access it on behalf of the customer, and will be able to monitor, process and analyze the Personal Data contained therein. This includes instances where you may contact us for help in resolving an issue specific to a team of which you are a member (and which is managed by the same customer).\nPlease note that Jiminny is not responsible for and does not control any further disclosure, use or monitoring by or on behalf of the customer, that itself acts as the \u2018data controller\u2019 of such data (as further described in Section 2 above).\n5.5. Legal Compliance\nIn exceptional circumstances, and except as stipulated otherwise in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with you, we may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your Personal Data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b) disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such disclosure is required to protect our legitimate business interests, including the security or integrity of our products and services.\n6. Security\nWe use appropriate security measures to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. We also take measures to ensure service providers that process personal data on our behalf also have appropriate security controls in place.\nPlease note that no service is completely secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee that any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse will never occur.\nTo protect the confidentiality of your account and protect from unauthorized use of your account, we recommend enabling two-factor authentication for all of your external accounts used to sign-in to our Sites, Platform or Services.\n7. Data Subject Rights\nIndividuals have rights concerning their Personal Data. If you wish to exercise your privacy rights under any applicable law, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), such as the right to request access to, and rectification or erasure of your Personal Data held with Jiminny, or to restrict or object to such Personal Data\u2019s processing, or to port such Personal Data, or the right to equal services and prices (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you) \u2013 please contact us by e-mail at:\u00a0privacy@jiminny.com\nPlease note that when you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal information related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access. Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g. as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 3 above.\nWe may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data related to others.\nIf you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data that we process on our customer\u2019s behalf, please contact the administrator of such customer\u2019s account directly. For example, if you are our customer\u2019s customer or prospect, or if you are a user of Jiminny on behalf of our customer, and wish to access, correct, or delete data processed by Jiminny on behalf of our customer, please direct your request to the relevant customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data \u2013 see Section 2 above).
