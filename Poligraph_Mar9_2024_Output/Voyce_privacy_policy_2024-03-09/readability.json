For instance, if you have a standing credit or\n                        debt on your account, or if we believe you have committed fraud or violated our Terms, we may seek to resolve the issue before\n                        deleting your information.\n                    \n                    Access Rights\n                    \n                        Voyce will comply with individual's requests regarding access, correction, and/or deletion of the personal data it stores in\n                        accordance with applicable law.\n                    \n                    Location Information\n                    \n                        We request permission for our app's collection of location from your device per the permission system used by your mobile\n                        operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, you can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this will limit your ability to use certain features of our Services. Additionally, disabling our app's\n                        collection of location from your device will not limit our ability to derive approximate location from your IP address.\n                    \n                    Promotional Communications\n                    \n                        You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us by following the instructions in those messages.
