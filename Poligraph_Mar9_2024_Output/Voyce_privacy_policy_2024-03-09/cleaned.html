                        interpretation services ("Users"). This Policy does not apply to information we collect from or about third party interpretation service

                    <p>
                        We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services,

                    <p>When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:</p>
                    <ul class="normal">

                        <li>
                            <strong>Location Information:</strong> When you use the Services, we collect precise location data from the Voyce app to find the best
                            matched Provider. If you permit the Voyce app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile
                            operating system ("platform"), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or
                            background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.

                            requested, date and time the service was provided, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo
                            code, we may associate your name with that person.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Usage and Preference Information:</strong> We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services,
                            preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar
                            technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model,
                            operating system and version, software and file names and versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising

                            service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties' phone numbers, and the content
                            of the SMS message.

                            <strong>Log Information:</strong> When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP
                            address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the
                            third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.
                            Important Information About Platform Permissions
                            Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent.
                            And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the
                            Voyce app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android
                            devices will notify you of the permissions that the Voyce app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app
                            constitutes your consent.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Information We Collect From Other Sources</strong></p>
                    <p>

                        as required by law, or for legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law. For instance, if you have a standing credit or
                        debt on your account, or if we believe you have committed fraud or violated our Terms, we may seek to resolve the issue before
                        deleting your information.

                        Voyce will comply with individual's requests regarding access, correction, and/or deletion of the personal data it stores in

                    <p>
                        We request permission for our app's collection of location from your device per the permission system used by your mobile
                        operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, you can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this will limit your ability to use certain features of our Services. Additionally, disabling our app's
                        collection of location from your device will not limit our ability to derive approximate location from your IP address.
