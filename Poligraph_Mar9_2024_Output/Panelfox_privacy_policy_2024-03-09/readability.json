The legal basis depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:\n \n we need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, to provide customer support and personalized features, and to protect the safety and security of the Services; \n it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests; \n you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or \n we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.\n\n If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.\n Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.\n Data Retention\n We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.\n To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.\n In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see\u00a0\u2018Special rights for EU individuals\u2019\u00a0below for further information.\n In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for analytics, research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this anonymized information indefinitely without further notice to you.\n Data Transfers\n The countries to which we send data for the purposes listed above may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. If we transfer your Personal Data to third parties in other countries: (i) we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of applicable law; and (ii) we will protect the transferred Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Policy.\n Special rights for EU individuals\n Objecting to processing:\u00a0You have the right to object to processing of your Personal Data that is based on our legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms, in order to proceed with the processing of your Personal Data.\n Restricting processing:\u00a0You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of your Personal Data; (ii) you believe your Personal Data has been unlawfully processed; (iii) you need us to maintain the Personal Data solely for the purpose of a legal claim; or (iv) we are in the process of considering your objection in relation to processing on the basis of legitimate interests.\n Access, erasure and data portability:\u00a0You may have the right to request details of the Personal Data we hold about you, or to request that we erase the Personal Data we hold about you, or that we transfer this information to you or to a third party.\n Rectification:\u00a0If you believe that any Personal Data we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, please contact us using the details below.
