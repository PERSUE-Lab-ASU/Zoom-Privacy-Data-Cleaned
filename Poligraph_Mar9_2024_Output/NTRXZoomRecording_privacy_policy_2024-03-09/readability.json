If a joint controller situation is established in regard to your personal data, the essence of the legal arrangement between NICE and such other controller shall be made available to you upon request.</p>\n<h4>SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h4>\n<p>We do not, and currently do not intend to, sell any of your personal data to any third party. NICE will not transfer your personal details or any information collected pertaining to your activities on the Website (provided that such details and information identify you personally) to any third party, except in the following cases or as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>NICE reasonably believes that you have breached the Terms of Use, or performed any act or omission that NICE reasonably believes to be violating any applicable law, rules, or regulations, NICE may share your information with law enforcement and other competent authorities and with any third party that may consult NICE or assist in in connection with any such breach as may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing; including without limitation, in order to contain, remediate, prevent, investigate any such breach, and/or establish or exercise any of NICE\u2019s legal rights.</p>\n<p>Further, your personal data may be disclosed:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>As permitted or required by, or in response to lawful requests by applicable local law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies, or agencies with responsibility to oversee and enforce national security;</li>\n    <li>In any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and NICE, or between you and other users or third parties;</li>\n    <li>In any case where NICE may reasonably believe that sharing information is necessary to prevent serious damage to you or to your property or to any third party or their property;</li>\n    <li>If NICE organizes the operation of the Website within a different framework, or through another legal structure or entity, or if NICE is acquired by, or merged with another entity, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions of this Privacy Notice; and</li>\n    <li>NICE may share personal data with its Affiliates, for the purpose of assisting in the processing activities detailed herein or if such Affiliate is the best suited to handle your enquiry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NICE may share personal data with its service providers for the purpose of helping NICE execute certain tasks outsourced to them, or providing capabilities NICE requires.

We may do this where data is accessed/processed:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>by NICE Affiliates for operational, administrative and compliance purposes;</li>\n    <li>by NICE and its Affiliates\u2019 sales, business partners, operational or customer support teams in our various locations, as detailed in the Website; and</li>\n    <li>By our service providers, for the purposes we specified above under the section \"Sharing of Information with Third Parties\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By consenting to the collection and use of your personal information, you agree to your personal information being transferred and stored in this manner and for the specified purposes.</p>\n<p>The safeguards we deploy for performing such transfers across boundaries:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Adequacy. Any transfers to NICE Affiliates may be made on the basis of an adequacy decision made by the European Commission.</li>\n    <li>Model Clauses. With some of our processors, we use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission that are binding standards of processing of personal data committed to contractually by third parties processing information for us and on our behalf</li>\n    <li>Consent. In the absence of an adequacy decision or Model Clauses, and in the absence of any other right to transfer your data, your consent shall serve as the basis for such transfer.

The transfer will be to such third parties as described under \u201cSharing of Information with Third Parties\u201d.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h4>\n<p>NICE does not knowingly collect personal data from minors who are under the age of 16 through the Website without appropriate consent. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information via the Website without his/her consent, then he or she should contact NICE at the information described below. If we become aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>\n<h4>COOKIES</h4>\n<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your web browser that allows NICE or a third party (such as NICE third party service providers) to recognize you. Cookies might be used for the following purposes: (1) to enable certain functions; (2) to provide analytics; (3) to store your preferences; and (4) to enable ad delivery and behavioral advertising. Cookies can either be session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years. Cookies placed by the website you're visiting are sometimes called \"first party cookies,\" while cookies placed by other companies are sometimes called \"third party cookies.\"</p>\n<p>When you access and/or use the Website, NICE or a third party may place a number of cookies in your browser. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used.</p>\n<p>Each cookie serves one of four different purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>: These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</li>\n    <li><strong>Targeting Cookies</strong>: These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</li>\n    <li><strong>Performance Cookies</strong>: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.</li>\n    <li><strong>Functional Cookies</strong>: These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use additional technologies to help track user activities and preferences. For example, we use web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs). Web beacons are tiny graphics (about the size of period) with a unique identifier that are embedded invisibly on web pages or emails. They are used to track user activities and communicate with cookies. You cannot opt out of web beacons used in webpages, but you can limit their use by opting out of the cookies they interact with. You can opt out of web beacons used in emails by setting your email client to render emails in text mode only.</p>\n<p>Finally, we may set cookies that monitor links to our website that we send to you (if you have consented to receiving emails from us). These cookies are used to track visitors to our Website sourced from these emails. To avoid these type of cookies, please follow the explanation below on how to change your browser cookies settings.</p>\n<p>In addition we may use a tracking technology (pixels) in emails to understand how often our emails are opened and clicked on by our customers. If you do not wish this tracking to be effected, please change your email software or service (such as outlook, Gmail etc.) settings to not automatically download images (to the extent it is not already your default) In some instances, depending on your email or browser settings, cookies in an email may be automatically accepted (for example, when you have added an email address to your address book or safe senders list). Please refer to your email browser or device instructions for more information on this.</p>\n<p>Third party companies like analytics companies and ad networks generally use cookies to collect user information on an anonymous basis. They may use that information to build a profile of your activities on the Website and other websites that you have visited.</p>\n<p>If you do not like the idea of cookies or certain types of cookies, you can change your browser's settings to delete cookies that have already been set and to not accept new cookies. To learn more about how to do this, visit the help pages of your browser. Some useful information can also be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.allaboutcookies.org/\">https://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>&nbsp;Please note, however, that if you delete cookies or do not accept them, you might not be able to use all of the features we offer, you may not be able to store your preferences, and some of our pages might not display properly.</p>\n<p>More detailed information on cookies we use can be found in our Cookie Policy here: <a href=\"https://www.nice.com/company/legal/cookie-policy\">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>\n<h4>Interest Based Advertising</h4>\n<p>We engage in interest-based advertising in order to deliver advertisements and personalized content that we believe will be of interest to you. Advertisements, emails, and other messages may be delivered to you by NICE or its service providers based on your online or mobile behavior, your search activity, your geographic location or other information that is collected by us or obtained by such third parties using cookies (such as your clicking on our paid ads in Google or other social networks).</p>\n<p>In addition, we and our business partners use third parties to establish deterministic or probabilistic connections among devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for advertising analytics and reporting purposes. This means that information about your use of websites or applications on your current device may be combined with information from your other devices. We also may share this information and other inferences with third parties to allow them to target advertising, personalize content, or analyze behavior. This allows, for example, advertisements you see on your tablet to be based on activities you engaged in on your smartphone. These business partners may share and combine information from cookies with identifiers (such as device IDs assigned by Google or Apple) and IP addresses to make connections among related devices. This also allows for a more personalized experience across the Website.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about our Cookie policy, you may contact us via the contact information listed below.</p>\n<h4>CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION NOTICE</h4>\n<p>Certain of NICE's subsidiaries offer communications-related services, including local and long distance service, as well as the provisioning of telecommunications equipment. From time to time, those subsidiaries may need or desire to share your Customer Proprietary Network Information (\"CPNI\") with other NICE affiliates and/or with third parties involved in assisting with the offering of the services described above and also to enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to you. Just as the applicable NICE subsidiary(s) is required to protect your CPNI, so too will these third parties. Under no circumstances will NICE and/or any NICE subsidiary sell your CPNI to third parties, or otherwise disclose your CPNI to third parties for marketing purposes in contravention of this Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>By way of clarification, CPNI comprises of: (i) information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and extent to which you use our communication-related services; and (ii) information contained on your telephone bill concerning the services you receive. That information, when matched to your name, address, and telephone number, is known as CPNI. Examples of CPNI include information typically available from telephone-related details on your monthly bill, technical information, type of service, current telephone charges, long distance and local service billing records, directory assistance charges, usage data, and calling patterns. CPNI does not include subscriber list information, aggregate information, or data not specific to a single customer.</p>\n<p>You may examine and correct, if necessary, the CPNI-related personally identifiable information regarding you that is collected and maintained by us in our regular business records. In most cases, this information consists solely of billing and account information. We will correct our records if you make a reasonable showing that any such information we have collected about you is inaccurate. If you wish to examine these records, please contact us in writing at the address listed below. Please give us a reasonable period of time to locate and, if necessary, prepare the information for your review. You will only be permitted to examine records that contain personally identifiable information about your account and no other account.</p>\n<p>You have the right to restrict our use of your CPNI by sending a request in writing to:&nbsp;<em>inContact</em>, Inc., Kimm Partridge, Assistant Corporate Secretary, 75 West Towne Ridge Parkway, Tower 1, Sandy, UT 84070. If you deny or restrict your approval for any one of our subsidiaries to use your CPNI, you will suffer no effect, now or in the future, on the services provided to you other than our ability to provide you with, or otherwise notify you of, the customized offerings and enhanced services described above.</p>\n<p>In the event NICE and/or a NICE subsidiary experiences a privacy breach and CPNI is disclosed to unauthorized persons, federal rules require that such breach be reported to law enforcement. Please be aware that we are not permitted by law to inform customers of the CPNI breach until at least seven (7) days after notification has been sent to law enforcement (which period may be extended if law enforcement shall advise us to withhold such information for a longer period of time).</p>\n<h4>SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES</h4>\n<p>The Website includes social media plugins, including links to Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the plugin to function properly. Social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>\n<h4>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</h4>\n<p>This Website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by NICE. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Website.</p>\n<h4>DATA SECURITY</h4>\n<p>NICE implements data security systems and procedures to secure the information stored on NICE computer servers.

Cookies might be used for the following purposes: (1) to enable certain functions; (2) to provide analytics; (3) to store your preferences; and (4) to enable ad delivery and behavioral advertising. Cookies can either be session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years. Cookies placed by the website you're visiting are sometimes called \"first party cookies,\" while cookies placed by other companies are sometimes called \"third party cookies.\"\nWhen you access and/or use the Website, NICE or a third party may place a number of cookies in your browser. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used.\nEach cookie serves one of four different purposes:\n\n    Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.\n    Targeting Cookies: These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.\n    Performance Cookies: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.\n    Functional Cookies: These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.\n\nWe use additional technologies to help track user activities and preferences. For example, we use web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs). Web beacons are tiny graphics (about the size of period) with a unique identifier that are embedded invisibly on web pages or emails. They are used to track user activities and communicate with cookies. You cannot opt out of web beacons used in webpages, but you can limit their use by opting out of the cookies they interact with. You can opt out of web beacons used in emails by setting your email client to render emails in text mode only.\nFinally, we may set cookies that monitor links to our website that we send to you (if you have consented to receiving emails from us). These cookies are used to track visitors to our Website sourced from these emails. To avoid these type of cookies, please follow the explanation below on how to change your browser cookies settings.\nIn addition we may use a tracking technology (pixels) in emails to understand how often our emails are opened and clicked on by our customers. If you do not wish this tracking to be effected, please change your email software or service (such as outlook, Gmail etc.) settings to not automatically download images (to the extent it is not already your default) In some instances, depending on your email or browser settings, cookies in an email may be automatically accepted (for example, when you have added an email address to your address book or safe senders list). Please refer to your email browser or device instructions for more information on this.\nThird party companies like analytics companies and ad networks generally use cookies to collect user information on an anonymous basis. They may use that information to build a profile of your activities on the Website and other websites that you have visited.\nIf you do not like the idea of cookies or certain types of cookies, you can change your browser's settings to delete cookies that have already been set and to not accept new cookies.

Advertisements, emails, and other messages may be delivered to you by NICE or its service providers based on your online or mobile behavior, your search activity, your geographic location or other information that is collected by us or obtained by such third parties using cookies (such as your clicking on our paid ads in Google or other social networks).\nIn addition, we and our business partners use third parties to establish deterministic or probabilistic connections among devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for advertising analytics and reporting purposes. This means that information about your use of websites or applications on your current device may be combined with information from your other devices. We also may share this information and other inferences with third parties to allow them to target advertising, personalize content, or analyze behavior. This allows, for example, advertisements you see on your tablet to be based on activities you engaged in on your smartphone. These business partners may share and combine information from cookies with identifiers (such as device IDs assigned by Google or Apple) and IP addresses to make connections among related devices. This also allows for a more personalized experience across the Website.\nIf you have any questions about our Cookie policy, you may contact us via the contact information listed below.\nCUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION NOTICE\nCertain of NICE's subsidiaries offer communications-related services, including local and long distance service, as well as the provisioning of telecommunications equipment. From time to time, those subsidiaries may need or desire to share your Customer Proprietary Network Information (\"CPNI\") with other NICE affiliates and/or with third parties involved in assisting with the offering of the services described above and also to enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to you. Just as the applicable NICE subsidiary(s) is required to protect your CPNI, so too will these third parties. Under no circumstances will NICE and/or any NICE subsidiary sell your CPNI to third parties, or otherwise disclose your CPNI to third parties for marketing purposes in contravention of this Privacy Notice.\nBy way of clarification, CPNI comprises of: (i) information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and extent to which you use our communication-related services; and (ii) information contained on your telephone bill concerning the services you receive. That information, when matched to your name, address, and telephone number, is known as CPNI. Examples of CPNI include information typically available from telephone-related details on your monthly bill, technical information, type of service, current telephone charges, long distance and local service billing records, directory assistance charges, usage data, and calling patterns. CPNI does not include subscriber list information, aggregate information, or data not specific to a single customer.\nYou may examine and correct, if necessary, the CPNI-related personally identifiable information regarding you that is collected and maintained by us in our regular business records. In most cases, this information consists solely of billing and account information. We will correct our records if you make a reasonable showing that any such information we have collected about you is inaccurate. If you wish to examine these records, please contact us in writing at the address listed below. Please give us a reasonable period of time to locate and, if necessary, prepare the information for your review. You will only be permitted to examine records that contain personally identifiable information about your account and no other account.\nYou have the right to restrict our use of your CPNI by sending a request in writing to:\u00a0inContact, Inc., Kimm Partridge, Assistant Corporate Secretary, 75 West Towne Ridge Parkway, Tower 1, Sandy, UT 84070. If you deny or restrict your approval for any one of our subsidiaries to use your CPNI, you will suffer no effect, now or in the future, on the services provided to you other than our ability to provide you with, or otherwise notify you of, the customized offerings and enhanced services described above.\nIn the event NICE and/or a NICE subsidiary experiences a privacy breach and CPNI is disclosed to unauthorized persons, federal rules require that such breach be reported to law enforcement. Please be aware that we are not permitted by law to inform customers of the CPNI breach until at least seven (7) days after notification has been sent to law enforcement (which period may be extended if law enforcement shall advise us to withhold such information for a longer period of time).\nSOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES\nThe Website includes social media plugins, including links to Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.
