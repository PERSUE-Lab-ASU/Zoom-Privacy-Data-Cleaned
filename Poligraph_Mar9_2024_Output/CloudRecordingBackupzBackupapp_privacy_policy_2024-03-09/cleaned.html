<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Welcome to zBackup.app’s simple &amp; transparent privacy policy. We try to keep the legalese to a minimum and give you a product that’s easy to use and transparent about your privacy. When we integrate with outside apps like Zoom and our cloud storage providers, we limit the amount of data we ask for as much as we can while still providing you a quality service.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Who is zBackup.app</strong><br>zBackup.app has issued this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to describe how we handle the personal information that we come across during your usage of our application. The “Primary Function” of zBackup.app is to upload cloud recordings of Zoom meetings to various cloud storage providers. zBackup.app is a service provided by Ahead Real Estate, LLC, a limited liability company based in Plano, TX (referred to as “zBackup.app”, “we”, “us” within this Policy). Most of the information we collect is for us to be able to provide this service to you.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Types of information collected &amp; how it’s used</strong><br>We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, protect, and promote our service. Your data may be transferred between our servers and vendors to carry out these tasks.
<p><br><em>Personal Information.</em>&nbsp;This includes your name, email address, usernames, phone number, company name, billing address, time zone, and IP address/geolocation.<br><br><em>Virtual Meeting Recording Files.</em>&nbsp;This includes audio recordings, video recordings, and meeting metadata. To complete zBackup.app’s Primary Function, we will often temporarily download parts or whole files from your Zoom account to upload that data to other providers. To increase the efficiency and privacy of our application, we will have the cloud storage providers directly download the information from Zoom’s servers where possible. If the cloud provider requires us to download this information, we will only store your meeting recordings on our server as long as the files are needed to upload to the cloud provider. <br><br><em>Metadata.</em> To help us provide and support our customers, we will store metadata of your actions and automatic backups on our service. Some of this data may be displayed to you on your account dashboard and some of this data may be accessible only to zBackup.app staff members.<br><br><em>Analytics Information.</em> We use various service providers, like Google Analytics and Zoho Analytics, to understand how you engage with our website and service. If you don’t want Google Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the ‘Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On’, provided by Google. <br><br><em>Retargeting Information.</em>&nbsp;We may also use service providers to collect retargeting information to bring our users advertising based on their engagement with our website and service.<br><br><em>Subscription &amp; Payment information.</em>&nbsp;When you make a purchase with us, our service provider(s) will collect your payment information for the purpose of billing you over the course of your subscription.</p>
<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Who your information is shared with</strong><br><br><em>Cloud Storage Providers.</em> To carry out our Primary Function, we will need to share your Virtual Meeting Recording Files and Metadata with your selected Cloud Storage Providers.<br><br><em>Analytics Service Providers.</em> See the “Analytics Information” section of section 2.<br><br><em>Marketing &amp; Email Service Providers.</em>&nbsp;To inform you of your usage of the service and to promote the service to you, we will need to share your contact information with our marketing &amp; email service providers.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>How long we keep your data for</strong><p>With the exception of Virtual Meeting Recording Files which are deleted after they are successfully backed up to your cloud storage provider, we will securely store the rest of the data listed in section 2. Once you uninstall our service either by sending a request to our contact listed in section 8 or by uninstalling our app through the Zoom Marketplace, we will delete any metadata we have on file for your account. For accounting and future business development purposes, we will need to hold on to some of your payment information &amp; history and some of your personal information, where allowable by Zoom policies.</p>
