		<div class="content content-page clearfix"><p>When accessing our Website, EthosCE will learn certain information about you during your visit. By using the Site, you expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our <a title="Terms of Use" href="https://www.ethosce.com/terms-of-service/">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, we use the following terms to describe different types of visitors to our Site. Our clients are called “Subscribers” and our clients’ users are called “End-users”. We use the word “staff” to describe persons to whom Subscribers give “staff” access on the Site. Together with registered users of interactive areas of the Site, these people are collectively described in this Privacy Policy as “Users” of our Site.</p>
<h3>Use of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We use personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to provide to you the services offered by the Site; troubleshoot problems; deliver information to you that, in some cases, is relevant to your interests, such as new courses; customize your experience; enforce our <a title="Terms of Use" href="https://www.ethosce.com/terms-of-service/" target="_self">Terms of Use</a>; provide you with system or administrative messages. On occasion we use email addresses or other contact information to contact our Users to ask them for their input on our services.</p>
<p>We may also use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize the Site’s content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site.</p>
<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, and efficient experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>
<p>If you visit our site to read or download information on our pages, we collect and store only the following information about you:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the domain from which you access the Internet</li>
<li>The date and time you access our site</li>
<li>The Internet address of the website you used to link directly to our site.</li>
<li>The IP address you access our site from</li>
<li>Browser environment details, such as internet speed connection and screen resolution</li>
</ol>
<p>EthosCE will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us, nor will such information be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection.</p>
<p>Once you become a User, we require you to provide various contact and identity information, and other personal information as indicated on the relevant forms on the Site (which vary, depending on what kind of User you are), and you are no longer anonymous to us. Where possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.</p>
<p>EthosCE may use software programs to create summary statistics, such as Google Analytics, which are used for such purposes as assessing the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.</p>
<p>“Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session, to offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie and to allow us to provide information that is targeted to your interests.</p>
<p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, EthosCE uses software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
<p>We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your explicit consent. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services:</p>
<p><em>Subscribers and End-Users, Etc.</em> In the normal operation of the Site, End-User information is disclosed to the applicable Subscriber, for example contact information used in the recording of training completions. In general, information you enter on the Site is available to the other persons – whether they are End-Users, Subscribers, staff members or others – to whom you give access to your account or to whom you give access to the information through the normal operation of the Site.</p>
<p><em>Forum</em>. If you post on a public forum, your username and other information you include is displayed in your postings or comments, and is therefore available to the public. All of your activities in the public areas of the forum will be identifiable to your User ID, and other people can see your published content. Some forums are private to individual Subscribers’ accounts, and postings or comments of these forums are available only to those members of the private forum.</p>
<p><em>Legal Requests; Emergencies.</em> We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries and demands for information that are made under force of law. Therefore, we may provide personal information to law enforcement agencies in what we believe to be emergency situations, we may provide personal information where required by court order, legal process or lawful authority, and we may provide it to our legal counsel in connection with the foregoing.</p>
<h3>Your Use of Other Persons’ Information</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the services provided by the Site, the Site allows you in certain circumstances to give other Users limited access to the personal information of other persons. For example, if you are a Subscriber, you may use the Site to give access to an End-User to view training completion data of your End-Users. By entering into our <a title="Terms of Use" href="https://www.ethosce.com/terms-of-service/">Terms of Use</a>, you agree that, with respect to the personal information of other persons that you collect, use and disclose on the Site, you have all necessary consents and rights to collect, use and disclose that information as described in this Privacy Policy from time to time, and you agree that the indemnity you give to us in the <a title="Terms of Use" href="https://www.ethosce.com/terms-of-service/">Terms of Use</a> applies to any non-compliance by you with the foregoing.</p>
