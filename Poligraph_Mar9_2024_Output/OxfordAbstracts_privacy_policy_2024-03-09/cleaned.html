<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">How is processing your personal data lawful:</span></strong></p>
<p>We are allowed to process your personal data based on the following legal bases for the purposes explained in this Website Privacy Notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> - We are permitted to process your personal data if it is based on our ‘legitimate interests’ i.e. we have good, sensible, practical reasons for processing your personal data which is in our interests. To do so, we have considered the impact on your interests and rights, and have placed appropriate safeguards to ensure that the intrusion on your privacy is reduced as much as possible. The table in the previous section "<strong>Why do we process your personal data</strong>" explains the personal data processed on this basis.</p>
<p>You can object to processing that we carry out on the grounds of legitimate interests. See the section headed "Your Rights" to find out how.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – It is necessary for our performance of the contract you have agreed to enter with us. If you do not provide your personal data to us, we will not be able to carry out our obligations under the terms of your contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consent</strong> - Sometimes we want to use your personal data in a way that is entirely optional for you, such as when you give consent for us to place cookies on your device. On these occasions, we will ask for your consent to use your information. You can withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Retention and deletion of your personal data:</span></strong></p>
<p>We only retain your personal data for as long as we need it by law. We will store conference data for at least a year after the conference start date unless the customer deletes the event. This allows customers to look back at a previous year's conference when setting up a new conference. The following categories of personal data will be kept for the following periods and will be securely deleted/ destroyed after the expiry of the retention period:</p>
