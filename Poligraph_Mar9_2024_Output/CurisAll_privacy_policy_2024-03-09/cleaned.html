          <h3 class="serviceSubTitle">Security Measures</h3>
          <p class="serviceContent">
            We have implemented technical, physical, and organizational security
            measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of
            your health information and other sensitive data collected and
            stored through our teleconsulting services. These safeguards may
            include, but are not limited to, encryption of data in transit,
            access controls, and regular security audits. However, we cannot and
            do not guarantee that these measures will prevent every unauthorized
            attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite
            our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can
            be completely secure.
