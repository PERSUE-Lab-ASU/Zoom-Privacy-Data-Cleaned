For the purposes of this section, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device, and does not include information that is publicly available, or deidentified or aggregated information.</p> <p>You have the right to request that we disclose to you the Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell, including (i) the categories of, and specific pieces of, Personal Information that we have collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected; (iii) the business or commercial purpose for collecting such Personal Information; (iv) if any, the categories of third parties with whom we have shared such Personal Information; and (v) if any, the categories of your personal information that we have disclosed to third parties for a business purpose.&nbsp;</p> <p>You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information about you which we have collected from you, unless that information is necessary for us to retain pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.105(d), which for instance, allows retention of such information for completing the transaction for which the Personal Information was collected, detecting security incidents, or complying with a legal obligation.&nbsp;</p> <p>To submit requests for information or deletion pursuant to this section, you may reach out via email at the address noted in the “CONTACT US” section above. Please note that we can only delete information which is stored on our systems. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request for information or deletion. We cannot respond to a request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. We will make a determination regarding whether the information provided by you for verification purposes is reliable, and if not, we may request additional information, or may decline to provide certain information to you. Without limiting the verification procedures available to us:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>We may request certain data points from you to compare those with the information we have on file for you. We may require at least two data points which match our records for information deemed less sensitive. If you are requesting certain types of sensitive information, we may require at least three data points from you, which must match our records, or we may require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the personal information you request is about you.&nbsp;</li> <li>If a person or entity purporting to be your authorized agent reaches out on your behalf to obtain information or request deletion of information pursuant to this Policy, and unless that agent has provided a power of attorney to us, we may require that you verify your identify directly with us, or directly confirm to us that you have provided the agent permission to submit such request on your behalf.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>For a disclosure request made pursuant to this section, we will endeavor to disclose and deliver requested information to you, without charge, within 45 days of receiving your request, and if an extension of such timeframe is reasonably necessary, we will provide you notice of such extension. The information provided will cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. We are not required to provide such information more than twice in a 12-month period. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. We are not required to, and may not in some cases, retain Personal Information about you if you have submitted the Personal Information in a one-time transaction.&nbsp;</p> <p>We will not discriminate against you in violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.125 for exercising your rights set forth in this section of the Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>We do not have knowledge that we have sold the Personal Information of any consumers under 16 years of age.&nbsp;</p> <p>We do not sell, or disclose, release, transfer, or otherwise communicate your Personal Information to any third-party for monetary or other valuable consideration, except to the extent that sharing Reports with Hosts (as further described in the Terms of Service) could be considered engaging in such actions. If you do not desire for us to share Reports with Hosts, which could include your Personal Information as described in the Policy, your option to opt-out of such sharing of data is (i) cease use of the Application, and (ii) submit a request for deletion pursuant to this section.&nbsp;</p> <p>We have collected, and disclosed for the business purposes set forth herein, certain information from the following categories of Personal Information as set forth in Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140(o)(1), from our users in the past 12 months: (i) identifiers, such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, or other similar identifiers; (ii) commercial information, including records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies; (iii) internet or other similar network activity information, including, but not limited to, as browsing history, search history, information on a consumer's interaction with a website, application, or advertisement; (iv) geolocation data; (v) sensory data; and vi) inferences drawn from other personal information to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.&nbsp;</p> <p>We obtain the categories of personal information listed above from the categories of sources set forth above in this Policy. We collect the categories of personal information for the business purposes set forth above in this Policy.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>ADDITIONAL STATE-SPECIFIC RIGHTS&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Additional US states, such as Virginia, Connecticut, Utah, and Colorado, may provide their residents with rights to:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Confirm whether we process their personal information;</li> <li>Access and delete certain personal information;</li> <li>Data portability;</li> <li>Opt-out of personal data processing for targeted advertising and sales;</li> <li>Correct inaccuracies in their personal information, taking into account the information's nature processing purpose; and&nbsp;</li> <li>Opt-out of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects.</li> </ul> <p>Further, Nevada provides its residents with limited rights to opt-out of certain sales of personal information.&nbsp;</p> <p>To exercise any of these rights please use the contact information contained in the “CONTACT US” or “CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT” sections of this Policy.
