<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class="bold">Effective Date: August 13, 2021</p>
<p>Drift.com, Inc. (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the https://www.drift.com, http://app.drift.com, and http://dev.drift.com website and the Drift mobile application (collectively, the “Services”). This page informs you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information which personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) when you use our Services. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”). We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Services. By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<div class="bold">Information Collection and Use; Personal Information</div>
<p>We may ask you to provide us, or third parties may provide us, with certain Personal Information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, postal address, email address, and employer. We collect Personal Information for the purpose of providing the Services, identifying and communicating with you about the Services, responding to your requests/inquiries, servicing your purchase orders, improving our Services, and communicating with you about our Services, discounts, and promotions.</p>
<div class="bold">How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</div>
<p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p>
<div class="bold">Account Information</div>
<p>We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, it will be anonymized and used to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p>
<div class="bold">Managed Accounts</div>
<p>If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by your employer under our agreement with your employer as required by the administrator of your account. If your account is deactivated, your information and conversations you may have had and actions you may have taken on the Services will remain in order to allow your team members to make full use of the Services.</p>
<div class="bold">Marketing Information</div>
<p>If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services. Every marketing email we send will provide you with the option to opt out of receiving future emails.</p>
<div class="bold">Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information</div>
<p>We acknowledge individuals’ rights to access their personal information. You may access, update, correct or have removed from our systems and records the Personal Information you provided to us by emailing a request to privacy@drift.com or contacting us by telephone or postal mail as further specified in the How to Contact Us clause of this Privacy Policy. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your information.</p>
<div class="bold">Information Collected Directly from You</div>
<p>We collect information about you when you provide it to us and automatically when you use the Services.</p>
<div class="bold">Log Data</div>
<p>We collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our website or use our Services (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Services that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics. In addition, we use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Services’ functionality. These third-party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information. When you access the Services by or through a mobile device, we collect certain information automatically, including the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, and your general location information as described further below.</p>
<div class="bold">Location Information</div>
<p>We use and store information about your general location. We use this information to provide features of our Services and to improve and customize our Services.</p>
<div class="bold">Cookies</div>
<p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and transferred to your device. We use cookies to collect information in order to improve our Services. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. The “Help” feature on most browsers provide information on how to accept cookies, disable cookies or to notify you when receiving a new cookie. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some features of our Services and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
<div class="bold">Do Not Track Disclosure</div>
<p>We do not support Do Not Track (“DNT”). Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the “Preferences” or “Settings” page of your web browser.</p>
<div class="bold">Information Collected from Other Sources</div>
<p>We will enrich your Personal Information with additional Personal Information received from publicly accessible sources. We may also receive your information from services you integrate with Drift, from other users of Drift, or from our partners.</p>
<div class="bold">Integrations</div>
<p>You may enhance the Services by enabling Drift integrations with third-party products. If you provide third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) will be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Further, Drift software may request permissions to take actions on your behalf using your third-party account credentials. For example, if you choose to integrate Drift Services with your Google Mail inbox, Drift software will request authority to read incoming messages and send emails on your behalf.</p>
<div class="bold">Other Users of the Services</div>
<p>Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they use the Services. For example, we receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services.</p>
<div class="bold">Partners</div>
<p>We work with partners who may market, sell, or support our Services. These partners may provide us your Personal Information so that we can contact you. We also may receive your Personal Information from advertising, market research, or data enrichment partners with whom we engage to identify prospective customers.</p>
<div class="bold">Google User Data</div>
<p>Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, if you provide the Drift Application with access to the following types of your Google data, the Application’s use of that data will be subject to these additional restrictions:</p>
<p>The Application will only use access to read, write, modify or control Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide a web email client that allows users to compose, send, read, and process emails and will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets.</p>
<p>The Application will not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements.</p>
<p>The Application will not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law, or for the App’s internal operations and even only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized.</p>
<p>Drift’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google Accounts will adhere to<a class="c-link" href="https://click.api.driftqa.com/click/88641b31-689b-4c93-a438-253fb87c97f7?u=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__developers.google.com_terms_api-2Dservices-2Duser-2Ddata-2Dpolicy-23additional-5Frequirements-5Ffor-5Fspecific-5Fapi-5Fscopes%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3DP1Dci1wcau9HQxzdgeFbIQ%26r%3D5gJ0cWKwJIv_xQJvnJsrYMo3izIB7KDkpjK3fjPmJlA%26m%3DSHh75-xzSZcjVG9o-kAYhCh_Z5IpNHMnvTAw3YcEFNU%26s%3DLzb13Rz5A7GP6pUl2WzxFi55VKYUyUGbXWBRr47y9bw%26e%3D&amp;h=e0260e2c830ee0daa2a7a363c22da859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://click.api.driftqa.com/click/88641b31-689b-4c93-a438-253fb87c97f7?u=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__developers.google.com_terms_api-2Dservices-2Duser-2Ddata-2Dpolicy-23additional-5Frequirements-5Ffor-5Fspecific-5Fapi-5Fscopes%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3DP1Dci1wcau9HQxzdgeFbIQ%26r%3D5gJ0cWKwJIv_xQJvnJsrYMo3izIB7KDkpjK3fjPmJlA%26m%3DSHh75-xzSZcjVG9o-kAYhCh_Z5IpNHMnvTAw3YcEFNU%26s%3DLzb13Rz5A7GP6pUl2WzxFi55VKYUyUGbXWBRr47y9bw%26e%3D&amp;h=e0260e2c830ee0daa2a7a363c22da859" data-sk="tooltip_parent">&nbsp;Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such legal and contractual obligations between us and such service providers, we remain potentially liable for any misuse of your Personal Information. We will only disclose Personal Information when we are required to do so in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<div class="bold">Communications; Your Options</div>
<p>We may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.

<div class="bold">Security of Personal Information</div>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected from you.</p>
<div class="bold">International Transfer of Personal Information</div>
