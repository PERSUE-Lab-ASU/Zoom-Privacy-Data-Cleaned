All uses of “Loop” herein refer to the legal business entity Curious Labs, Inc.</p><p>‍</p><p>The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours!—is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>What we collect and why</strong>‍</h5><p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Identity &amp; access</strong></h5><p>When you sign up for a Curious Labs, Inc. product (e.g. Loop), we ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and maybe a company name. That’s so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you product updates and other essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you use our products and to make improvements. With your consent, we may send you our newsletter and other updates. We may also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products.</p><p>‍</p><p>We’ll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Billing information</strong></h5><p>If you sign up for a paid Loop product, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address. Credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn’t hit Loop servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address so we can charge you for service, calculate any sales tax due, send you invoices, and detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We occasionally use aggregate billing information to guide our marketing efforts.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Product interactions</strong></h5><p>We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in your Loop product accounts. This is so you can use our products as intended, for example, to receive an email form Loop. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we’ll delete the content within 60 days.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Geolocation data</strong></h5><p>For most of our products, we log the full IP address used to sign up a product account and retain that for use in mitigating future spammy signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Website interactions</strong></h5><p>We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they took to load, and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are signed in, these web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer active. The web analytics we use are described further in the Advertising and Cookies section.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Anti-bot assessments</strong></h5><p>We may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> across our applications to mitigate brute force logins and as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential-stuffing attacks and spam. When you log into your Loop account and when you fill in certain forms in Loop, if we implement the CAPTCHA service, it will evaluate various information (e.g., IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program instead of a human. The CAPTCHA service then provides Loop with the spam score results; we do not have access to the evaluated information.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Voluntary correspondence</strong></h5><p>When you email Loop with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.</p><p>‍</p><p>We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so with your express consent.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>When we access or share your information</strong></h5><p>To provide products or services you’ve requested. We use some third-party subprocessors to help run our applications and provide the Services to you. We also use third-party processors for other business functions, such as managing newsletter subscriptions, sending customer surveys, and providing our company storefront.</p><p>‍</p><p>We may share your information at your direction if you integrate a third-party service into your use of our products. For example, we may allow you, at your option, to connect your Gmail account to your Loop account so that you can use Gmail to receive and respond to Loop services. Email that you receive from Loop will be stored by both Loop and Google and will be available to you from your Gmail account.</p><p>‍</p><p>No human looks at your content except for limited purposes with your express permission, for example, if an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases, and when they happen, we look for root-cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them recurring. We may also access your data if required in order to respond to legal processes (see “When required under applicable law” below).</p><p>‍</p><p>To exclude you from seeing our ads. Where permissible by law and if you have a Loop account, we may share a one-way hash of your email address with ad companies to exclude you from seeing our ads.</p><p>‍</p><p>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission. If, at any point, we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.</p><p>‍</p><p>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses. Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us, and we do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will take action as necessary, including notifying appropriate authorities where warranted.</p><p>When required under applicable law.</p><p>‍</p><p>Curious Labs, Inc. is a U.S. company, and all data infrastructure is located in the U.S.</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to share data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is Curious Labs’s policy to notify affected users before we share data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.</li><li>Preservation requests. Similarly, Curious Labs’s policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not share preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period.</li><li>If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we will share only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.<br>‍</li></ul><p>Finally, if Curious Labs, Inc. is acquired by or merges with another company, we’ll notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.<br><br></p><h5><strong>Your rights with respect to your information</strong></h5><p>At Curious Labs, Inc., we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Right to Know. You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li><li>Right of Access. This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security, and processing of that information.</li><li>Right to Correction. You have the right to request correction of your personal information.</li><li>Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”. This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Loop services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li><li>Right to Complain. You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.</li><li>Right to Restrict Processing. This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of the sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)</li><li>Right to Object. You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li><li>Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making. You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for the performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li><li>Right to Non-Discrimination. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more about local privacy laws.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Location of site and data</strong></h5><p>Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, the UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using our websites or Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer_component"><div class="padding-global"><div class="container-large"><div class="padding-vertical padding-small"><div class="w-layout-grid footer_top-wrapper"><a href="/" id="w-node-f60d6ff6-76ec-9d5d-62bc-25db0278722e-02787228" class="footer_logo-link w-nav-brand"></a><div class="w-layout-grid footer_link-list"><a href="/pricing" class="footer_link">Pricing</a><a href="/about" class="footer_link">About</a><a href="/loop-developers" class="footer_link">Developers</a><a href="/contact" class="footer_link">Contact</a></div></div><div class="padding-top-new"><div class="w-layout-grid footer_bottom-wrapper"><div id="w-node-f60d6ff6-76ec-9d5d-62bc-25db0278723c-02787228" class="footer_credit-text">© <span class="current-year">2025</span> Curious Labs, Inc All rights reserved.</div><a id="w-node-a602f100-24ee-f56c-1315-5cb521323fce-02787228" href="/privacy-policy" aria-current="page" class="footer-link">Privacy Policy</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
