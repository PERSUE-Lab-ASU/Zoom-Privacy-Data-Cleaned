When Edit on the Spot collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. \u25e6 Personal Data that We Collect from Third Parties: We collect personal data from third parties, such as lead generation firms. \u25e6 By voluntarily providing us with personal data, you acknowledge that you have read this Privacy Policy and understand that such personal data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Edit on the Spot and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States, which may not offer the same level of protection as the country in which you are located. \u25e6 Automatically Collected Data: When you interact with Edit on the Spot through the Site or Services, we receive and store certain automatically collected information collected passively using various technologies. Edit on the Spot may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Edit on the Spot affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors\u2019 Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Edit on the Spot often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us.

Edit on the Spot may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. \u25e6 In operating our Site, we may also use a technology called \u201ccookies.\u201d A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site.

You can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the \u201cHelp\u201d section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer ; Microsoft Edge ; Google Chrome ;Mozilla Firefox ; or Apple Safari).

To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.

We also may allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks, servers and platform) to serve tailored advertising to you on the Services or on other websites or in other mobile applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device you use to access the Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy does not govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed by such third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer or mobile browser to deliver tailored advertising (i.e., not just for the Services), you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out Link and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s WebChoices Tool to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising.

To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing Controller Data are as follows: \u25e6 Legitimate interests: In most cases, we handle Controller Data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities such as the following in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals: \u25aa Protecting our Services, business, personnel and property \u25aa Customer service \u25aa Marketing \u25aa Analyzing and improving our business \u25aa Managing legal issues \u25aa We may also process Controller Data for the same legitimate interests of our customers and business partners \u25aa To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our processing of Controller Data is to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at customers\u2019 request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them. \u25aa Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle Controller Data on the basis of consent. Where legally required (e.g., for the use of fingerprints for security purposes in certain jurisdictions), this is explicit consent. \u25aa Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose Controller Data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations. \u25e6 Edit on the Spot is not in the business of selling Controller Data.

In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, including during negotiations of such an event, Controller Data may be part of the transferred assets. \u25aa Related Companies: We may also share Controller Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. \u25aa Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Edit on the Spot, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions.
