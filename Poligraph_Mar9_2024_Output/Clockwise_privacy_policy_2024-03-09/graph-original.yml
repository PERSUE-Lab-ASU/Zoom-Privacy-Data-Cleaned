  - For this section, we use the terms "Personal Data" and "processing" as they are
    defined in the GDPR, but "Personal Data" generally means information that can
    be used to individually identify a person, and "processing" generally covers actions
    that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage
    and disclosure.
  - From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal
    obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other
    data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
  - In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information,
    which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the
    nature of your request.

    may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete
    a transaction or other action you have requested.'

    the minimal extent necessary to facilitate the functioning of the Services, specifically
