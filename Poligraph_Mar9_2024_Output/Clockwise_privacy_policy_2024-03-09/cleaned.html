To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.

While Privacy Shield is no longer a valid lawful basis on which Clockwise may rely to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR), Clockwise continues to comply with both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union (the “EU”), the United Kingdom (the “UK”) and Switzerland, respectively, to the United States.
