If you enter into a licensing agreement with UiPath, we will process your business contact details for contract performance. We will process this data in accordance with the GDPR and in order to meet our contractual and legal requirements. Contract performance includes providing you the license codes, account activations, contracts and business accounts management, support and communications related to the products and services you are using. UiPath processes your contact details in order to send you the latest updates, releases and news about our products and events or to ask for your feedback using UiPath products, as a based on your contractual relation with UiPath or with your consent. What personal data is received by UiPath when you use our cloud products? If you use personal data with UiPath cloud products, they will be processing data on your behalf and UiPath will be considered a data processor under the GDPR. This means that you are the controller and thus, you are in control of the personal data you use with our products. When you use the UiPath Cloud Platform, UiPath may have access to user data and data available in Orchestrator - a core component of the UiPath Cloud Platform that allows customers to manage their fleet of robots from a central control panel. All customer data in each data store that makes up our service stack will be encrypted. UiPath processes two categories of data when using UiPath Cloud Platform: (1) customer data and (2) system-generated logs. Customer data includes user-identifiable transactional and interactional data that we need to operate the service and manage your contract with UiPath. System-generated logs include service usage data that may be aggregated and contain pieces of customer data. From a GDPR standpoint, UiPath is considered a data processor in relation to system-generated logs if they contain personal data. UiPath honors all obligations of a data processor by providing customers with full control over their data, in accordance with the product architecture. UiPath is transparent about the sub-processors it uses and about the locations where your data is primarily stored when using cloud products. More details can be found\u00a0here. More details about the terms which govern the use of the UiPath Cloud Platform can be found\u00a0here. The Data Processing Agreement which applies when personal data is used with the Platform can be found\u00a0here. Please be mindful of the fact that if you use UiPath products in Private Preview or Trial you may have restrictions on using personal data or sensitive data with the products. Does UiPath have access to your production data? UiPath maintains strict control over who has access to production environment and customer data. Access is only granted at the level of least privilege and only after proper justifications are provided and verified. If a team member needs access to resolve an urgent issue or deploy a configuration change, they must apply for \"just in time\" access to the production service. Access is revoked as soon as the situation is resolved. Access requests and approvals are tracked. If the username and password for one of our developers or operation staff were to be stolen, data is still protected because we use two-factor authentication for all production system access. How does UiPath ensure safe personal data transfers between its affiliates or with its sub-processors when cloud products are used? To ensure that personal data is protected in accordance with GDPR when shared with its affiliates or with its sub-processors, UiPath uses the following personal data transfer mechanisms: \u25e6 Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the decisions of the European Commission \u25e6 Privacy Shield certification mechanism, for persona data transfers from the EU or Switzerland to the USA \u25e6 (*)UiPath Inc. is an active participant of the Privacy Shield Framework. For more information please click\u00a0here. (*)When GDPR became effective, UiPath has signed Standard Contractual Clauses with its affiliates and has imposed GDPR policies and standards, globally, among its entities. Privacy Shield was used by UiPath as an additional transfer mechanism and not as the primary transfer mechanism, which is why the recent ruling of the European Court of Justice does not affect the protection or transfer of personal data of European customers. With its sub-processors, UiPath has concluded data processing agreements in accordance with GDPR, ensuring that any transfer mechanism used will be in compliance with the European legislation. Will UiPath have access to the personal data you use with the on-premise software? Generally, our products can be used both on-premise or in the cloud, depending on your specific needs and applicable laws.

What personal data does UiPath process for support purposes? If you have any troubleshooting issues, please reach out\u00a0here for support.

respects core data protection principles and laws.

Processing of personal data UiPath sub-processors must comply with the instructions provided by UiPath as a controller and with the EU data protection legislation. The purpose and the categories of personal data processed are expressly defined and specified in the data processing agreements together with the processing activities.

Personal data trans-border transfers Personal data trans-border transfers outside the UiPath group of companies are allowed only if an adequate level of personal data protection is ensured, either by signing standard contractual clauses, by having in place binding corporate rules, codes of conduct or certification mechanisms. Audits and inspections UiPath has the right to conduct inspections and audits at the premises of the sub-processors for the part of the business involving UiPath data. Alternatively, UiPath sub-processors will present recognized audit reports conducted by professional third parties, such as ISO 27001 or SOC II reports, at least once a year.
