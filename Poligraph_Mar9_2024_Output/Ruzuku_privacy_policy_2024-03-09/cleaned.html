        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Ruzuku we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
        <ul class="square-bullets">
          <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
          <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
          <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please <a href="/support">contact support</a>.</p>
        <p>Ruzuku, Inc. (“Ruzuku”) operates <a href="http://ruzuku.com">ruzuku.com</a>. It is Ruzuku’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
        <h2 class="small-head">Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>Like most website operators, Ruzuku collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ruzuku’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ruzuku’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Ruzuku may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate (e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.)</p>
        <p>Ruzuku also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Ruzuku only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
        <h2 class="small-head">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Certain visitors to Ruzuku’s websites choose to interact with Ruzuku in ways that require Ruzuku to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ruzuku gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a course hosted on ruzuku.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Ruzuku — by purchasing access to the ruzuku.com service, for example — are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Ruzuku collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Ruzuku. Ruzuku does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

        <h2 class="small-head">Aggregated Statistics</h2>
        <p>Ruzuku may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Ruzuku may monitor the most popular courses on the ruzuku.com site. Ruzuku may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Ruzuku does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

        <h2 class="small-head">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Ruzuku discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Ruzuku’s behalf or to provide services available at Ruzuku’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Ruzuku’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Ruzuku will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Ruzuku discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Ruzuku believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ruzuku, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Ruzuku website and have supplied your email address, Ruzuku may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Ruzuku and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Ruzuku takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
        <h2 class="small-head">Cookies</h2>
        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Ruzuku uses cookies to help Ruzuku identify and track visitors, their usage of Ruzuku website, and their website access preferences. Ruzuku visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Ruzuku’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Ruzuku’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
        <h2 class="small-head">Business Transfers</h2>
        <p>If Ruzuku, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Ruzuku goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Ruzuku may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
        <h2 class="small-head">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Ruzuku may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Ruzuku’s sole discretion. Ruzuku encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
