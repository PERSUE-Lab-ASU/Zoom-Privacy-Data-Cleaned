Like most website operators, We gather from Users of the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the User\u2019sInternet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible for Us to determine from an IP address a User\u2019s Internet service provider and the geographic location of the User\u2019spoint of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. We analyze Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Users of the Website to help Us better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, We are able to better design the Website to improve Your experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use.  From time to time, We may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</p>\n<h3>Web Cookies</h3>\n<p>A \u201cWeb Cookie\u201d is a string of information which assigns You a unique identification that a website stores on a User\u2019s computer, and that the User\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of services You have used, to record registration information regarding Your login name and password, to record Your User preferences, and to keep You logged into the Website. Company also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that Users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve Users\u2019 experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Users of the Website, Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. GReminders USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p> \n<h3>Web Beacons</h3>\n<p>A \u201cWeb Beacon\u201d is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually invisible to the User and allows website operators to check whether a User has viewed a particular web page or an email.  We may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count Users who have visited particular pages or viewed emails. Web Beacons are not used to access Users\u2019 Personally-Identifying Information. They are a technique We may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides.  You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying Your browser setting to notify You each time a Web Cookie is tendered, permitting You to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Analytics</h3>\n<p>We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on Your past activity on the Website, including Google Analytics for Display Advertising. The information collected may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. If You do not want any information to be collected and used by Google Analytics, You can install an opt-out in Your web browser (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and/or opt out from Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network by using Google\u2019s Ads Settings (www.google.com/settings/ads).</p>\n<h3>Aggregated and Non-Personally-Identifying Information</h3>\n<p>We may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information We collect under any of the above circumstances.  \nWe may also share it with third parties and Our affiliate companies to develop and deliver targeted information on the \nWebsite and on websites of third parties.  \nWe may combine Non-Personally Identifying Information We collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying Information collected from other sources.  \nWe also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. \nFor example, We may tell Our investors the number of visitors to the Website and the most popular features or services accessed.  \nThis information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and may be used to develop website content and services that \nWe hope You and other Users will find of interest and to target content.</p> \n<h3>SOCIAL MEDIA&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect You to a social network if You click on the respective link. However, when You click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d button, Twitter\u2019s \u201ctweet\u201d button or the Google+, that particular social network\u2019s plugin will be activated and Your browser will directly connect to that provider\u2019s servers. If You do not use these buttons, none of Your data will be sent to the respective social network\u2019s plugin provider. So for example, when You click on the Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d button on the Website, Facebook will receive Your IP address, the browser version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device You have used to access the Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks and are not within Our control.</p>\n<p><strong>For Authorized Users of GReminders SaaS Services Only:</strong>  We may provide You the option to connect Your account on the Website to Your account on some social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling certain features on the Services.  We may collect the Personally-Identifying Information You have made publicly available on the social networking site, such as Your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friends network, age range, locale, friend list and any other information You have made public. By connecting Your account on the Website to Your account on any social networking site, You consent to the continuous release of information about You to Us. We will not send any of Your account information to the connected social networking site. Each social network may further allow You to set privacy controls around Your information on their system, and Our collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the available features and shared information are subject to change without notice to You</p>\n\n<p>After You login to the Services, Authorized Users may be allowed to login to and access their personal social networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, Google+, etc.) (\u201cThird Party Account\u201d) and import Data into their GReminders account. &nbsp;By logging in to third Party sites from the Services, Users acknowledge they are entitled to disclose their Third-Party Account login information to Us and/or grant Us access to such Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein) without breach by You of any of the terms and conditions that govern Your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Us to pay any fees or making Us subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-Party service providers. &nbsp;By granting Us access to any Third-Party Accounts, You understand that We may access, make available and store (if applicable) any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Services that User has provided to and stored in such Third-Party Account so that it is available on and through the Website and Services. &nbsp;Depending on the Third-Party Accounts, Users choose, and subject to the privacy settings that a User has set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information contained in such Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through a User\u2019s account on the Website and Services.  Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Service Provider\u2019s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-Party service provider, then data from such Third-Party Account may no longer be available on and through the Services. &nbsp;Users have the ability to disable the connection between Your User account and the Third-Party Accounts at any time. PLEASE NOTE THAT USER\u2019SRELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTED THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY THE USER AGREEMENT(S), TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND PRIVACY POLICY ESTABLISHED BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS. &nbsp;We make no effort to review any data received from such Third-Party Accounts for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or noninfringement, and We are not responsible for any data contained in or received from such Third-Party Accounts.</p>\n<h3>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h3>\n<h3>Website Registration</h3>\n<p>Website registration applies both to Authorized Users that login to access the GReminders SaaS Services as well as Visitors that register to receive newsletters, public updates and information, to complete a \u201cContact Us\u201d request or for other purposes.  As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person.  We may collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website Users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected is information provided by users themselves when (1) registering on Our Website, (2) logging in to access the Services, (3) logging in with social network credentials, (4) participating in polls, contests, surveys or other features of Our Website, (5) or responding to offer or advertisements, (6) communicating with us, (7) creating a public profile or (8) signing up to receive newsletters.

We also may request information about Your interests and activities, Your gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic or relevant information as determined by Company from time to time. Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide Company with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a User\u2019s refusal to do so may prevent the User from using certain Website features.</p>\n<p>BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS \u201cCOLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\u201d SECTION.</p>\n<h3>Online Postings</h3>\n<p>Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users may be disclosed as a matter of course as a result of Your use of the Website.  We may provide areas on the Website where You can post reviews and other information relating to Your activities on the Website.  Such postings are governed by Our&nbsp;Terms of Use.  In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of Your posting.  Also, whenever You voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.  For example, if You post Your email address, You may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads Your posting or what other Users may do with the information You voluntarily post, so We encourage You to exercise discretion and caution with respect to Your personal information. USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM THEIR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.</p>\n<h3>Company Communications</h3>\n<p>We may occasionally use Your name and email address to send You notifications regarding new products, services or information made available by Company that We think You may find valuable.  We may also send You service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.  Generally, You may opt out of such emails at the time of registration or through Your account settings, though We reserve the right to send You notices about Your account, such as service announcements and administrative messages, even if You opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>\n<h3>Company Disclosures</h3>\n<p>Company will disclose Personally-Identifying Information under the following circumstances:</p> \n<ul>\n<li>\nBy Law or to Protect Rights. When We believe disclosure is appropriate, \nWe may disclose Personally-Identifying Information in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent or \ntake other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, \nproperty or safety of Company, Our Users, Our employees or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; \nto enforce Our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies, in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, \na court order or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise Our legal rights; \nto defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, We may raise or waive any legal objection \nor right available to Us.\n</li>\n\n<li>Third-Party Service Providers. \nWe do not share personal data with any third-party partners.  \nWe do not and will not sell, rent, share or disclose your personal information without first \nreceiving your permission or as permitted in this Privacy Policy.\nWe will only share your information with third parties in accordance with your instructions or as necessary to provide you \nwith a specific service or otherwise in accordance with applicable privacy legislation. \n</li>\n\n<li>Business Transfers; Bankruptcy. Company reserves the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Company\u2019s assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally-Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if You are given notice of that new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it. Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changing Personally-Identifying Information; Account Termination </h3>\n<p>You may at any time review or change Your Personally-Identifying Information by going to Your account settings \n(if applicable) or contacting Us using the contact information below. &nbsp;Upon Your request, We will deactivate or \ndelete Your account and contact information from Our active databases. Such information will be deactivated or \ndeleted as soon as practicable based on Your account activity and accordance with Our deactivation policy and applicable law. \nTo make this request, either go to Your account settings (if applicable) or contact Us as provided below. We will retain in Our files some Personally-Identifying Information to prevent fraud, to troubleshoot problems, to assist with any investigations, to enforce Our Terms of Use and to comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, You should not expect that all Your Personally-Identifying Information will be completely removed from Our databases in response to Your requests.  Additionally, We keep a history of changed information to investigate suspected fraud with Your account.</p>\n<h3>General Use</h3>\n<p>Company uses the Personally-Identifying Information in the file We maintain about You, and other information We obtain from Your current and past activities on the Website (1) to deliver the products and services that You have requested; (2) to manage Your account and provide You with customer support; (3) to communicate with You by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to You either from us, Our affiliate companies or other third parties; (4) to develop and display content and advertising tailored to Your interests on the Website and other sites; (5) to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems; (6) to measure consumer interest in Our services; (7) to inform You of updates; (8) to customize Your experience; (9) to detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; (10) to enforce Our Terms of Use; and (11) to do as otherwise described to You at the time of collection.

We may compare and review Your Personally-Identifying Information for accuracy and to detect errors and omissions. We may use financial information or payment method to process payment for any purchases made on the Website, enroll You in the discount, rebate, and other programs in which You elect to participate, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions and otherwise as needed to manage Our business.</p>\n<h3>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES GENERALLY</h3>\n<p>Company contractually prohibits its contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers from disclosing Personally-Identifying Information received from Company, other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that Users provide directly to those third parties, or that those third parties collect for themselves. These third parties include advertisers, providers of games, utilities, widgets and a variety of other third-party applications accessible through the Website. Company neither owns nor controls the third-party websites and applications accessible through the Website. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third party, or using a third-party application, whether by means of a link on the Website, directly through the Website or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any such third party, users should inform themselves of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website or application, and should take those steps necessary to, in those users\u2019 discretion, protect their privacy.</p>\n\n<h3>Data Retention</h3>\n<p>How long we retain your Personal Data depends on the type of data and the purpose for which we process the data. \nWe will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice \nunless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Your Rights to Your Information</h3>\n<p>We strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location.

This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>\n<li>Right to Non-Discrimination. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights.

(\"GReminders\") (\"us\", \"we\", or \"our\") operates the greminders.com website (hereinafter referred to as the \"Service\").\n\nUnderstanding Our Website\nGReminders is a website that provides both general information about Our company, products and services as well as a portal through which the Authorized Users of Subscribers access the GReminders SaaS Services. \u00a0\nAbout this Privacy Policy\nOur Privacy Policy tells you (i) what information We may collect from you, (ii) how We may use and/or share that information, and (iii) how you can limit Our collection, use and sharing of Your information. \u00a0The term \u201cinformation\u201d includes both \u201cNon-Personal Information\u201d (NPI) and \u201cPersonally Identifiable Information\u201d (PII), as are more fully defined and described in this Privacy Policy.  \nThis Privacy Policy applies to (i) individuals who visit Our Website (\u201cVisitors\u201d), (ii) individuals who login to use the Services as Authorized Users of Subscribers (\u201cAuthorized Users\u201d), and (iii) individuals that signup for our newsletter, request information, order products or services, fill out a \u201cContact Us\u201d request or otherwise provide us with information (\u201cRegistered Users\u201d).

We limit the collection of personal information to those items necessary to fulfill the purposes identified below. If We use Your information in a manner different than the purpose for which it is collected, then We will ask You for your consent prior to such use. This Privacy Policy is designed to inform You about the types of information that We may gather about or collect from You in connection with Your use of the Website and Services. It also is intended to explain the conditions under which We use and disclose that information, and Your rights in relation to that information. Changes to this Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document. Each time You use the Website, however, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, each time You use the Website You should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the beginning of this document) and review any changes since the last time You used the Website.\nThe Website is hosted in the United States of America and is subject to U.S. state and federal law. If You are accessing Our Website from other jurisdictions, please be advised that You are transferring Your personal information to us in the United States, and by using Our Website, You consent to that transfer and use of Your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You also agree to abide by the applicable laws of applicable states and U.S. federal law concerning Your use of the Website and Your agreements with us. Any persons accessing Our Website from any jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing the use of the Internet, including personal data collection, use and disclosure, different from those of the jurisdictions mentioned above may only use the Website in a manner lawful in their jurisdiction. If Your use of the Website would be unlawful in Your jurisdiction, please do not use the Website. \n\nGATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\nVisitors and Users of the Website Generally\n\u201cNon-Personally-Identifying Information\u201d is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person. \u201cPersonally-Identifying Information,\u201d by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person. Like most website operators, We gather from Users of the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the User\u2019sInternet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible for Us to determine from an IP address a User\u2019s Internet service provider and the geographic location of the User\u2019spoint of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. We analyze Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Users of the Website to help Us better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, We are able to better design the Website to improve Your experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use.  From time to time, We may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.\nWeb Cookies\nA \u201cWeb Cookie\u201d is a string of information which assigns You a unique identification that a website stores on a User\u2019s computer, and that the User\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of services You have used, to record registration information regarding Your login name and password, to record Your User preferences, and to keep You logged into the Website. Company also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that Users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve Users\u2019 experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Users of the Website, Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. GReminders USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY. \nWeb Beacons\nA \u201cWeb Beacon\u201d is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually invisible to the User and allows website operators to check whether a User has viewed a particular web page or an email.  We may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count Users who have visited particular pages or viewed emails. Web Beacons are not used to access Users\u2019 Personally-Identifying Information. They are a technique We may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides.  You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying Your browser setting to notify You each time a Web Cookie is tendered, permitting You to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis. \u00a0\nAnalytics\nWe may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on Your past activity on the Website, including Google Analytics for Display Advertising. The information collected may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. If You do not want any information to be collected and used by Google Analytics, You can install an opt-out in Your web browser (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and/or opt out from Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network by using Google\u2019s Ads Settings (www.google.com/settings/ads).\nAggregated and Non-Personally-Identifying Information\nWe may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information We collect under any of the above circumstances.  \nWe may also share it with third parties and Our affiliate companies to develop and deliver targeted information on the \nWebsite and on websites of third parties.  \nWe may combine Non-Personally Identifying Information We collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying Information collected from other sources.  \nWe also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. \nFor example, We may tell Our investors the number of visitors to the Website and the most popular features or services accessed.  \nThis information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and may be used to develop website content and services that \nWe hope You and other Users will find of interest and to target content. \nSOCIAL MEDIA\u00a0\nWe may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect You to a social network if You click on the respective link. However, when You click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d button, Twitter\u2019s \u201ctweet\u201d button or the Google+, that particular social network\u2019s plugin will be activated and Your browser will directly connect to that provider\u2019s servers. If You do not use these buttons, none of Your data will be sent to the respective social network\u2019s plugin provider. So for example, when You click on the Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d button on the Website, Facebook will receive Your IP address, the browser version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device You have used to access the Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks and are not within Our control.\nFor Authorized Users of GReminders SaaS Services Only:  We may provide You the option to connect Your account on the Website to Your account on some social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling certain features on the Services.  We may collect the Personally-Identifying Information You have made publicly available on the social networking site, such as Your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friends network, age range, locale, friend list and any other information You have made public. By connecting Your account on the Website to Your account on any social networking site, You consent to the continuous release of information about You to Us. We will not send any of Your account information to the connected social networking site. Each social network may further allow You to set privacy controls around Your information on their system, and Our collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the available features and shared information are subject to change without notice to You\n\nAfter You login to the Services, Authorized Users may be allowed to login to and access their personal social networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, Google+, etc.) (\u201cThird Party Account\u201d) and import Data into their GReminders account. \u00a0By logging in to third Party sites from the Services, Users acknowledge they are entitled to disclose their Third-Party Account login information to Us and/or grant Us access to such Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein) without breach by You of any of the terms and conditions that govern Your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Us to pay any fees or making Us subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-Party service providers. \u00a0By granting Us access to any Third-Party Accounts, You understand that We may access, make available and store (if applicable) any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Services that User has provided to and stored in such Third-Party Account so that it is available on and through the Website and Services. \u00a0Depending on the Third-Party Accounts, Users choose, and subject to the privacy settings that a User has set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information contained in such Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through a User\u2019s account on the Website and Services.  Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Service Provider\u2019s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-Party service provider, then data from such Third-Party Account may no longer be available on and through the Services. \u00a0Users have the ability to disable the connection between Your User account and the Third-Party Accounts at any time. PLEASE NOTE THAT USER\u2019SRELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTED THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY THE USER AGREEMENT(S), TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND PRIVACY POLICY ESTABLISHED BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS. \u00a0We make no effort to review any data received from such Third-Party Accounts for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or noninfringement, and We are not responsible for any data contained in or received from such Third-Party Accounts.\nCOLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\nWebsite Registration\nWebsite registration applies both to Authorized Users that login to access the GReminders SaaS Services as well as Visitors that register to receive newsletters, public updates and information, to complete a \u201cContact Us\u201d request or for other purposes.  As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person.  We may collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website Users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected is information provided by users themselves when (1) registering on Our Website, (2) logging in to access the Services, (3) logging in with social network credentials, (4) participating in polls, contests, surveys or other features of Our Website, (5) or responding to offer or advertisements, (6) communicating with us, (7) creating a public profile or (8) signing up to receive newsletters. That information may include each User\u2019s name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if You transact business with us, financial information such as Your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about Your interests and activities, Your gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic or relevant information as determined by Company from time to time. Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide Company with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a User\u2019s refusal to do so may prevent the User from using certain Website features.\nBY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS \u201cCOLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\u201d SECTION.\nOnline Postings\nCertain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users may be disclosed as a matter of course as a result of Your use of the Website.  We may provide areas on the Website where You can post reviews and other information relating to Your activities on the Website.  Such postings are governed by Our\u00a0Terms of Use.  In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of Your posting.  Also, whenever You voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.  For example, if You post Your email address, You may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads Your posting or what other Users may do with the information You voluntarily post, so We encourage You to exercise discretion and caution with respect to Your personal information. USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM THEIR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.\nCompany Communications\nWe may occasionally use Your name and email address to send You notifications regarding new products, services or information made available by Company that We think You may find valuable.  We may also send You service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.  Generally, You may opt out of such emails at the time of registration or through Your account settings, though We reserve the right to send You notices about Your account, such as service announcements and administrative messages, even if You opt out of all voluntary email notifications.\nCompany Disclosures\nCompany will disclose Personally-Identifying Information under the following circumstances: \n\n\nBy Law or to Protect Rights. When We believe disclosure is appropriate, \nWe may disclose Personally-Identifying Information in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent or \ntake other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, \nproperty or safety of Company, Our Users, Our employees or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; \nto enforce Our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies, in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, \na court order or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise Our legal rights; \nto defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, We may raise or waive any legal objection \nor right available to Us.\n\n\nThird-Party Service Providers. \nWe do not share personal data with any third-party partners.  \nWe do not and will not sell, rent, share or disclose your personal information without first \nreceiving your permission or as permitted in this Privacy Policy.\nWe will only share your information with third parties in accordance with your instructions or as necessary to provide you \nwith a specific service or otherwise in accordance with applicable privacy legislation. \n\n\nBusiness Transfers; Bankruptcy. Company reserves the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Company\u2019s assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally-Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if You are given notice of that new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it. Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization. \n\nChanging Personally-Identifying Information; Account Termination \nYou may at any time review or change Your Personally-Identifying Information by going to Your account settings \n(if applicable) or contacting Us using the contact information below. \u00a0Upon Your request, We will deactivate or \ndelete Your account and contact information from Our active databases. Such information will be deactivated or \ndeleted as soon as practicable based on Your account activity and accordance with Our deactivation policy and applicable law. \nTo make this request, either go to Your account settings (if applicable) or contact Us as provided below. We will retain in Our files some Personally-Identifying Information to prevent fraud, to troubleshoot problems, to assist with any investigations, to enforce Our Terms of Use and to comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, You should not expect that all Your Personally-Identifying Information will be completely removed from Our databases in response to Your requests.  Additionally, We keep a history of changed information to investigate suspected fraud with Your account.\nGeneral Use\nCompany uses the Personally-Identifying Information in the file We maintain about You, and other information We obtain from Your current and past activities on the Website (1) to deliver the products and services that You have requested; (2) to manage Your account and provide You with customer support; (3) to communicate with You by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to You either from us, Our affiliate companies or other third parties; (4) to develop and display content and advertising tailored to Your interests on the Website and other sites; (5) to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems; (6) to measure consumer interest in Our services; (7) to inform You of updates; (8) to customize Your experience; (9) to detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; (10) to enforce Our Terms of Use; and (11) to do as otherwise described to You at the time of collection. At times, We may look across multiple users to identify problems. In particular, We may examine Your Personally-Identifying Information to identify users using multiple user IDs or aliases. We may compare and review Your Personally-Identifying Information for accuracy and to detect errors and omissions. We may use financial information or payment method to process payment for any purchases made on the Website, enroll You in the discount, rebate, and other programs in which You elect to participate, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions and otherwise as needed to manage Our business.\nCOLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES GENERALLY\nCompany contractually prohibits its contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers from disclosing Personally-Identifying Information received from Company, other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that Users provide directly to those third parties, or that those third parties collect for themselves. These third parties include advertisers, providers of games, utilities, widgets and a variety of other third-party applications accessible through the Website. Company neither owns nor controls the third-party websites and applications accessible through the Website. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third party, or using a third-party application, whether by means of a link on the Website, directly through the Website or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any such third party, users should inform themselves of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website or application, and should take those steps necessary to, in those users\u2019 discretion, protect their privacy.\n\nData Retention\nHow long we retain your Personal Data depends on the type of data and the purpose for which we process the data. \nWe will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice \nunless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\n\n\nYour Rights to Your Information\nWe strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:\n\nRight to Know. You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.\nRight of Access. This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.\nRight to Correction. You have the right to request correction of your personal information.\nRight to Erasure / \u201cTo Be Forgotten\u201d. This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. \nFulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using GReminders because the application may then no longer work. \nIn such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.\n\nRight to Complain. You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.\nRight to Restrict Processing. This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information.\nRight to Object. You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.\nRight to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making. You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.\nRight to Non-Discrimination. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.\nMany of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information.\n\nIf you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at privacy@greminders.com or at Kaiser Ridge, Inc., 360 E. 1st Street #506 Tustin, CA 92780. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.\n\nIf you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more about local privacy laws.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Resident Rights\n\nIf you are a California resident, you have the rights outlined in this section. If you are a California resident \nand there are conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Policy, the portion that is more \nprotective of your Personal Data shall control. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the \nfollowing applies to you, please email privacy@greminders.com.\n\nAccess. You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of \nyour Personal Data over the past 12 months. We will provide you with the following information:\n\n\nThe categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you;\nThe categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected;\nThe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data;\nThe specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.\nIf we have disclosed your Personal Data for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of \nPersonal Data shared with each category of third-party recipient.\n\n\n\nDeletion. You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected from you. \nUnder the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), this right is subject to certain exceptions. For example, we may \nneed to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. \nIf your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.\n\nExercising Your Rights. To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request that (1) \nprovides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data \n(this will require you to send an email from the account in question or login credentials), and (2) describes your request \nin sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Each request that meets both criteria will be \nconsidered a \u201cValid Request.\u201d We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data \nprovided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.\n\nWe will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request \nunless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
