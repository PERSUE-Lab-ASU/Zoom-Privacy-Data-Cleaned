<p>Proofpoint understands the importance of safeguarding your privacy and we take this responsibility very seriously. The Proofpoint Privacy Statement (“<strong>Privacy Statement</strong>”) is designed to help you understand how we process personal information, and how you can access and control this data.</p>

<p>Proofpoint, Inc., headquartered at 925 W. Maude Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, (<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d0a73c10-77b4-4e60-aecd-2492b21ce9a2" href="/leadership-team" title="Leadership Team">https://www.proofpoint.com/us/leadership-team</a>) is responsible for the management of the personal data within its organization. Proofpoint offers a range of products and services to customers throughout the world and includes those offered by any of its affiliated companies (collectively "<strong>Proofpoint</strong>") through its applicable websites (the "<strong>Site</strong>") or in connection with our products and/or services (the "<strong>Proofpoint Service</strong>").</p>

<p>Proofpoint is a cybersecurity company specializing in helping organizations protect against advanced cybersecurity threats and compliance risks. The Proofpoint Service resides between the email service provider and customer, acting as a filter to stop harmful content from reaching its customers. Proofpoint is not an email service provider, meaning that we do not provide customers with the ability to send or receive emails. We are also not a domain host and do not manage domain names.</p>

<p>Access to the Proofpoint Service is provided to you through an organization with which you are affiliated, such as an employer or school. That organization controls your use of the Proofpoint Service and the data that is transferred to Proofpoint for processing. You may also provide personal information to Proofpoint through use of the Site, blogs, marketing requests, and use of the Proofpoint Service.</p>

<p><strong>By proceeding to use the Site and/or the Proofpoint Service, you consent that we may process the personal data that we collect from you in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</strong></p>

<p>Information We Collect and How We Use It Proofpoint uses the data we collect through manual and automated methods to protect you and your organization against advanced email threats. This includes:</p>

<ul><li>Providing our products, services, and customer support,</li>
	<li>Improving and enhancing our products and services, including our threat-detection capabilities,</li>
	<li>Continuing to develop threat intelligence to safeguard your organization’s important information,</li>
	<li>Advertising and marketing to you and/or representatives at your organization, and</li>
	<li>Delivering the superior privacy and cybersecurity protection that you expect of Proofpoint.</li>

We also collect your public IP address when you visit the Site. We may use your public IP address in order to determine whether certain requests are fraudulent or frivolous and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (usually the domain name of your ISP or employer).

Log Data does not include Personal Network Information. Although such Personal Network Information may be used to administer and maintain the Site, it is not shared with any third parties, except as described below in the sections titled "Service Providers," "Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement" and "Business Transfers." We will use Log Data for any purpose.</p>

<p>We may also use your Log Data and Personal Network Information to: (i) administer our Site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical, and survey purposes; (ii) improve our Site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your device; (iii) allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so; and/or (iv) as part of our efforts to keep our Site safe and secure.</p>
