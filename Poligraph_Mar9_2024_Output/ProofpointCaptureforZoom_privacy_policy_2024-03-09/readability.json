The Proofpoint Privacy Statement (\u201cPrivacy Statement\u201d) is designed to help you understand how we process personal information, and how you can access and control this data.\n\nProofpoint, Inc., headquartered at 925 W. Maude Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, (https://www.proofpoint.com/us/leadership-team) is responsible for the management of the personal data within its organization. Proofpoint offers a range of products and services to customers throughout the world and includes those offered by any of its affiliated companies (collectively \"Proofpoint\") through its applicable websites (the \"Site\") or in connection with our products and/or services (the \"Proofpoint Service\").\n\nProofpoint is a cybersecurity company specializing in helping organizations protect against advanced cybersecurity threats and compliance risks. The Proofpoint Service resides between the email service provider and customer, acting as a filter to stop harmful content from reaching its customers. Proofpoint is not an email service provider, meaning that we do not provide customers with the ability to send or receive emails. We are also not a domain host and do not manage domain names.\n\nAccess to the Proofpoint Service is provided to you through an organization with which you are affiliated, such as an employer or school. That organization controls your use of the Proofpoint Service and the data that is transferred to Proofpoint for processing. You may also provide personal information to Proofpoint through use of the Site, blogs, marketing requests, and use of the Proofpoint Service.\n\nBy proceeding to use the Site and/or the Proofpoint Service, you consent that we may process the personal data that we collect from you in accordance with this Privacy Statement.\n\nInformation We Collect and How We Use It Proofpoint uses the data we collect through manual and automated methods to protect you and your organization against advanced email threats. This includes:\n\nProviding our products, services, and customer support,\n\tImproving and enhancing our products and services, including our threat-detection capabilities,\n\tContinuing to develop threat intelligence to safeguard your organization\u2019s important information,\n\tAdvertising and marketing to you and/or representatives at your organization, and\n\tDelivering the superior privacy and cybersecurity protection that you expect of Proofpoint.\n\n\n          \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n      \n                    \n\n      Contact Information You Give Us\n  \n          \n        \n        You may directly give us your contact information in the following ways: (i) if you sign up for a free trial via www.proofpoint.com, (ii) sign up for offers on the Site, (iii) sign up for newsletters, (iv) download white papers from the Site, (v) respond to a promotion offered by a Proofpoint partner, or (vi) send us an email. Such contact information includes first and last name, title, company name, industry type, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and company size (\"Contact Information\"). We may also collect information about your mailbox size, which will allow us to classify your company by size and provide customized information about implementing the Proofpoint Service within your organization. We may combine your Contact Information with information collected from others to improve the quality and value of the Proofpoint Service and to analyze and understand how our Site is used.\n\nWe will use the Contact Information provided to us directly by you to: (i) carry out our obligations arising from any contracts between you and Proofpoint; (ii) provide you with the services, products, and/or information which you have requested from us; (iii) notify you about changes to our services or products; and (iv) ensure that content from our Site is presented in the most effective manner for you and your device.

If you no longer consent to our use of your Contact Information to send you our newsletter or other communications, please send us an email stating so to privacy@proofpoint.com or follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.\n\nWe will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Proofpoint Service. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you the Proofpoint Service, please contact us at privacy@proofpoint.com. Please note that we may still retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\n\n\n          \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n      \n                    \n\n      Personal Data You Post On Our Blog\n  \n          \n        If you use the blog on this Site, you should be aware that any personal data you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these blogs, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

We also collect your public IP address when you visit the Site. We may use your public IP address in order to determine whether certain requests are fraudulent or frivolous and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (usually the domain name of your ISP or employer). Because you may be visiting the Site from your personal residence (for example, because you are telecommuting), your IP address and any associated domain name are treated as \"Personal Network Information\" instead of Contact Information.
