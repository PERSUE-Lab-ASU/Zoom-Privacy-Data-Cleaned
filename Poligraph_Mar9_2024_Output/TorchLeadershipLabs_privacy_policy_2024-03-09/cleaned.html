Redfish Labs, Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Redfish Labs, Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework Principles, EU, UK and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct or amend incomplete or incorrect information, or delete the personal information that has been processed in violation of the principles. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete data transferred to the United States under DPF, should direct their query to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@torch.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy@torch.io</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned further in this policy, we do not rent, sell, or permit personal data to be used for reasons other than those for which it was originally provided.&nbsp; If this practice should change in the future, we will update this policy accordingly and l provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@torch.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy@torch.io</a>.</p>
<p>In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>Torch’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the DPF Principles. In particular, Torch remains responsible and liable under the Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Torch proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
