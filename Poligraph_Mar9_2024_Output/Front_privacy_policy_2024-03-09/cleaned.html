If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Special categories of data.</strong> We do not collect sensitive data defined by the GDPR as “special categories of data” (i.e., personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership; genetic or biometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person; data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation) and ask that you do not provide us with any such information. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Your rights.</strong> European data protection laws give individuals in Europe the following rights regarding their personal data:</p>
<ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Right of access.</strong> You can ask us to provide you with information about our processing of your personal data and give you access to your personal data.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Right to rectification.</strong> If the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to request to have it rectified.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Right to erasure.</strong> You can ask us to delete or remove your personal data where there is no lawful reason for us continuing to store or process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Right to restrict processing.</strong> You can ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data if you want us to establish the information’s accuracy; where our use of the information proves to be unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or if you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Right to object.</strong> You can object to our processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) to do so and you believe it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Right to data portability.</strong> You have the right, in certain circumstances, to ask us to provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. </p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Right to withdraw consent at any time.</strong> Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.</p></li></ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Exercising those rights.</strong> Please note that some of these rights may be limited where we have an overriding interest or legal obligation to continue to process the personal data or where certain exemptions apply. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To exercise any of these rights, please <a href="#12_how_to_contact_us">contact us</a>. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. </p>
