<h3 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h3>
<p>Range provides services to help companies work better together. Our main service
is a team coordination tool for building high-performance cultures. We are a
Delaware C-Corp, located in San Francisco.</p>
<h3 id="what-this-policy-applies-to">What this policy applies to</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the range.co website, including all subdomains
and subpages, (collectively referred to as the “Site”), and also applies to all
software and services that we offer, including data that we collect through our
integration with other third-party applications, web applications, products,
content, and other online or offline services that we offer when you register
for a Range account (collectively referred to as the “Services”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any website, product or service of any
third-party company even if the third-party website links to (or is linked from)
our Site. Range does not operate or control those websites, products or
services. Please always review the privacy practices of a company before
deciding whether to provide any information.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding processing done by our customers:</strong> Our Services allow our customers
to collect and understand data generated by the members of their organization,
which may include the personal data of their employees, volunteers, contractors,
or other individuals (“Customer Data”). Our customers’ respective privacy
policies govern their collection and use of Customer Data. If you work for an
organization that uses our Services and have questions or requests relating to
how they collect, use, process, share, disclose, store or delete Customer Data,
you should consult with your organization’s representative.</p>
<h3 id="data-we-collect">Data we collect</h3>
<h4 id="data-collected-automatically">Data collected automatically</h4>
<p>We collect information about your device, such as your Internet Protocol (IP)
address, MAC address, cookie identifiers, general location information (derived
from IP address), information about your mobile device (such as device or
browser type, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers),
and Internet service provider. We may also automatically collect information
regarding your use of our Services, such as pages that you visit before, during
and after using our Services, information about the links you click, the types
of content you interact with, the frequency and duration of your activities, and
other information about how you use our Services.</p>
<h4 id="site-visitors">Site visitors</h4>
<p>To simply browse our Site, you are not required to provide any Personal
Information. However, we may gather information from cookies and similar
technologies for the purposes of monitoring and improving our Site and
understanding and improving the effectiveness of our advertising. See our
<a href="#cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> below for more information.</p>
<p>We use a third-party analytics service, Google Analytics, a service provided by
Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how
users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For
more information on how Google uses this data, go to
<a href="www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">here</a>. You may also download the
Google Analytics opt-out browser add on, available

job, fill out a customer survey, or otherwise communicate with us.</p>
<h4 id="users">Users</h4>

Services, we will also collect content from you, such as through periodic
updates (referred to as “Check-Ins”), virtual meetings, or other communications
(collectively, “User Content”). We only use User Content to provide our Service.</p>
<p>When you create a Range account and authenticate via a third-party service, like
Google, Slack, or Microsoft Teams, we may collect, store, and periodically
update the profile information associated with that third-party account that you
share with us. If you choose to authenticate with other services, during sign up
or otherwise, you are giving Range the permission to use, share, and store data
associated with those third-party services in a manner consistent with this
Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>Range partners with Stripe, Inc. for payment processing, and the payment
information you submit is collected and used by them in accordance with their
policies (<a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">see here</a>). Range doesn’t store your
payment information.</p>
<h4 id="children">Children</h4>
<p>Per our Terms of Service, Range is not for children. We do not knowingly collect
Personal Information from children under 16 years of age (or other age as
required by law). If you believe that a child has provided us with their
personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@range.co">feedback@range.co</a>. If we become aware
that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, we’ll
delete it, unless we are required to retain it under applicable law, and
terminate the child’s account as applicable.</p>
<h4 id="integrations">Integrations</h4>
<p>When you connect your Range account with additional third-party services (such

with that third-party account and its underlying resources. We make efforts to
limit data collection to the minimum required to provide the service to you.</p>

share User Content with other Users within your organization); (2) with our
third-party service providers who use that information to help us provide our
Services (e.g., IT support, hosting, payment processing, customer service, and
related services); or (3) when we have a good faith belief it is required by
law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process, or otherwise
required to protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety; enforce
our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an
investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence,
reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or
transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or
transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law.</p>
<p>We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose. For
example, we may share aggregated or de-identified data with prospects or
partners for business or research purposes, such as telling prospective
customers the average number of updates people share per week, or the percentage
of users who access our Services via a mobile device.</p>
<p>We may use third-party Application Program Interfaces (“APIs”) and Software
Development Kits (“SDKs”) as part of the functionality of our Services. For more
information about our use of APIs and SDKs, please contact us as set forth in
“<a href="#questions">Questions</a>” below.</p>
<h4 id="customer-support">Customer support</h4>

<h3 id="cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</h3>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels and local storage
(collectively, “Technologies”) to recognize you when you return to our Services
We use them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your
preferences, evaluate email effectiveness, and personalize information.</p>
<p>Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general categories:</p>
<ul>

to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify
irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security
or that allow you to make use of our functionality;</li>

our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us

specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some third-party services that we use, such as Intercom or Google Analytics, may
place their own cookies in your browser.</p>
<p>You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove
them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits. However,
if you adjust your preferences, our Services may not work properly. Please note
that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However,

Range.</p>
<h3 id="data-security">Data Security</h3>
<p>We follow industry-standard practices to protect the data we collect and
maintain. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we

strong password).</p>
