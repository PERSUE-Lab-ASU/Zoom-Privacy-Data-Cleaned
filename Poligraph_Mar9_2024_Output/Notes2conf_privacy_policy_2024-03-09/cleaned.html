<p>4. Cookies<br>
We use cookies on our website. These are small files that your browser automatically creates and that are stored on your device (PC, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our site. Cookies do not cause any damage to your device and do not contain viruses, trojans or other malware. Information is stored in the cookie that results in connection with the specific device used. However, this does not mean that we are immediately aware of your identity. The use of cookies serves on the one hand to make the use of our offer more pleasant for you. We use so-called session cookies to recognize that you have already visited individual pages on our website. These are automatically deleted after leaving our site.</p>
<p>In addition, we also use temporary cookies to optimize user-friendliness, which are stored on your device for a specific period of time. If you visit our site again to use our services, it is automatically recognized that you have already visited us and the inputs and settings you have made are restored so that you do not have to re-enter them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we use cookies to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for you in order to optimize our offer (see section 5). These cookies enable us to automatically recognize when you visit our site again. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined period of time. The data processed by cookies is necessary for the purposes mentioned to safeguard our legitimate interests and those of third parties in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or a message always appears before a new cookie is created. However, if you completely deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all the functions of our website.</p>
<p>5. Analysis tools<br>
a) tracking tools<br>
The tracking measures listed below and possibly used by us may be carried out on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR carried out. With the tracking measures used, we want to ensure a needs-based design and continuous optimization of our website. On the other hand, we use tracking measures to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for you in order to optimize our offer. These interests are to be regarded as legitimate within the meaning of the aforementioned regulation. The respective data processing purposes and data categories can be found in the corresponding tracking tools.</p>
<p>i) Google Analytics<br>
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (https://www.google.de/intl/de/about/) (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter “Google”). In this context, pseudonymised usage profiles are created and cookies (see section 4) are used. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website such as<br>
– browser type / version,<br>
– operating system used,<br>
– referrer URL (the previously visited page),<br>
– host name of the accessing computer (IP address),<br>
– time of the server request,<br>
are transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage for the purposes of market research and the needs-based design of this website. This information may also be passed on to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of us. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other Google data. The IP addresses are anonymized so that an assignment is not possible (IP masking).<br>
You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting the browser software accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case not all functions of our website can be used to their full extent. You can also prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on (https: //tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de). As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can also prevent Google Analytics from collecting data by clicking on this link. An opt-out cookie will be set which prevents the future collection of your data when you visit this website. The opt-out cookie is only valid in this browser and only for our websites and is stored on your device. If you delete the cookies in this browser, you will have to set the opt-out cookie again. Further information on data protection in connection with Google Analytics can be found in the Google Analytics Help (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de).</p>
<p>ii) Google Adwords Conversion Tracking<br>
We also use Google Conversion Tracking to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimizing our website. In doing so, Google Adwords will set a cookie (see section 4) on your computer if you have reached our website via a Google ad. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages on the website of the Adwords customer and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can see that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. Every Adwords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be tracked via the websites of Adwords customers. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Adwords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Adwords customers find out the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were forwarded to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified. If you do not want to take part in the tracking process, you can also refuse the setting of a cookie required for this – for example via a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies. You can also deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the “www.googleadservices.com” domain. You can find Google’s data protection information on conversion tracking here (https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html).</p>
<p>iii) Matomo<br>
We may use the open source software Matomo to analyze and statistically evaluate the use of the website. Cookies are used for this (see section 4). The information generated by the cookie about website usage is transferred to our server and summarized in pseudonymous usage profiles. The information is used to evaluate the use of the website and to enable a needs-based design of our website. The information will not be passed on to third parties. Under no circumstances will the IP address be associated with other data relating to the user. The IP addresses are anonymized so that an assignment is not possible (IP masking). Your visit to this website is currently being recorded by Matomo web analysis. Click here (https://matamo.org/docs/privacy/) so that your visit is no longer recorded.</p>
<p>6. Social media plug-ins<br>
On our website, on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR, possibly social plug-ins from the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to make our services better known. The underlying advertising purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR. Responsibility for the data protection-compliant operation is to be guaranteed by the respective provider. We integrate these plug-ins using the so-called two-click method in order to protect visitors to our website as best as possible.</p>
<p>a) Facebook<br>
Social media plugins from Facebook may be used on our website in order to make their use more personal. For this we use the “LIKE” or “SHARE” button. This is an offer from Facebook. When you visit a page on our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted directly from Facebook to your browser, which integrates it into the website. By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that your browser has accessed to the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not currently logged into Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is sent directly from your browser to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can assign your visit to our website directly to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example press the “LIKE” or “SHARE” button, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information is also published on Facebook and shown to your Facebook friends. Facebook can use this information for the purpose of advertising, market research and the needs-based design of Facebook pages. For this purpose, Facebook creates usage, interest and relationship profiles to evaluate your use of our website with regard to the advertisements shown to you on Facebook, to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website and to provide other services related to the use of Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to assign the data collected via our website to your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as your related rights and setting options to protect your privacy can be found in Facebook’s data protection information (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/).</p>
<p>b) Twitter<br>
Plugins of the short message network of Twitter Inc. (Twitter) may be integrated on our website. You can recognize the Twitter plugins (tweet button) by the Twitter logo on our site. You can find an overview of tweet buttons here (https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons). When you visit a page on our website that contains such a plug-in, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Twitter server. As a result, Twitter receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the Twitter “tweet button” while you are logged into your Twitter account, you can link the content of our website to your Twitter profile. This allows Twitter to assign your visit to our website to your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of the website, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted or how it is used by Twitter. If you do not want Twitter to be able to assign your visit to our website, please log out of your Twitter user account. Further information can be found in Twitter’s data protection declaration ((https://twitter.com/privacy).</p>
<p>c) Instagram<br>
Our website may also use so-called social plugins (“plugins”) from Instagram, which is operated by Instagram LLC., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (“Instagram”). The plugins are marked with an Instagram logo, for example in the form of an “Instagram camera”. When you visit a page on our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Instagram servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted directly from Instagram to your browser and integrated into the page. Through this integration, Instagram receives the information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have an Instagram profile or are not currently logged into Instagram. This information (including your IP address) is sent directly from your browser to an Instagram server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged in to Instagram, Instagram can immediately assign your visit to our website to your Instagram account. If you interact with the plugins, for example press the “Instagram” button, this information is also transmitted directly to an Instagram server and stored there. The information is also published on your Instagram account and shown to your contacts there. If you do not want Instagram to assign the data collected via our website directly to your Instagram account, you must log out of Instagram before visiting our website. You can find more information on this in Instagram’s data protection declaration (https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388).</p>
