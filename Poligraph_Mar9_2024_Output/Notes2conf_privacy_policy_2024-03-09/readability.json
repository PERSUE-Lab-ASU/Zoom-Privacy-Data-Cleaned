With the tracking measures used, we want to ensure a needs-based design and continuous optimization of our website. On the other hand, we use tracking measures to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for you in order to optimize our offer. These interests are to be regarded as legitimate within the meaning of the aforementioned regulation. The respective data processing purposes and data categories can be found in the corresponding tracking tools.</p>\n<p>i) Google Analytics<br>\nWe use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (https://www.google.de/intl/de/about/) (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter \u201cGoogle\u201d). In this context, pseudonymised usage profiles are created and cookies (see section 4) are used. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website such as<br>\n\u2013 browser type / version,<br>\n\u2013 operating system used,<br>\n\u2013 referrer URL (the previously visited page),<br>\n\u2013 host name of the accessing computer (IP address),<br>\n\u2013 time of the server request,<br>\nare transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage for the purposes of market research and the needs-based design of this website. This information may also be passed on to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of us. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other Google data. The IP addresses are anonymized so that an assignment is not possible (IP masking).<br>\nYou can prevent the installation of cookies by setting the browser software accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case not all functions of our website can be used to their full extent. You can also prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on (https: //tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de). As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can also prevent Google Analytics from collecting data by clicking on this link. An opt-out cookie will be set which prevents the future collection of your data when you visit this website. The opt-out cookie is only valid in this browser and only for our websites and is stored on your device. If you delete the cookies in this browser, you will have to set the opt-out cookie again. Further information on data protection in connection with Google Analytics can be found in the Google Analytics Help (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de).</p>\n<p>ii) Google Adwords Conversion Tracking<br>\nWe also use Google Conversion Tracking to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimizing our website. In doing so, Google Adwords will set a cookie (see section 4) on your computer if you have reached our website via a Google ad. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages on the website of the Adwords customer and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can see that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. Every Adwords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be tracked via the websites of Adwords customers. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Adwords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Adwords customers find out the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were forwarded to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified. If you do not want to take part in the tracking process, you can also refuse the setting of a cookie required for this \u2013 for example via a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies. You can also deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the \u201cwww.googleadservices.com\u201d domain.

Social media plug-ins<br>\nOn our website, on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR, possibly social plug-ins from the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to make our services better known. The underlying advertising purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR. Responsibility for the data protection-compliant operation is to be guaranteed by the respective provider. We integrate these plug-ins using the so-called two-click method in order to protect visitors to our website as best as possible.</p>\n<p>a) Facebook<br>\nSocial media plugins from Facebook may be used on our website in order to make their use more personal. For this we use the \u201cLIKE\u201d or \u201cSHARE\u201d button. This is an offer from Facebook. When you visit a page on our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted directly from Facebook to your browser, which integrates it into the website. By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that your browser has accessed to the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not currently logged into Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is sent directly from your browser to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can assign your visit to our website directly to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example press the \u201cLIKE\u201d or \u201cSHARE\u201d button, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information is also published on Facebook and shown to your Facebook friends. Facebook can use this information for the purpose of advertising, market research and the needs-based design of Facebook pages. For this purpose, Facebook creates usage, interest and relationship profiles to evaluate your use of our website with regard to the advertisements shown to you on Facebook, to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website and to provide other services related to the use of Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to assign the data collected via our website to your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website.

You can find an overview of tweet buttons here (https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons). When you visit a page on our website that contains such a plug-in, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Twitter server. As a result, Twitter receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the Twitter \u201ctweet button\u201d while you are logged into your Twitter account, you can link the content of our website to your Twitter profile. This allows Twitter to assign your visit to our website to your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of the website, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted or how it is used by Twitter. If you do not want Twitter to be able to assign your visit to our website, please log out of your Twitter user account.

The plugins are marked with an Instagram logo, for example in the form of an \u201cInstagram camera\u201d. When you visit a page on our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Instagram servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted directly from Instagram to your browser and integrated into the page. Through this integration, Instagram receives the information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have an Instagram profile or are not currently logged into Instagram. This information (including your IP address) is sent directly from your browser to an Instagram server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged in to Instagram, Instagram can immediately assign your visit to our website to your Instagram account. If you interact with the plugins, for example press the \u201cInstagram\u201d button, this information is also transmitted directly to an Instagram server and stored there. The information is also published on your Instagram account and shown to your contacts there. If you do not want Instagram to assign the data collected via our website directly to your Instagram account, you must log out of Instagram before visiting our website.
