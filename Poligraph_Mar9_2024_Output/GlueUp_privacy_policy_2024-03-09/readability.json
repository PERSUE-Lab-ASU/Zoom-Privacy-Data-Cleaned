By using the Service, you are consenting to have this data stored, transferred and processed according to this Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tGlue Up is a global company. Subject to applicable laws, we may transfer your Personal Data to any Glue Up and EventBank affiliate worldwide when processing that data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal grounds we are relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data in conjunction with the Service will be that: (i) you provided your consent; (ii) the processing is necessary for our contractual relationship; (iii) the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations; or (iv) the processing is in our legitimate interest in providing you with the Service.\n\t\t\tTransfers of Personal Data: Glue Up is a global company; thus, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally collected. This may be intra-group or to third parties that we work with who may be in jurisdictions outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, that have no data protection laws or laws that are less strict than those in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK. Whenever we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we take all legally required steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPersonal Data Retention/Rights: We retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide you with the Service, comply with applicable laws, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. If you have an account with us, we will typically retain your Personal Data for a period of 90 days after you have requested that your account is closed, or for up to seven years after your account becomes inactive but is not closed.\n\n\t\t\tData protection laws provide you with rights in respect to Personal Data that we hold about you, including the right to request a copy of the Personal Data, the right to request that we rectify, restrict or delete your Personal Data, and the right to unsubscribe from marketing communications.\n\n\t\t\tYou can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact information set out in Section 12.\n\n\t\t\tIf you have a complaint about how we handle your Personal Data, please contact us as set forth in Section 12. If you are not happy with how we have attempted to resolve your complaint, you may contact the relevant data protection authority.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGlue Up as a Data Controller and a Data Processor:\n\n\t\t\tEU data protection law distinguishes between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as \"data controllers\") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations or individuals (known as \"data processors\"). If you have any questions or complaints about how your Personal Data is handled, these should always be directed to the relevant data controller since they are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data.\n\n\t\t\tGlue Up may act as either a data controller or a data processor with respect to your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances. We will be a data controller of any information you submit to us in order to create a User account or an Organizer account. However, once a User submits Personal Data to an Organizer in conjunction with use of the Services, Glue Up becomes a data processor with respect to the Organizer Collected Personal Data.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tChanges To This Privacy Policy\n\n\tThis Privacy Policy was last updated on the date set forth at the top of this Privacy Policy.

Use of Personal Data we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Data is collected. If you use the Service after any updated Privacy Policy has been posted, that means that you agree to all the changes made with respect to all Personal Data, whether collected previously or in the future.\n\t\n\t\n\tMinors\n\n\tWe do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 14.
