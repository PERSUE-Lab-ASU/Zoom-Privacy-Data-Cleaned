Transfers of Personal Data: Glue Up is a global company; thus, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally collected. This may be intra-group or to third parties that we work with who may be in jurisdictions outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, that have no data protection laws or laws that are less strict than those in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK.
