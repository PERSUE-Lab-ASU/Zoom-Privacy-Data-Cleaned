This privacy policy describes how we collect, receive, use, store, share, transfer and process your personally identifiable information, as well as your rights in determining what we do with the information we collect or hold about you. Personally identifiable information may be related to a visitor of our Website (“Visitor”), a Platform account owner (”Client”), or a participant in an online voting event hosted on our Platform (“Participant”). Please read this privacy policy before submitting any personally identifiable information on our Platform.</p>

Privacy policy changes will apply only to information collected after the date of the change. You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you make use of our Platform to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide will be used.</p>

Please review the privacy policies posted at those websites.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Collection of Information</p>

        <p>On our Platform we collect personally identifiable information like name, email address, and financial information such as credit card number, when submitted by Clients for management of their online voting events.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Personally identifiable information is only used to fulfil the Visitor’s specific request or to help the Client manage online voting events and for billing purposes, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Access and Choice</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Upon request COD Poll will provide Visitors with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.

        <p>Upon request COD Poll will provide Clients with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend or delete it by making the change yourself within our Platform or by contacting us. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. We will retain Client information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Information Related to Data Controlled by our Clients</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Simply Voting processes Participant information under the direction of its Clients (such as contact name, organization, email address, etc), and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a Participant (the data subject) and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients (the data controller), please contact the Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer personally identifiable information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Access and Retention of Data Controlled by our Clients</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>COD Poll acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. COD Poll has no direct relationship with the individual Participants whose personal data it processes. An individual Participant who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to our Client. If requested to remove data by the Client we will respond within 30 days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We will retain Participant data we process on behalf of our Clients until the Client deletes the data or instructs us to delete the data.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Cookie and Tracking Technology</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On our Platform COD Poll and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to administer our Website, analyze trends, track users’ movements around our Website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On our Platform COD Poll uses cookies or similar technologies exclusively to administer our Platform. There is no third party use of cookies or similar technologies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our Website or Platform.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information on our Website and Platform and automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type &amp; operating system, referring/exit pages, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may link referring page to Visitor and Client information for marketing purposes. We may link IP address and timestamp to Client and Participant information to provide an audit trail. We may link browser type &amp; operating system to Participant information to provide aggregate reports. We do not otherwise link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our Platform provides Clients with an option to include Social Media features and widgets, for use by Participants. These features and widgets may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature or widget to function properly. Social Media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features and widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Distribution of Information</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are permitted in this privacy policy. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. In certain situations, COD Poll may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, enforce our policies, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We may provide your personally identifiable information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as processing payments. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If COD Poll is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we will notify our Clients by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in the account) or by means of a notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commitment to Data Security</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. Only authorized employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep information secure and confidential) have access to this information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All information submitted to our Website or Platform is encrypted via Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All sensitive payment information (credit card number, expiry date, validation code) is encrypted via TLS technology and then transmitted to our payment gateway provider. The payment gateway provider’s database is only accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and they are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your sensitive payment information will not be stored on our servers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Platform, you can contact us.</p>
