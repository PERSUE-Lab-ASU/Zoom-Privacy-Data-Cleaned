<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>



<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>

<p><strong>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</strong></p>



<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by sending us a message to leandata@leandata.com. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>



<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>



<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>



<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>



<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>



<p><strong>Response Timing and Format</strong></p>



<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.</p>



<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>



<p><strong>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</strong></p>



<p>While LeanData does not sell any personal information, you have the right, if you are 16 years of age or older, to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by sending us a message to leandata@leandata.com.</p>



<p>Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by visiting our Website and sending us a message. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;Non-Discrimination</strong></p>



<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>



<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>



<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>



<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>



<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send us an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:leandata@leandata.com">leandata@leandata.com</a>.</p>
