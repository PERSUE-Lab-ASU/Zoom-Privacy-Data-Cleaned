If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request\u2019s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While LeanData does not sell any personal information, you have the right, if you are 16 years of age or older, to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the \u201cright to opt-out\u201d).

Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.

We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Non-Discrimination</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.

For example, if you share your name and contact information to request a price quote or ask a question about our products or services, we will use that personal information to respond to your inquiry. If you provide your personal information to purchase a product or service, we will use that information to process your payment and facilitate delivery. We may also save your information to facilitate new product orders or process returns.\n\n\n\nTo provide you with support and to respond to your inquiries, including to investigate and address your concerns and monitor and improve our responses.\n\n\n\nTo respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.\n\n\n\nAs described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.\n\n\n\nWe will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.\n\n\n\n\nSharing Personal Information\n\n\n\nWe may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.\n\n\n\nDisclosures of Personal Information for a Business Purpose\n\n\n\nIn the preceding twelve (12) months, LeanData has not disclosed personal information for a business purpose.\n\n\n\nSales of Personal Information\n\n\n\nLeanData does not, and in the preceding twelve (12) months, has not sold personal information.\n\n\n\nYour Rights and Choices\n\n\n\nThe CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.\n\n\n\nAccess to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights\n\n\n\nYou have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:\n\n\n\n\nThe categories of personal information we collected about you.\n\n\n\nThe categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.\n\n\n\nOur business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.\n\n\n\nThe categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.\n\n\n\nThe specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).\n\n\n\nIf we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:\n\n\n\nsales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and\n\n\n\ndisclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.\n\n\n\n\nDeletion Request Rights\n\n\n\nYou have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions, by emailing us at leandata@leandatainc.com. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.\n\n\n\nWe may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:\n\n\n\n\nComplete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.\n\n\n\nDetect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.\n\n\n\nDebug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.\n\n\n\nExercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.\n\n\n\nComply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1546 et. seq.).\n\n\n\nEngage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information\u2019s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research\u2019s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.\n\n\n\nEnable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.\n\n\n\nComply with a legal obligation.\n\n\n\nMake other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.\n\n\n\n\nExercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights\n\n\n\nTo exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by sending us a message to leandata@leandata.com. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.\n\n\n\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:\n\n\n\n\nProvide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.\n\n\n\nDescribe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\n\n\n\n\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor\u2019s identity or authority to make the request.\n\n\n\nResponse Timing and Format\n\n\n\nWe endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request\u2019s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.\n\n\n\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\n\n\n\nPersonal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights\n\n\n\nWhile LeanData does not sell any personal information, you have the right, if you are 16 years of age or older, to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the \u201cright to opt-out\u201d). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the \u201cright to opt-in\u201d) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by sending us a message to leandata@leandata.com.\n\n\n\nOnce you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by visiting our Website and sending us a message. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Non-Discrimination\n\n\n\nWe will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:\n\n\n\n\nDeny you goods or services.\n\n\n\nCharge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.\n\n\n\nProvide you a different level or quality of goods or services.\n\n\n\nSuggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information\u2019s value and contain written terms that describe the program\u2019s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.\n\n\n\nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cShine the Light\u201d law (Civil Code Section \u00a7 1798.83) permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send us an email to\u00a0leandata@leandata.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n\n\nLast updated August 25, 2021\n\n\n\nI.
