See the Browser Level Information and IP Addresses section below for further detail. In some cases, one of our agents or Affiliates may collect the information on our behalf. Third party Service Providers (as defined below) that provide all or some of the services available through this Service also may be gathering the same kinds of information on our behalf.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"none\">Registration Information.</span></strong><span data-contrast=\"none\">&nbsp;To make use of certain features available through this Service (such as to receive email newsletters, to post a classified ad, or to participate in some social networking features) you may need to register and provide certain personal information as part of the registration process. (If permitted by this Service, you may be able to bypass some of the steps within the registration process by using the username and password associated with your account on certain specified social networking sites when you register for our Service, but you will still have to complete the registration process after entering that information.) We or our Service Providers may also ask for personal information from you if you buy products or services or conduct other transactions via our Service (for example: your name, email address, sex, age, zip code or credit card number, as well as information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like). The personal information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our Service to your interests and make them more useful to you. It may also be used in the processing of e-commerce transactions. In addition, our Service Providers may provide us with additional personal information about you that you provide to them through your separate accounts with them as described in their own privacy statements. The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such personal information is entirely voluntary. However, if you don\u2019t supply the personal information we request, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other users of our Service. For instance, we can\u2019t send you an email alerting you to a new service we\u2019re offering, or breaking news that may interest you, if you don\u2019t tell us what you\u2019re interested in and give us your email address.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"none\">Cookies.</span></strong><span data-contrast=\"none\">&nbsp;To help make our sites more responsive to the needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our users by placing a cookie (a small entry in a text file) on your device. Our advertisers and Service Providers may also assign their own cookies to your browser, which is a process that we don\u2019t control. We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs and to deliver a better, more personalized service. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our site or other sites visited by our users. We may also use cookies to measure site performance. We can build a better Service if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. You can manage your browser\u2019s cookie setting through the \u201coptions\u201d menu on most commercially available web browsers, including options to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely.

This privacy statement is provided by Continuant Inc., that operates this website to explain the ways in which we collect personal information from you through your use of this site\u00a0to improve your experience,\u00a0and the ways that we use that personal information.\u00a0\nPlease read this privacy statement carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices.\u00a0 By visiting our website, you agree that your use and any disputes over our online policy practices, is governed by this privacy statement and our Website Terms and Conditions.\u00a0\nThe term \u201cpersonal information\u201d as used in this privacy statement shall mean any information that enables us to identify you, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as (but not limited to) your name, location data, online identifier or one or more factors specific to you.\u00a0 If you have any questions regarding web privacy, please contact us at\u00a0info@continuant.com\u00a0\n\nYOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS\u00a0\nCalifornia law allows our California customers, once a year and free of charge, to request information about the\u00a0manner in which\u00a0we shared certain types of personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year. However, under the law, we are not required to provide this information as long as we: (1) notify you that you have the right to prevent disclosure and sharing of personal information, and (2) provide you with a cost-free means to exercise that opt out right. As noted in this privacy statement, we require California customers to opt-in to activities where we would share their personal information with third parties for those third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes. If you are a California customer and you would like to prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to participate in these activities. If you are a California customer and you have opted in to one of these activities, but you later decide that you would like to prevent our disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us at\u00a0info@continuant.com\u00a0\nTYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT\u00a0\nOverview.\u00a0The information we gather generally falls into one of two categories: (1) personal information (for example, your name and\u00a0email) that you voluntarily supply when you register with our Service, initiate transactions on or through the Service (such as buying products or services through the Service), or when you participate in the features we offer through the Service (such as comments posted on a blog, discussion group, or other social networking features on the Service), and (2) information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as visitors navigate through our Service. See the Browser Level Information and IP Addresses section below for further detail. In some cases, one of our agents or Affiliates may collect the information on our behalf. Third party Service Providers (as defined below) that provide all or some of the services available through this Service also may be gathering the same kinds of information on our behalf.\u00a0\nRegistration Information.\u00a0To make use of certain features available through this Service (such as to receive email newsletters, to post a classified ad, or to participate in some social networking features) you may need to register and provide certain personal information as part of the registration process. (If permitted by this Service, you may be able to bypass some of the steps within the registration process by using the username and password associated with your account on certain specified social networking sites when you register for our Service, but you will still have to complete the registration process after entering that information.) We or our Service Providers may also ask for personal information from you if you buy products or services or conduct other transactions via our Service (for example: your name, email address, sex, age, zip code or credit card number, as well as information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like). The personal information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our Service to your interests and make them more useful to you. It may also be used in the processing of e-commerce transactions. In addition, our Service Providers may provide us with additional personal information about you that you provide to them through your separate accounts with them as described in their own privacy statements. The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such personal information is entirely voluntary. However, if you don\u2019t supply the personal information we request, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other users of our Service. For instance, we can\u2019t send you an email alerting you to a new service we\u2019re offering, or breaking news that may interest you, if you don\u2019t tell us what you\u2019re interested in and give us your email address.\u00a0\nCookies.\u00a0To help make our sites more responsive to the needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our users by placing a cookie (a small entry in a text file) on your device. Our advertisers and Service Providers may also assign their own cookies to your browser, which is a process that we don\u2019t control. We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs and to deliver a better, more personalized service. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our site or other sites visited by our users. We may also use cookies to measure site performance. We can build a better Service if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. You can manage your browser\u2019s cookie setting through the \u201coptions\u201d menu on most commercially available web browsers, including options to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of our Service.\u00a0\nBrowser Level Information and IP Addresses.\u00a0Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration or your mobile device when you use our Service, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you\u2019re running, the resolution of your computer monitor or mobile device, the website that referred you, the type of device you\u2019re using, your IP address and your geographic location. Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers and mobile devices connected to the Internet to identify your computer or mobile device so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Service to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our Service. We may combine this information with the personal information you give to us along with whatever information we collect about you. We may use this combined personal information for purposes set out in this privacy statement. We do not respond to web browser \u201cdo not track\u201d signals. As such, your navigation of our Service may be tracked as part of the gathering of quantitative user information described above. If you arrive at our Sites by way of a link from a third party site that does respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d requests, the recognition of any \u201cdo not track\u201d request you have initiated will end as soon as you reach our Service.\u00a0\nMobile Applications and Location-Based Information.\u00a0Our Service may have the ability to use your geographic location to deliver content and services tailored to your location. If you choose to enable our Service to use your location information, then that information will be stored and used to deliver content and services tailored to your location. Also, when you use a mobile device or browser to access our Service, then your device and/or your browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your device\u2019s unique identifier, IP address, location information, device make/model, wireless provider, and related information to us and our Service Providers. We and our Service Providers may combine this information with personal information you give to us and personal information we collect about you. We will use this combined personal information to deliver content and services tailored to your location.\u00a0\nDISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION\u00a0\nWhy We Collect Information\u00a0From\u00a0You.\u00a0Like any business, it\u2019s important for us to know our customers \u2013 their needs, their likes, what they want and expect from us.\u00a0 Except as expressly set forth in this privacy statement, we will not provide, sell or rent to any third party any personal information that we collect from you through your use of this Service.\u00a0\nService Providers.\u00a0All or portions of our Service may be provided or supported by our third-party service providers (\u201cService Providers\u201d), and we may share any of the information that we collect from you through our Service with such Service Providers. In the event we offer services through this Service such as chat, email newsletters, email services and/or similar services, such services may be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services. We will only work with trusted Service Providers who provide guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing to be carried out and who can demonstrate a commitment to compliance with those measures. We do not allow Service Providers to use your personal information for their own purposes, unless indicated, and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. In some instances, our Service Providers will have the same access to your personal information as we do. Their use of the personal information may be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies.\u00a0\nStatistical Information.\u00a0Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic that visits various pages within our Service, and the habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated information does not include any\u00a0information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to any third parties as we see fit.\u00a0\nOther Disclosures.\u00a0We reserve the right to release personal information about users of our Service when release is necessary or appropriate to comply with law, to enforce this privacy statement, our Website Terms of Use or our visitor agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of our Service, the public, our customers, or our company and its employees, agents, partners and Affiliates. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets.\u00a0\u00a0\nMaintenance of Information.\u00a0We may store all information in our database even after such content has been deleted from public display. In addition, our web logs may be stored indefinitely, subject to applicable law. Although we use customary practices to store all information received from our users in a secure operating environment that is not available to general public, no guarantee can be provided that such information might not become available to persons outside of Continuant Inc.\u00a0\nINTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS\u00a0\nWe are headquartered in the United States. Your personal information may be accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States or to our Affiliates, partners or Service Providers who are located worldwide. If you are using our Service from outside the United States, be aware that your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or elsewhere where our servers are located, and our central database is operated. You acknowledge that the laws of such jurisdictions may be different to the laws in which you reside. By using our Service, you acknowledge and agree to any transfer of this information.\u00a0\nOPTING IN/OPTING OUT\u00a0\nIn certain places on this Service, we may ask you to consent to the sharing of your personal information with third parties with which we have business relationships. If you provide such consent (for example, by checking a box or by some other means), we will make your personal information available to such third parties as described in the consent form. If you register with this Service, you will have the opportunity to review or update the personal information you have provided us. You also have the option of deleting all personal information except for your email address. If you would like to completely deactivate your account, please contact us using at\u00a0info@continuant.com.\u00a0If you have submitted your personal information on a page provided in conjunction with one of our Service Providers, the personal information you submit may be jointly maintained by us and the Service Provider. If you decide to opt out of our Service, you may also need to contact the Service Provider separately to request the Service Provider to remove your personal information from its database.\u00a0\nDATA SECURITY\u00a0\nAll information gathered through our Service is stored within database(s) operated by us or by a Service Provider on our behalf. We and/or our Service Providers secure the personal information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.\u00a0 However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won\u2019t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.\u00a0\nHOW LONG DO WE RETAIN\u00a0INFORMATION\u00a0\nWe will store your personal information, in a form which permits us to identify you, for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which the personal information is processed. We may retain your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements and rights, or if it is not technically and reasonably feasible to remove it. Otherwise, we will seek to delete your personal information within a reasonable timeframe upon request.\u00a0\nCHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT\u00a0\nWe may change the terms of this privacy statement or introduce new terms and conditions from time to time, in which case we will post an updated version of this privacy statement on this Service and will update the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date above to reflect the date the changes take effect. By continuing to use this Service after we post any such changes, you accept this privacy statement, as modified.\u00a0\nQuestions regarding this privacy statement should be directed to us at\u00a0info@continuant.com.\u00a0\nCOOKIE POLICY\u00a0\nThank you for visiting this site, which is operated by Continuant Inc. This Cookie Policy tells you about the use of Cookies and similar technologies on all websites, mobile applications, and other digital platforms linking to or posting this Cookie Policy (collectively, the\u00a0\u201cSites\u201d).\u00a0\nWhen you first access the Site, you may receive a message advising you that cookies and similar technologies are in use.

You do not have to accept all cookies and consent can be withdrawn at any time (see also the How to Control Cookies section below). You can change your browser settings to refuse or restrict cookies, and you may delete them after they have been placed on your device at any time. If you do not accept or delete our cookies, some areas of the Sites that you access may take more time to work or may not function properly.\u00a0\nWhat Are Cookies?\u00a0\nCookies are small files containing a string of characters that we may store on your computer or mobile device when you visit the Sites. When you visit the Sites again, the cookies allow us to recognize your browser. Cookies may store your preferences and other information but cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.\u00a0\nCookies set by a website owner (in this case, Continuant Inc.) are called \u201cfirst-party cookies\u201d. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called \u201cthird-party cookies\u201d. Third-party cookies enable us to provide third party features or functionality through the Sites (i.e. advertising, social media functions and analytics).\u00a0\nThe Cookies We Use\u00a0\nCookies make the use of the Sites easier by, among other things, saving your preferences. We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of the Sites to personal information that you previously provided.\u00a0\nThe information that we collect with cookies allows us to statistically analyze usage of the Sites, and to improve and customize our content and other offerings. However, we only disclose information collected with cookies to third parties on an aggregated basis without the use of any information that personally identifies you.\u00a0\nHow to Control Cookies\u00a0\nWhen you first access the Sites from certain jurisdictions, you may receive a message advising you that cookies and similar technologies are in use.
