This Privacy Policy outlines what information we collect, how we use it, your rights, and our practices around that information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT, AND HOW WE USE IT</strong></p>\n<p>All of the information we collect in Coaching Loft is in one of three varieties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.1 USER ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>This is the stuff of \"who's who\" in the system: coaches who sign up, the clients they add to the system, and the other coaches that are added to any given Team Edition account.</p>\n<p>The information collected is, at minimum, name, username, email address, and password.</p>\n<p>(Well actually we only store a garbled-up version of passwords through the groovy mathematical trick of one-way hashing--we have no idea what your real password is, but when you log in, we sure can compute whether or not you do!)</p>\n<p>Additional user account information that CAN be optionally entered and stored includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Telephone number(s)</li>\n<li>Time zone</li>\n<li>Avatar image</li>\n<li>Gender</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>1.2 HOW WE USE ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>All user information is used exclusively for the delivery of the Coaching Loft application user experience.&nbsp; Specifically, this includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proper identification and authentication to access the system based on login credentials (username and password).</li>\n<li>In-app display of user activity (e.g. a name &amp; headshot of who posted a comment).</li>\n<li>Sending emails (including system-generated notifications, messages to and from system users, and messages from CL staff to system users).</li>\n<li>Sending system-generated text messages to users with North American cell phone numbers.</li>\n<li>Conversion of times (e.g. \"Sent on:\" dates) to a user's time zone.</li>\n<li>Generation of gender-specific language (e.g. using \"his\" or \"her\" rather than \"their\").</li>\n<li>CL staff to identify users when assisting with support requests.</li>\n<li>Management and processing of subscription payments for the Coaching Loft service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that's it.&nbsp; It's just for Coaching Loft to communicate with users and the delivery of the Coaching Loft application itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.3 USAGE DATA</strong></p>\n<p>This is automatically collected log information, including AND limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Records of login activity (who logged in, when, which browser, and from what IP address)</li>\n<li>Records of in-app activity (who issued what request to the server in the course of using the application, when, and the CPU run time of processing the request)</li>\n<li>Records of visits to the public-facing marketing website and blog.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>1.4 HOW WE USE USAGE DATA</strong></p>\n<p>This information is used exclusively by CL staff and exclusively for the purposes of aiding in support, troubleshooting, debugging, and performance tuning.&nbsp; When someone reports an issue it's super nice not to have to ask which browser they were using.&nbsp; This record is also handy to figure out when we can drop support for the next oldest version of IE without making anyone mad. :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.5 COACHING DATA</strong></p>\n<p>This is the real meat of why anyone would use Coaching Loft.&nbsp; \"Coaching Data\" encompasses anything that the coach (or in many cases coachee) can set up in the course of using CL to support, document, or communicate within a coaching relationship, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Action items</li>\n<li>Metrics and data</li>\n<li>Worksheets</li>\n<li>Session Notes</li>\n<li>Journal Entries</li>\n<li>File uploads, links, and embedded media</li>\n<li>Whiteboards</li>\n<li>Appointments and calendar data feeds</li>\n<li>Templates</li>\n<li>Courses</li>\n<li>Other in-app settings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>1.6 HOW WE USE COACHING DATA</strong></p>\n<p>We don't.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; That's your business, not ours.</p>\n<p>Technically, though, there is something we do with it, and it is exactly what you'd expect.&nbsp; We capture and store coaching data, as entered by coaches and the people they coach, for the purpose of making it accessible to authorized users, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data that can be accessed in-app by the user who entered it.</li>\n<li>Data that can be accessed in-app by other users who should see it (e.g. Action items set up by a coach for a client, or Session Notes for a client that were NOT marked private).</li>\n<li>Data delivered by email to other parties as initiated by user action (e.g. a progress report set to send weekly to a designated email recipient).</li>\n<li>Appointment data privately made available for calendar system interchange.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>1.7 HOW WE USE COOKIES</strong></p>\n<p>Coaching Loft, like any other web application uses cookies.
