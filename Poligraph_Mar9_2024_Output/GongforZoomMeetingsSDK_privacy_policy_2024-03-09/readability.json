In such instances, we may share relevant contact, business and usage details with the respective partner, to allow them to engage with those entities and individuals for such purposes. If you directly engage with any of our partners, please note that any aspect of that engagement which is not directly related to the Services and directed by Gong is beyond the scope of Gong\u2019s Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, and may therefore be covered by the partner\u2019s terms and privacy policy.\n</p> <p><em><u>Service Integrations</u></em>: You may choose to use a third-party service to integrate with our Services, for example in order to upload or retrieve personal data to or from the Services, or to enrich the data you have processed on either service or enhance your usage thereof (provided that such integration is supported by our Services). The provider of this integrated third-party service may receive certain relevant data about or from your account on the Services, or share certain relevant data from your account on the third-party provider\u2019s service with our Services, depending on the nature and purpose of such integration. This could include your Customer Data and/or User Data. Note that we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third-party services (but do typically require your API key in order to integrate with them).\n</p> <p><em><u>Event Sponsors</u></em>: If you attend an event or webinar organized by us, or download or access an asset on our Sites related to such an event, webinar or other activity involving third-party sponsors or presenters, we may share your personal data with them.

In these circumstances, your personal data will be subject to the sponsors\u2019 privacy statements. If you do not wish for your personal data to be shared, you may choose to not opt-in via event/webinar registration or elect to not have your badge scanned, or you can opt-out in accordance with <a href=\"#datasubjectrights\">Section <em>\u200e</em>9</a> below;\n</p> <p><em><u>Business Customers</u></em>: Our Customers have access to any personal data we process on their behalf in our capacity as a \u201cprocessor\u201d or a \u201cservice provider.\u201d\n</p> <p><em><u>Legal Compliance</u></em>: We may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your personal data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b) disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such disclosure is required to protect our legitimate business interests, including the security or integrity of our products and services.\n</p> <p><em><u>Protecting Rights and Safety</u></em>: We may share personal data with others if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of Gong, any of our Users or Customers, or any members of the general public.\n</p> <p><em><u>Gong Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies</u></em>: We may share personal data internally within our group, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, should Gong or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates undergo any change in control or ownership, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all or part of its assets, personal data may be shared with or transferred to the parties involved in such an event. We may disclose personal data to a third party during negotiation of, in connection with or as an asset in such a corporate business transaction. Personal data may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.\n</p> <p>\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Gong may share personal data in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal, non-identifiable and anonymous. We may transfer, share or otherwise use non-personal and non-identifiable data at our sole discretion and without the need for further approval.\n</p> <p>\n\nFor the purposes of the CCPA, in the past 12 months, we may have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information, as defined in the CCPA: identifiers; customer record information; internet or other electronic network activity information; professional or employment-related information; geolocation data; commercial information; inferences; and audio, electronic and visual information to Service Providers, partnerships, service integrations, Gong subsidiaries and affiliated companies, for legal compliance, or to protect rights and safety.

Cookies and Data Collection Technologies</strong></p> <p>\n\nWe and our Service Providers use cookies, pixels and other technologies to enable and improve the Services we provide, to track the performance of our Sites, perform analytics and gain insights on the use of our Services and the performance of our activities, and for personalization purposes.\n</p> <p>\n\nCookies are packets of information sent to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the server that sent the cookie. Some cookies are removed when you close your browser session. These are the \u201cSession Cookies\u201d. Some last for longer periods and are called \u201cPersistent Cookies\u201d. We use both types.\n</p> <p>\n\nWe use \u201cPersistent Cookies\u201d to remember your log-in details and make it easier for you to log-in the next time you access the Platform. We may use this type of cookies and Session Cookies for additional purposes, to facilitate the use of the Services\u2019 features and tools.\n</p> <p>\n\nSome cookies are necessary for the Services to function properly, and cannot be declined or disabled unless you delete and block them through your web browser settings. Other cookies, which are used for functional, performance, analytics and marketing purposes, are optional. These include web analytics tools, including Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Mouseflow. These tools help us understand Users\u2019 behavior on our Services, including by tracking page content, and click/touch, movements, scrolls and keystroke activities. Further information about the privacy practices of our analytics service providers is available at: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/; https://mixpanel.com/terms/ and https://mouseflow.com/terms/.

If you choose to opt-out of certain cookies, this will typically generate a new cookie which will preserve your choice, and indicate it to our Services in your next visits so that the cookies you opted-out of will not be utilized. You can also manage your cookies preferences, and accept, remove or entirely block cookies, through your browser settings. Certain web browsers may transmit \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals to websites with which the browser communicates. However, due to differences in how web browsers interpret this feature and send those signals, and lack of standardization, we currently do not respond to such \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals.\n</p> <p>\n\nPlease note that if you get a new device, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser\u2019s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), you may also clear the opt-out cookies installed once you opt-out, so an additional opt-out will be necessary to prevent additional tracking.\n</p> <p><strong><a id=\"communications\"></a>7. Communications</strong></p> <p>\n\nWe engage in service and promotional communications, through e-mail, phone, SMS and notifications.\n</p> <p><em><u>Service Communications</u></em>: We may contact you with important information regarding our Services.

Such rights may include \u2013 to the extent applicable \u2013 the right to know/request access to (specific pieces of personal data collected; categories of personal data collected; categories of sources from whom the personal data was collected; purpose of collecting personal data; categories of third parties with whom we have shared personal data), to request rectification or erasure of your personal data held with Gong, or to restrict or object to such personal data processing (including the right to direct us not to sell or share your personal data to third parties now or in the future, as described below), or to port such personal data, or the right to equal services and prices (e.g., freedom from discrimination) (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you). If you are a GDPR-protected individual, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority in the EU or the UK, as applicable. If you are an LGPD-protected individual, you also have the rights to confirmation of existence of processing; to request review of decisions made solely based on automatic decisions that affect your interests; to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority and with consumer protection authorities in Brazil.\n</p> <p>\n\nTo the extent applicable to you, you may also designate an authorized agent, in writing or through a power of attorney, to request to exercise your privacy rights on your behalf. The authorized agent may submit a request to exercise these rights by emailing us.\n</p> <p>\n\nPlease note that when you or an authorized agent ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal data related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access. If your request relates to personal data that may be processed on our Customer\u2019s behalf, as their \u201cdata processor\u201d or \u201cservice provider\u201d (as further explained in <a href=\"#datacontroller\">Section 10</a> below), note that such Customer exclusively determines how such data is processed, as well as if and how your request should be handled \u2013 so we advise that you submit your request directly to them. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information that enables us to reasonably verify that you are the individual about whom we collected the personal data, or that such data is processed on behalf of one of our Customers, so that we may forward it to such Customer for their further handling. Such additional information may be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g., as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request, or proof of request fulfillment).\n</p> <p>\n\nWe may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data or confidential information related to others.\n</p> <p>\n\nIn compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, and the UK Extension of the EU-U.S. DPP and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Information. EEA, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Data Privacy Framework compliance should submit inquiries to <a href=\"mailto:dpo@gong.io\">dpo@gong.io</a>. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, Gong.io, Inc. has further committed to cooperate with EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), the UK Information Commissioner Office (UK ICO), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) to independently address complaints that we have been unable to resolve.\n</p> <p>\n\nPlease note that under certain conditions (as described under the DPF Principles that Gong.io Inc. adheres to), you can invoke a binding arbitration by delivering a notice to us via <a href=\"mailto:dpo@gong.io\">dpo@gong.io</a>.

Data Controller/Processor</strong></p> <p>\n\nCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR, UK GDPR, Brazilian Data Protection Act, and the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the \u201cdata controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cdata processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.\n</p> <p>\n\nGong is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cdata processor\u201d.\n</p> <p>\n\nGong is the \u201cdata processor\u201d of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our Customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data); and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201csub-processors\u201d of such data.\n</p> <p>\n\nGong is both a \u201cdata controller\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d of User Data. Such data is processed by Gong for its own purposes (as described in <a href=\"#datauses\">Section 2</a> above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our Customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.\n</p> <p>\n\nAccordingly, Gong processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with our Customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such Customer.\n</p> <p>\n\nOur Customers are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services, and for ensuring that all individuals using the Services on the Customer\u2019s behalf or at their request, as well as all individuals whose personal data may be included in Customer Data processed through the Services, have been provided with adequate notice and given informed consent to the processing of their personal data, where such consent is necessary or advised, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording, use or other processing of data through our Services are fully met by the Customer, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship. Our Customers are also responsible for handling data subject rights requests under applicable law, by their Users and other individuals whose data they process through the Services.\n</p> <p><strong><a id=\"optoutsale\"></a>11. Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing</strong></p> <p>\n\nUnder some US data protection laws, like the CCPA, our disclosure of certain internet activity and device information with third parties through cookies on our website may be considered a \u201csale\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of personal information. We do so in pursuit of the business and commercial purposes described in <a href=\"#datauses\">Section 2</a> above.\n</p> <p>\n\nFor the purposes of the CCPA, in the last 12 months we may have \u201csold\u201d or \u201cshared\u201d Internet or other electronic network activity information, Geolocation data, Commercial information, and Inferences with our analytics and advertising Service Providers. Gong has not knowingly sold or shared the personal information of individuals under the age of 16.\n</p> <p>\n\nYou may opt out of all Cookies that may result in a \u201csale\u201d and/or \u201csharing\u201d of your personal information in the following ways:\n</p> <div data-block=\"f5abc2\"><ul><div data-block=\"eab350\"><p><li>Click the <span><a>\u201cYour Privacy Choices\u201d</a></span> button (available in our website\u2019s footer), move the toggle switch next to \u201cShare or Sale of Personal Information\u201d to grey (disabled), then click the \u201cConfirm my Choices\u201d button.</li></p></div> <div data-block=\"eab350\"><p><li>Please note: If you visit us from a different device or browser, or clear cookies, then you need to return to this screen to re-select your preferences.</li></p></div></ul></div> <p>\n\nSet the <strong>Global Privacy Control (GPC)</strong> for each participating browser system that you use to opt out of the use of third-party Advertising or other cookies (instructions on how to download and use GPC are available <a href=\"https://globalprivacycontrol.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>).\n</p> <p><strong><a id=\"additionalnotice\"></a>12.

Data Location \n\nWe and our authorized Service Providers (defined below) maintain, store and process personal data in the United States of America, Europe, Israel and other locations, as reasonably necessary for the proper performance and delivery of our Services, or as may be required by law.\n \n\nWhile privacy laws may vary between jurisdictions, Gong is committed to protect personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and customary industry standards, and such appropriate lawful mechanisms and contractual terms requiring adequate data protection, regardless of any lesser legal requirements that may apply in the jurisdiction to which such data is transferred.\n \n\nGong.io Ltd. is headquartered in Israel, a jurisdiction which is considered by the European Commission, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), and the UK Secretary of State to be offering an adequate level of protection for the personal data of residents of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), Switzerland and the UK, respectively. We transfer personal data from the EEA, Switzerland and the UK to Israel on this basis.\n \n\nGong.io Inc., our US subsidiary, complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and will be further liable in cases of onward transfers of your personal data to third parties (including our Service Providers).\n \n\nGong.io Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) regarding the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.\n \n\nGong.io Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) regarding the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.\n \n\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern for personal data transferred under the DPF. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.\n \n\nFor data transfers from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK to countries which are not considered to be offering an adequate level of data protection, we and the relevant data exporters and importers have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission, FDPIC and UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO).

Data Disclosure \n\nWe disclose personal data in the following ways:\n Service Providers: We engage selected third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf or complementary to our own.

In such instances, we may share relevant contact, business and usage details with the respective partner, to allow them to engage with those entities and individuals for such purposes. If you directly engage with any of our partners, please note that any aspect of that engagement which is not directly related to the Services and directed by Gong is beyond the scope of Gong\u2019s Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, and may therefore be covered by the partner\u2019s terms and privacy policy.\n Service Integrations: You may choose to use a third-party service to integrate with our Services, for example in order to upload or retrieve personal data to or from the Services, or to enrich the data you have processed on either service or enhance your usage thereof (provided that such integration is supported by our Services). The provider of this integrated third-party service may receive certain relevant data about or from your account on the Services, or share certain relevant data from your account on the third-party provider\u2019s service with our Services, depending on the nature and purpose of such integration. This could include your Customer Data and/or User Data. Note that we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third-party services (but do typically require your API key in order to integrate with them).\n Event Sponsors: If you attend an event or webinar organized by us, or download or access an asset on our Sites related to such an event, webinar or other activity involving third-party sponsors or presenters, we may share your personal data with them. If required by applicable law, you may consent to such sharing via the registration form or by allowing your attendee badge to be scanned at a sponsor booth. In these circumstances, your personal data will be subject to the sponsors\u2019 privacy statements. If you do not wish for your personal data to be shared, you may choose to not opt-in via event/webinar registration or elect to not have your badge scanned, or you can opt-out in accordance with Section \u200e9 below;\n Business Customers: Our Customers have access to any personal data we process on their behalf in our capacity as a \u201cprocessor\u201d or a \u201cservice provider.\u201d\n Legal Compliance: We may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your personal data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b) disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such disclosure is required to protect our legitimate business interests, including the security or integrity of our products and services.\n Protecting Rights and Safety: We may share personal data with others if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of Gong, any of our Users or Customers, or any members of the general public.\n Gong Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies: We may share personal data internally within our group, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, should Gong or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates undergo any change in control or ownership, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all or part of its assets, personal data may be shared with or transferred to the parties involved in such an event. We may disclose personal data to a third party during negotiation of, in connection with or as an asset in such a corporate business transaction. Personal data may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.\n \n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Gong may share personal data in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal, non-identifiable and anonymous. We may transfer, share or otherwise use non-personal and non-identifiable data at our sole discretion and without the need for further approval.\n \n\nFor the purposes of the CCPA, in the past 12 months, we may have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information, as defined in the CCPA: identifiers; customer record information; internet or other electronic network activity information; professional or employment-related information; geolocation data; commercial information; inferences; and audio, electronic and visual information to Service Providers, partnerships, service integrations, Gong subsidiaries and affiliated companies, for legal compliance, or to protect rights and safety. We may have disclosed identifiers and customer record information to event sponsors. We do so in pursuit of the business and commercial purposes described in Section 2 above.\n 6. Cookies and Data Collection Technologies \n\nWe and our Service Providers use cookies, pixels and other technologies to enable and improve the Services we provide, to track the performance of our Sites, perform analytics and gain insights on the use of our Services and the performance of our activities, and for personalization purposes.\n \n\nCookies are packets of information sent to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the server that sent the cookie. Some cookies are removed when you close your browser session. These are the \u201cSession Cookies\u201d. Some last for longer periods and are called \u201cPersistent Cookies\u201d. We use both types.\n \n\nWe use \u201cPersistent Cookies\u201d to remember your log-in details and make it easier for you to log-in the next time you access the Platform. We may use this type of cookies and Session Cookies for additional purposes, to facilitate the use of the Services\u2019 features and tools.\n \n\nSome cookies are necessary for the Services to function properly, and cannot be declined or disabled unless you delete and block them through your web browser settings. Other cookies, which are used for functional, performance, analytics and marketing purposes, are optional. These include web analytics tools, including Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Mouseflow. These tools help us understand Users\u2019 behavior on our Services, including by tracking page content, and click/touch, movements, scrolls and keystroke activities. Further information about the privacy practices of our analytics service providers is available at: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/; https://mixpanel.com/terms/ and https://mouseflow.com/terms/. Further information about your option to opt-out of these analytics services is available at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout; https://mixpanel.com/optout; and https://mouseflow.com/opt-out/.\n \n\nYou may opt-in or opt-out to the use of such optional cookies through the \u201cYour Privacy Choices\u201d feature available on our website. If you choose to opt-out of certain cookies, this will typically generate a new cookie which will preserve your choice, and indicate it to our Services in your next visits so that the cookies you opted-out of will not be utilized. You can also manage your cookies preferences, and accept, remove or entirely block cookies, through your browser settings. Certain web browsers may transmit \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals to websites with which the browser communicates. However, due to differences in how web browsers interpret this feature and send those signals, and lack of standardization, we currently do not respond to such \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals.\n \n\nPlease note that if you get a new device, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser\u2019s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), you may also clear the opt-out cookies installed once you opt-out, so an additional opt-out will be necessary to prevent additional tracking.\n 7. Communications \n\nWe engage in service and promotional communications, through e-mail, phone, SMS and notifications.\n Service Communications: We may contact you with important information regarding our Services. For example, we may send you notifications (through any of the means available to us) of changes or updates to our Services, billing issues, log-in attempts or password reset notices, etc. If you are registered as a User to our Services, you can typically control your communications and notifications settings from your profile settings, or otherwise in accordance with the instructions included in the communications sent to you. Please note that you will not be able to opt out of receiving certain service communications which are integral to your use (like password resets or billing notices).\n Promotional Communications: We may also notify you about new features, additional offerings, events, special opportunities or any other information we think you will find valuable, as our Customer, User or Prospect. We may provide such notices through any of the contact means available to us (e.g., phone, mobile or e-mail), through the Services, or through our marketing campaigns on any other sites or platforms.\n \n\nIf you do not wish to receive such promotional communications, you may notify Gong at any time by sending an e-mail to: privacy@gong.io, changing your communications preferences in your profile settings whilst being logged as a User to our Services, or by following the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d, \u201cstop\u201d, \u201copt-out\u201d or \u201cchange e-mail preferences\u201d instructions contained in the promotional communications you receive.\n 8. Data Security \n\nWe implement systems, applications and procedures designed to secure your personal data, to minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information. However, we cannot guarantee that our Sites or Services will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.\n \n\nTo learn more, please visit https://www.gong.io/trust-center/security/.\n 9. Data Subject Rights \n\nIndividuals have rights concerning their personal data. Please contact us by e-mail at: privacy@gong.io if you wish to exercise your privacy rights under any applicable law, including the EU or UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Brazilian Data Protection Act (LGPD), the CCPA, or the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) .

If you are a GDPR-protected individual, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority in the EU or the UK, as applicable. If you are an LGPD-protected individual, you also have the rights to confirmation of existence of processing; to request review of decisions made solely based on automatic decisions that affect your interests; to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority and with consumer protection authorities in Brazil.\n \n\nTo the extent applicable to you, you may also designate an authorized agent, in writing or through a power of attorney, to request to exercise your privacy rights on your behalf. The authorized agent may submit a request to exercise these rights by emailing us.\n \n\nPlease note that when you or an authorized agent ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal data related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access. If your request relates to personal data that may be processed on our Customer\u2019s behalf, as their \u201cdata processor\u201d or \u201cservice provider\u201d (as further explained in Section 10 below), note that such Customer exclusively determines how such data is processed, as well as if and how your request should be handled \u2013 so we advise that you submit your request directly to them. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information that enables us to reasonably verify that you are the individual about whom we collected the personal data, or that such data is processed on behalf of one of our Customers, so that we may forward it to such Customer for their further handling. Such additional information may be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g., as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request, or proof of request fulfillment).\n \n\nWe may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data or confidential information related to others.\n \n\nIn compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, and the UK Extension of the EU-U.S. DPP and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Information. EEA, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Data Privacy Framework compliance should submit inquiries to dpo@gong.io. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, Gong.io, Inc. has further committed to cooperate with EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), the UK Information Commissioner Office (UK ICO), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) to independently address complaints that we have been unable to resolve.\n \n\nPlease note that under certain conditions (as described under the DPF Principles that Gong.io Inc. adheres to), you can invoke a binding arbitration by delivering a notice to us via dpo@gong.io. Please also note that Gong.io Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n 10. Data Controller/Processor \n\nCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR, UK GDPR, Brazilian Data Protection Act, and the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the \u201cdata controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cdata processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.\n \n\nGong is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cdata processor\u201d.\n \n\nGong is the \u201cdata processor\u201d of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our Customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data); and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201csub-processors\u201d of such data.\n \n\nGong is both a \u201cdata controller\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d of User Data. Such data is processed by Gong for its own purposes (as described in Section 2 above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our Customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.\n \n\nAccordingly, Gong processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with our Customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such Customer.\n \n\nOur Customers are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services, and for ensuring that all individuals using the Services on the Customer\u2019s behalf or at their request, as well as all individuals whose personal data may be included in Customer Data processed through the Services, have been provided with adequate notice and given informed consent to the processing of their personal data, where such consent is necessary or advised, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording, use or other processing of data through our Services are fully met by the Customer, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship. Our Customers are also responsible for handling data subject rights requests under applicable law, by their Users and other individuals whose data they process through the Services.\n 11. Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing \n\nUnder some US data protection laws, like the CCPA, our disclosure of certain internet activity and device information with third parties through cookies on our website may be considered a \u201csale\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of personal information. We do so in pursuit of the business and commercial purposes described in Section 2 above.\n \n\nFor the purposes of the CCPA, in the last 12 months we may have \u201csold\u201d or \u201cshared\u201d Internet or other electronic network activity information, Geolocation data, Commercial information, and Inferences with our analytics and advertising Service Providers. Gong has not knowingly sold or shared the personal information of individuals under the age of 16.\n \n\nYou may opt out of all Cookies that may result in a \u201csale\u201d and/or \u201csharing\u201d of your personal information in the following ways:\n Click the \u201cYour Privacy Choices\u201d button (available in our website\u2019s footer), move the toggle switch next to \u201cShare or Sale of Personal Information\u201d to grey (disabled), then click the \u201cConfirm my Choices\u201d button. Please note: If you visit us from a different device or browser, or clear cookies, then you need to return to this screen to re-select your preferences. \n\nSet the Global Privacy Control (GPC) for each participating browser system that you use to opt out of the use of third-party Advertising or other cookies (instructions on how to download and use GPC are available here).\n 12.
