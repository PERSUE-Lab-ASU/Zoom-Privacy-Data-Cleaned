A \u201c<strong>Research Session</strong>\u201d is an interview, survey, testing, or other research session in which Participants provide feedback to or otherwise interact directly with Researchers outside of the Services. Any personal data or other information collected during a Research Session is collected directly by the applicable Researcher and is not provided to or otherwise disclosed to UI.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><p>There are two types of Participants who use our Services: \u201c<strong>Recruit Participants</strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>Researcher-Affiliated Participants</strong>.\u201d You are a Recruit Participant if you created an account and registered through the Services directly to apply to Projects for one or more Researchers. You are a Researcher-Affiliated Participant if you were included in a data set uploaded by a Researcher or you completed an opt-in form from a Researcher. If you are a Researcher-Affiliated Participant, please also review the terms, conditions, and privacy policy of the Researcher with whom you are associated for additional terms that apply to you. For more information about who is the controller of data and under what circumstances, please refer to the \u201cYour Rights and Choices\u201d section below.<br>\u200d</p><h5><strong>Information We Collect&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>UI may collect personal data about you in the following ways: directly from you if you use our Services or communicate with us; through automated technologies such as cookies; and from third-party sources such as our customers and business partners.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><h6><strong>Information you provide directly</strong></h6><p>If you are a Researcher, we may collect the following personal data from you:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Contact details, such as your name, email address, and telephone number;&nbsp;</li><li>Employment information, such as your company name and job title;&nbsp;</li><li>Comments, feedback, and communications with us or other users of our Services;&nbsp;</li><li>Communication preferences, language preferences, or other preferences;&nbsp;</li><li>Audio or visual information, such as recordings of your interactions with customer support;</li><li>Payment information, such as your credit card or debit card number; and/or</li><li>Username and password.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>\u200d</p><p>If you are a Recruit Participant, we may collect the following personal data from you:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Contact details, such as your name, email address, telephone number, and social media handle;</li><li>The city, state, and/or country where you are located;&nbsp;</li><li>Demographic information, such as your date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity;</li><li>Educational, employment, or other professional information;</li><li>Information about your family and household such as household income, marital status, and living situation;&nbsp;</li><li>Your access and use of devices and operating systems;&nbsp;</li><li>Comments, feedback, and communications with us or other users of our Services;</li><li>Communication preferences, language preferences, or other preferences;&nbsp;</li><li>Audio or visual information, such as recordings of your interactions with customer support;</li><li>W-9 information, such as your taxpayer identification number (if required based on the amount of incentives paid to you in a calendar year);&nbsp;</li><li>Username and password; and/or</li><li>Any additional categories of personal data you submit to the Services when applying to Projects (such as your responses to screener surveys created by or on behalf of Researchers).&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br>If you are a Researcher-Affiliated Participant, then you or the applicable Researcher may provide us with information about you, including your name, email address, and any other categories of data as determined by the Researcher in their sole discretion, subject to applicable contractual limitations.

If you use this feature, we may ask you for information needed to contact the referral, such as your friend\u2019s name and email address. We will send your friend an email stating that you referred your friend and we may, from time to time, send additional messages to your friend as a reminder of your invitation. If your friend wishes to stop receiving these messages, your friend can follow the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link at the bottom of any message. By providing your friends\u2019 names and email addresses, you represent that you have the authority to do so and that such individuals have consented to the disclosure of their information for these purposes.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><h6><strong>Information collected through automated technologies</strong></h6><p>We, our service providers, and vendors may automatically collect information about how you use our Services using technologies such as cookies, web beacons, session replay software, and scripts (collectively referred to as \u201ccookies\u201d in this Privacy Policy). These technologies typically work by placing a small file (like a text file or graphic) on your browser, and the file is used to identify your device and to collect information. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP address), internet service provider (ISP), operating system, browser type and settings, device identifier details, search terms and search results, location data, online browsing behavior data or clickstream data (e.g., date and time of access, referring and exit pages, pages viewed, features used, cursor movements and clicks, customer service interactions, screen recordings, and other actions you take in connection with the Services), or other usage information. We may combine the information collected through cookies with other information we collect about you.<br>\u200d</p><p>When you use the Services, we and our service providers may collect general location information from your computer or mobile device. \u201cGeneral\u201d location information means information to identify the city and state in which your device is located based on its IP address.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><p>We may also allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers) on our Services that use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant and targeted content and advertising to you on the Services and other websites you visit and applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches, and other information we collect about you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><p>Cookies are typically assigned to one of the following categories, depending on their function and intended purpose:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies.</strong> These cookies are used for the operation of our site and Services, authentication of visitors, and to help remember your preferences. These cookies may not be disabled and are required for the operation of our site and Services.</li><li><strong>Functional Cookies.</strong> These cookies enable our site and Services to provide enhanced functionality and personalization.&nbsp;They may be set by us or by third-party providers. If you do not allow these cookies, some services may not function properly.</li><li><strong>Analytics Cookies.</strong> We use third-party cookies such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Microsoft Clarity to gather information about website user activities. These analytics cookies help us analyze and improve the performance of our site. They also help us understand how you use our Services, and which types of devices you use to access them. Third-party analytics cookies may use IP addresses but are generally not tied to other personal data. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Advertising Cookies.</strong> We use third-party cookies from companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, and others in order to send you personalized promotions and advertisements through these platforms. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising from us.</li></ul><p><br>Most browsers are set up to accept cookies automatically. While we do not currently respond to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser signals, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to inform you before the cookie is stored on your computer or other device. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Services may not operate correctly. You can find more information about cookies and how they work at <a href=\"https://www.allaboutcookies.org/\">https://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>. In the case of third-party cookies for interest-based advertising, you can opt out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href=\"http://www.aboutads.info/choices/\">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> for web properties or at <a href=\"https://youradchoices.com/appchoices\">https://youradchoices.com/appchoices</a> for mobile apps. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user \u201cpreference signal\u201d referenced in the \u201cYour Rights and Choices\u201d section below, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the \u201csale\u201d of your information or the disclosure of your information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.<br>\u200d</p><h6><strong>Information we receive from third parties</strong></h6><p>We may receive information about you from third parties such as Researchers (for instance, when providing information about Researcher-Affiliated Participants), our users (for instance, a Participant who refers you to us), our business partners, data brokers, analytics providers, search information providers, and advertising, marketing, digital and social media agencies. We may also receive information about you from publicly accessible content, such as public databases or when you interact with us through social media platforms. We may combine the information collected from third-party sources with other information we collect about you.</p><p><br>If you choose to connect to our Services with one or more third-party social media or other accounts, we may receive and store certain information related to that account. This information may include your name, profile picture, your \u201clikes,\u201d and your list of friends, depending on your settings on such services. If you do not wish to have this information disclosed, do not use a social media connection to access the Services. For a description of how social media sites handle your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use. You may have the ability to control what information is disclosed from your linked social media account by adjusting the privacy settings for that account.<br>\u200d</p><h5><strong>Use of Your Information</strong></h5><p>Depending on how you interact with us, and with your prior consent where necessary, UI may use your personal data for the following purposes:<br>\u200d</p><p><strong>To operate and improve our business, </strong>including:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Enabling your use of the Services.</li><li>Performing any contract or other transaction we enter into with you.</li><li>Enhancing and personalizing the Services.</li><li>Developing new products and services.</li><li>Using the information for financial activities such as billing, auditing, and forecasting.</li><li>Conducting user research.&nbsp;</li><li>Performing data analytics for business purposes, including to understand usage and interaction trends and gather demographic insights about our users.</li></ul><p><strong>For general administrative purposes, </strong>including:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Notifying you about changes or updates to our Services.</li><li>Administering your account.</li><li>Sending you administrative communications related to the Services, such as communications related to Projects.</li><li>Responding to your inquiries, requests, or other communications.</li></ul><p><strong>For advertising and marketing purposes, </strong>including:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Marketing our Services to you, including by delivering commercial emails, newsletters, targeted advertising, and/or SMS messages.

Subject to applicable laws, we may use this aggregated or deidentified information for any purpose, including analytics purposes, such as developing and improving our Services, identifying industry trends and developments, and benchmarking. Where permitted by law, we may disclose such aggregated or deidentified information to any third-party entity or the public, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Services.<br>\u200d</p><h5><strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong></h5><p>We and our service providers may disclose your personal data as follows:</p><p><strong><br>With our service providers.</strong> We may provide access to or disclose your personal data with service providers that perform services on our behalf, including administrative, information technology, website and platform hosting, payment, business management, analytics, content management, lead generation, fraud prevention, and marketing services.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br>With other users of the Services.</strong> If you are a Recruit Participant and apply to or otherwise participate in a Project, your information will be made available to or disclosed to the Researcher that posted the Project. You expressly consent to the disclosure of such information to that Researcher, including any sensitive data that is included in your profile. If you are a Researcher and post a Project, your information may be disclosed to the Participants who are confirmed for your Project (depending on your preferences). In addition, the Services may enable you to disclose information directly through the Services (for example, through messaging features that enable you to interact with or disclose information with other users of the Services).</p><p><strong><br>With partner organizations and advertisers. </strong>The Services may integrate certain third-party plugins, widgets, or integrations that may collect information about you and may set and/or access a cookie or other tracking mechanism. Each plugin, widget, and integration is governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it, and not this Privacy Policy. We may also disclose your information to advertising partners and/or social media platforms that help us identify and reach our users and similar audiences, to serve ads, and/or provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br>For legal reasons or the protection of us and others.</strong> We may disclose your personal data if required by law or legal process or we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i)&nbsp;enforce our terms and conditions, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (ii)&nbsp;respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties, or (iii)&nbsp;to protect and defend our rights or property, to protect the safety or property of our users or the general public, to protect against legal liability, to prevent suspected fraud, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.</p><p><strong><br>For business transfers. </strong>In the event of sale (of some or all of our assets), transfer, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event involving our business (including in contemplation of such transactions), your information may be among the transferred business assets.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><p>We may also disclose your personal data to facilitate the potential or actual financing, securitization, bankruptcy, or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets. If such transfer or disclosure is subject to any mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, we will comply with those restrictions.</p><p><strong><br>With other unaffiliated third parties.</strong> We may also disclose your information to other unaffiliated third parties, including third party parties we collaborate with in connection with integration, co-marketing and certain other coordinated efforts and third parties whose offers we believe you may value.<br>\u200d</p><p><strong>With your consent. </strong>If you consent to our disclosure of your information, we will disclose your information consistent with your consent.<strong>&nbsp;<br>\u200d</strong></p><h5><strong>Links to Third-Party Sites and Services&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Our Services may contain links to third-party sites, tools, and integrations which are independent of UI. A link to any third-party site does not imply that we endorse or accept any responsibility for the content or use of such site. Similarly, Researchers may conduct Research Sessions or otherwise communicate with Participants via phone, email, videoconferencing, or other communication methods not provided, facilitated, or endorsed by UI. These third-party sites and technologies are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to review the privacy policies applicable to such third-party sites. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties or the content provided in their privacy policies.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><h5><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></h5><p>The security, integrity, and confidentiality of your personal data is important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. Please be aware that, although we strive to keep your personal data secure, no security measures are absolute.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><h5><strong>How Long We Keep Your Information</strong></h5><p>We retain your information for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes described above and as necessary to comply with legal requirements and obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests. The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information. For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes. If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. We may retain cached or archived copies of your information.<br>\u200d</p><h5><strong>Children\u2019s Personal Data</strong></h5><p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16 and do not target our Services to children under 16. If you are under 16, please do not use the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children\u2019s Internet usage and to help enforce this prohibition. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided information to us, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:support@userinterviews.com\">support@userinterviews.com</a>.<br>\u200d</p><h5><strong>Information for Users Outside the United States</strong></h5><p>The information that we collect is transferred to, stored in, accessed from, and processed in the United States or other jurisdictions in which we or our service providers maintain facilities for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. You understand that these jurisdictions may have different data protection regimes than in the country in which you are located. By using the site or Services, you consent to such transfer and processing of your information. Where legally required, we will use an adequate transfer method. For example, if we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area, we implement appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable law (such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses). If you need more information, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@userinterviews.com\">privacy@userinterviews.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><h5><strong><br>Your Rights and Choices&nbsp;</strong></h5><p><strong>Account Information and Consent</strong>. You may review and edit your account information in the Services at any time by logging into and updating your account. Where you have provided consent for us to use your information, you may request to withdraw that consent for future uses of your information.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><p><strong>Marketing Communications</strong>. You may always opt out of receiving future commercial email or SMS messages from us by following the opt-out instructions in emails or SMS messages we send you, or by emailing us at <a href=\"mailto:support@userinterviews.com\">support@userinterviews.com</a>. Please be aware that if you opt out of receiving commercial messages from us, consistent with our legal obligations, it may take us some time to process your opt-out request and you may receive commercial messages during that period. Even if you opt out of receiving commercial messages, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us, such as Project confirmations and details, updates to our policies and practices, or other communications regarding our relationship with you. We will not disclose mobile phone numbers collected solely through our SMS text programs to unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><p><strong>Identifying the Data Controller and Processor</strong>. Data protection laws in certain jurisdictions differentiate between the \u201ccontroller\u201d and \u201cprocessor\u201d of information. UI processes personal data both as a data controller and as a data processor. If you are a Researcher, Recruit Participant, or a visitor to our website, UI acts as a controller of your personal data. The categories of personal data we process, the purposes of our processing, and the categories of recipients with whom we may disclose your personal data are as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<br>\u200d</p><p>If you are a Researcher-Affiliated Participant, UI acts as a processor of your personal data. The purpose of such processing is to fulfill our contractual obligations with the Researcher with whom you are affiliated. We may disclose your personal data with certain subprocessors, identified here: <a href=\"https://www.userinterviews.com/legal/subprocessors?__hstc=753710.1e77a4fa39b9612c2b05e8fed2cce861.1740588320522.1740588320522.1740588320522.1&amp;__hssc=753710.1.1740588320522&amp;__hsfp=3618309378\">User Interviews Subprocessors</a>. If you are a Researcher-Affiliated Participant and wish to make a request related to your personal data, please contact the Researcher with whom you are affiliated. If you make such a request to us, we will inform the applicable Researcher of the request and will, if instructed by the Researcher, provide reasonable assistance to enable them to comply with the request, but we cannot respond to your request directly.<br>\u200d</p><p><strong>Legal Basis. </strong>The laws in some jurisdictions require us to disclose the legal grounds we rely on to process your information as a controller.

A link to any third-party site does not imply that we endorse or accept any responsibility for the content or use of such site. Similarly, Researchers may conduct Research Sessions or otherwise communicate with Participants via phone, email, videoconferencing, or other communication methods not provided, facilitated, or endorsed by UI. These third-party sites and technologies are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to review the privacy policies applicable to such third-party sites. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties or the content provided in their privacy policies.\u00a0\u200dHow We Protect Your InformationThe security, integrity, and confidentiality of your personal data is important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. Please be aware that, although we strive to keep your personal data secure, no security measures are absolute.\u00a0\u200dHow Long We Keep Your InformationWe retain your information for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes described above and as necessary to comply with legal requirements and obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests. The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information. For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes. If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. We may retain cached or archived copies of your information.\u200dChildren\u2019s Personal DataWe do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16 and do not target our Services to children under 16.

By using the site or Services, you consent to such transfer and processing of your information. Where legally required, we will use an adequate transfer method.

The laws in some jurisdictions require us to disclose the legal grounds we rely on to process your information as a controller. Our legal bases for processing your information as described in this Privacy Policy are as follows: (i)\u00a0where you have given consent to processing for one or more purposes; (ii)\u00a0where the processing is necessary to enter into or perform a contract you have entered into with us; (iii)\u00a0where the processing is necessary for our compliance with a legal obligation; or (iv)\u00a0where processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate business interests, unless such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\u200dRights Regarding Your Information.
