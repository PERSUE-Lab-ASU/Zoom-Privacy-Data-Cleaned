At Aule Group we have a few fundamental\n            principles:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              We never share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law,\n              develop our products, or protect our rights.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              We do not collect unnecessary personal information; only information your school\n              needs to best use Aule Group is stored.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to change your account information,\n              or deactivate your Aule Group account.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n\n          <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>\n          <p>\n            Aule Group (\"website\") operates at aule.co, and also at any sub directories\n            ([--].aule.co). It is Aule Group's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect,\n            or is provided by your school, while operating our websites.\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>Website Users</h4>\n          <p>\n            Due to the format of Aule Group's service, much of the information associated with your\n            account is inputted by your school's administrators. Additionally, like most website operators, Aule Group\n            collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make\n            available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each\n            visitor request. Aule\u2019s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand\n            how Aule\u2019s visitors use its website. From time to time, Aule Group may release non-personally-identifying\n            information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website, or by\n            making it available to teachers or school administrators.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Aule Group also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet\n            Protocol (IP) addresses. Aule Group does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and\n            does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses\n            personally-identifying information, as described below.\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>Use of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>\n          <p>\n            Aule Group's users interact with Aule Group in ways that require Aule Group to use personally-identifying\n            information. Login email addresses (provided to us by your school) identify who you are, and may be changed\n            at any time (these will never be disclosed to a third party, see below). Passwords are initially set to a\n            default, but may be willfully changed to suite you. Credit cards, addresses, and other such identifying\n            information is never collected. In each case, Aule Group collects such information only insofar as is\n            necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Aule Group. Aule Group\n            does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Aule Group's servers also collects potentially personally-identifying information like\n            Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

However, Aule Group does not disclose\n            personally-identifying information other than as described below.\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>\n          <p>\n            Aule Group discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying\n            information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know\n            that information in order to process it on Aule Group's behalf or to provide services available at Aule\n            Group's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,\n            contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Aule Group's\n            websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Aule Group will not rent or sell\n            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.

If you are a registered user of a Aule Group website\n            and have supplied your email address, Aule Group may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new\n            features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Aule Group and our\n            products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect\n            to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via\n            one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond\n            to your request or to help us support other users. Aule Group takes all measures reasonably necessary to\n            protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially\n            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>Data Retention</h4>\n          <p>\n            Aule Group retains your personal information for as long as it is necessary in order to\n            fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. We may retain your personal information for longer if it\n            turns out to be the subject of a legal claim, or may otherwise be relevant for future litigation.\n          </p>\n\n          <h4>Cookies</h4>\n          <p>\n            A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and\n            that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
