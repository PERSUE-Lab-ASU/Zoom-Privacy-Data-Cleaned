<p><strong>​Disclosure of Data</strong></p>

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards with respect to the protection of your privacy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the exercise of your rights. For example, if we transfer personal data from the EEA to a country outside it, such as the United States, we will implement an appropriate data transfer solution such as entering into EU standard contractual clauses with the data importer, or taking other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection under EU law.</p>
<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>Clovers will retain your personal data at least as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, comply with any laws or regulations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
