<p>1.4. The term “user” covers all categories of data subjects. They include our business partners, customers, interested parties, and other visitors to our online offer. The terms used, e.g. “user”, are to be understood in a gender-neutral way.</p>
<p>1.5. We process personal data of users only in compliance with the relevant data protection regulations. This means that user data will only be processed if a legal permission has been granted. This means, in particular, if the data processing is necessary for the provision of our contractual services (e.g. processing of orders), as well as online services, or is required by law, the consent of the users has been obtained, as well as on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation and security of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR, in particular in measuring reach, creating profiles for advertising and marketing purposes, as well as collecting access data and using the services of third parties.</p>

We only pass on user data to third parties if this is necessary for contractual purposes, e.g. on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR or on the basis of justified interests according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. GDPR in the economic and effective operation of our business.</p>
<p>3.2. If we use subcontractors to provide our services, we will take appropriate legal measures, as well as appropriate technical and organizational measures, to ensure the protection of personal data in accordance with the relevant legal provisions.</p>
<p>3.3. If, in the context of this privacy policy, content, tools, or other means are used by other providers (hereinafter jointly referred to as “Third Party Providers”) and their registered office is located in a third country, it is to be assumed that a data transfer to the countries where the Third Party Providers are located will take place. Third countries are understood to be countries in which the GDPR is not a directly applicable law, i.e. in principle countries outside the EU or the European Economic Area. The transfer of data to third countries takes place either if an appropriate level of data protection, user consent, or other legal permission has been obtained.</p>
<h2>4. Provision of Contractual Services</h2>
<p>4.1. We process inventory data (e.g. names and addresses, as well as contact data of users), contract data (e.g. services used, names of contact persons, payment information) for the purpose of fulfilling our contractual obligations, and services in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit b. GDPR.</p>
<p>4.2. Users can optionally create a user account where they can especially view their orders. During the registration process, users are provided with the required mandatory data. The user accounts are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. A user account can also be created within the software distributed or developed by us. Especially here in the iOSXpert PluginCenter If users have canceled their user account, their data will be deleted with regard to the user account, subject to their safekeeping is necessary for commercial or tax law reasons according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. It is the responsibility of the users to back up their data before the end of the contract if they have terminated it. We are entitled to irretrievably delete all of the user’s data stored during the term of the contract.</p>
<p>4.3. In the context of registration and renewed logins, as well as the use of our online services and our Daylite extensions, will save the IP address and the time of the respective user action. The storage is based on our legitimate interests, as well as the user to protect against abuse and other unauthorized use. This data will not be passed on to third parties unless it is necessary to pursue our claims or there is a legal obligation to do so in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.</p>
<p>4.4. We process usage data (e.g. the visited websites of our online offer, interest in our products) and content data (e.g., entries in the contact form or user profile) for advertising purposes in a user profile in order to show the user e.g. product information based on the services they have used so far.</p>
<h2>5. Contacting</h2>
<p>5.1. When contacting us (via contact form or e-mail), the user’s data will be processed for the purpose of handling the contact request and its processing in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
<p>5.2. The information provided by users may be stored in our Customer Relationship Management System (“CRM System”) or a comparable request organization.</p>
<p>5.3. We use the CRM system “Daylite”, from the provider Marcetcircle Inc, 30 Centurian Drive, Suite 201, Markham, Ontario L3R8B8, Canada, based on our legitimate interests (efficient and fast processing of user requests). For this purpose, we have concluded a contract with Marketcircle with so-called standard contractual clauses, in which Marketcircle undertakes to process user data only in accordance with our instructions and to comply with the EU data protection level.</p>
<p>5.4.&nbsp;If you sign up for a Marketcircle product using a link provided by us, we may share contact data with Marketcircle Inc. for the purpose of customer acquisition and customer support (name and e-mail address).</p>
<p>5.5.&nbsp;For the abovementioned purposes we process such data as joint controllers together with Markcircle (Art. 26 GDPR) and therefore have concluded a joint controllership agreement with them. If you want to exercise your data subjects’ rights under the GDPR you may contact both Marketcircle or us. Marketcircle is responsible for the fulfilment of your data subjects’ rights according to the data protection agreement concluded with us.</p>
<h2>6. Comments and Contributions</h2>
<p>6.1. If users leave comments or other contributions, their IP addresses will be deleted on the basis of our legitimate interests as defined in article 6 paragraph 1 letter f. GDPR for 7 days.</p>
<p>6.2. This is done for our safety in case someone leaves illegal content in comments and contributions (insults, prohibited political propaganda, etc.). In this case, we can be prosecuted for the comment or contribution and are therefore interested in the identity of the author.</p>
<h2>7. Collection of Access Data and Log Files</h2>
<p>7.1. We raise on the basis of our legitimate interests as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR data about every access to the server on which this service is located (so-called server log files). The access data includes the name of the accessed website, file, date and time of access, transferred data volume, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user’s operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited site), IP address and the requesting provider. This data may also be collected when using our plugins and our PluginCenter.</p>
<p>7.2. Logfile information will be stored for a maximum of seven days for security reasons (e.g. to investigate abuse or fraud) and then deleted. Data whose further storage is required for evidentiary purposes is exempt from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.</p>
<h2>8. Cookies &amp; Range Measurement</h2>
<p>8.1. Cookies are information that is transferred from our web server or web servers of third parties to the web browsers of users and stored there for later retrieval. Cookies can be small files or other types of information storage.</p>
<p>8.2. We use “session cookies”, which are only stored for the duration of your current visit to our online presence (e.g. to enable the storage of your login status or the shopping cart function and thus the use of our online offer at all). A randomly generated, unique identification number, a so-called session ID, is stored in a session cookie. A cookie also contains information about its origin and the storage period. These cookies cannot store any other data. Session cookies are deleted when you have finished using our online services and, for example, log out or close the browser.</p>
<p>8.3. The users will be informed about the use of cookies within the scope of pseudonymous range measurement within the scope of this data protection declaration.</p>
<p>8.4. If users do not want cookies to be stored on their computer, they are asked to deactivate the corresponding option in the system settings of their browser. Stored cookies can be deleted in the system settings of the browser. The exclusion of cookies can lead to functional limitations of this online offer.</p>
<p>8.5. You can object to the use of cookies for audience measurement and advertising purposes via the deactivation page of the network advertising initiative (<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/</a>) and additionally the US website (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>) or the European website (<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices/</a>).</p>
<h2>9. Google Analytics</h2>
<p>9.1. Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR) Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the website by the user is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
<p>9.2. Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participantid=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a>).</p>
<p>9.3. Google will use this information on our behalf in order to evaluate the use of our website by users, to compile reports on the activities within this website, and to provide us with further services associated with the use of this website and the use of the Internet. The processed data can be used to create pseudonymous user profiles of the users.</p>
<p>9.4. We use Google Analytics only with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of users is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.</p>
<p>9.5. The IP address transmitted by the user’s browser will not be merged with other data from Google. Users can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting their browser software accordingly; users can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to their use of the online offer to Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available under the following link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>. Even on mobile devices, you can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent the collection of your data during future visits to this website: [google_analytics_optout]Click here for opt-out.[/google_analytics_optout]</p>
<p>9.6. Further information on the use of data by Google, setting and contradiction possibilities you will find on the websites of Google: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners</a> (“Data use by Google in your use of websites or apps of our partners”), <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a> (“Data use for advertising purposes”), <a href="http://www.google.de/settings/ads">http://www.google.de/settings/ads</a> (“Manage information that Google uses to show you advertising”).<a name="_Toc469863326"></a></p>
<h2>10. Google-Re/Marketing-Services</h2>
<p>10.1. We use on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR the marketing and remarketing services (in short “Google Marketing Services”) of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”).</p>
<p>10.2. Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participantid=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a>). Google’s marketing services allow us to better target advertisements for and on our website to show users only those ads that potentially match their interests. For example, if a user is shown ads for products that he or she has been interested in on other websites, this is called “remarketing”. For these purposes, when users access our and other websites on which Google marketing services are active, a code is executed directly by Google and so-called (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as “web beacons”) are embedded in the website. With their help, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the user’s device (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used). The cookies can be set by various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com. This file records which websites the user has visited, what content he is interested in, and which offers he has clicked on, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time, and other information about the use of the online offer. The IP address of the user is also recorded, whereby we inform within the framework of Google Analytics that the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and only in exceptional cases is it transferred in full to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address is not merged with User data within other Google offers. Google may also combine the above-mentioned information with information from other sources. If the user subsequently visits other websites, the ads tailored to his interests can be displayed to him.</p>
<p>10.3. User data is processed pseudonymously within the framework of Google marketing services. This means that Google does not store and process the name or e-mail address of the user, for example, but processes the relevant data on a cookie-related basis within pseudonymous user profiles. I.e. from Google’s point of view, the ads are not managed and displayed for a specifically identified person, but for the cookie holder, regardless of who that cookie holder is. This does not apply if a user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected by Google’s marketing services about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the USA.</p>
<p>10.4. The Google marketing services we use include the online advertising program “Google AdWords”. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer receives a different “conversion cookie”. Cookies can therefore not be tracked through the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected through the cookie is used to compile conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted into conversion tracking. AdWords advertisers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ads and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that personally identifies users.</p>
<p>10.5. We can integrate third-party advertisements based on the Google marketing service “DoubleClick”. DoubleClick uses cookies to enable Google and its partner sites to serve ads based on users’ visits to this site or other sites on the Internet.</p>
<p>10.6. We can integrate third-party advertisements on the basis of the Google marketing service “AdSense”. AdSense uses cookies to enable Google and its partner websites to serve ads based on users’ visits to this website or other websites on the Internet.</p>
<p>10.7. We can also use the service “Google Optimizer”. Google Optimizer allows us in the context of so-called “A/B-Testings” to understand how various changes to a website affect it (e.g. changes in input fields, design, etc.). For these test purposes, cookies are stored on the users’ devices. Only pseudonymous data of the users are processed.</p>
<p>10.8. We may also use the “Google Tag Manager” to integrate and manage the Google analysis and marketing services into our website.</p>
<p>10.9. Further information on Google’s use of data for marketing purposes can be found on the overview page: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads</a>, Google’s privacy policy is available at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>.</p>
<p>10.10. If you wish to object to the interest-based advertising by Google marketing services, you can use the setting and opt-out options provided by Google: <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences</a>.</p>
<h2>11. Facebook Social Plugins</h2>
<p>11.1. We use on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR) Social Plugins (“Plugins”) of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd., Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”). The Plugins can display interaction elements or content (e.g. videos, graphics, or text contributions) and can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white “f” on blue tile, the words “Like”, “Like” or a “thumbs up” sign) or are marked with the addition “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list and appearance of the Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.</p>
<p>11.2. When a user accesses a function of this online offering that contains such a plugin, their device establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to the user’s device and integrated into the online offering. User profiles can be created from the processed data. We therefore have no influence on the scope of the data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore inform users according to our level of knowledge.</p>
<p>11.3. By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has called up the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged into Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his or her Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example, by pressing the Like button or making a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted directly from your device to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, it is still possible for Facebook to find out his or her IP address and store it. According to Facebook, only an anonymized IP address is stored in Germany.</p>
<p>11.4. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as the related rights and setting options to protect the privacy of users can be found in Facebook’s data protection information: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/</a>.</p>
<p>11.5. If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Meta to collect data about him/her via this online offer and link it with his/her membership data stored on Facebook, he/she must log out of Facebook and delete his/her cookies before using our online offer. Further settings and objections to the use of data for advertising purposes are possible within the Facebook profile settings: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a> or via the US page <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or the EU page <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>. The settings are platform-independent, i.e. they are applied to all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.</p>
<h2>12. Facebook, Custom Audiences, and Facebook Marketing Services</h2>
<p>12.1. Within our online offer, due to our legitimate interests in analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our online offer and for these purposes, the so-called “Facebook pixel” of the social network Facebook, which is operated by Meta Platforms Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you are located in the EU, Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”), is used.</p>
<p>12.2. With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is on the one hand able to determine the visitors of our online offer as a target group for the presentation of ads (so-called “Facebook Ads”). Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel in order to display the Facebook Ads placed by us only to those Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our online offering or who exhibit certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products determined on the basis of the websites visited) that we transmit to Facebook (so-called “custom audiences”). With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to ensure that our Facebook-Ads correspond to the potential interest of users and do not appear to be annoying. The Facebook pixel also enables us to track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users are redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called “conversion”).</p>
<p>12.3. The Facebook pixel is directly integrated by Facebook when you call up our websites and can store a so-called cookie, i.e. a small file on your device. If you then log in to Facebook or visit Facebook while logged in, the visit to our online offer will be noted in your profile. The data collected about you is anonymous to us, so we cannot draw conclusions about the identity of the user. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and can be used by Facebook as well as for our own market research and advertising purposes. If we send data to Facebook for comparison purposes, it is encrypted locally on the browser and only then sent to Facebook via a secure https connection. This is done solely for the purpose of comparing the data with the data similarly encrypted by Facebook.</p>
<p>12.4. Furthermore, when using the Facebook pixel, we use the additional function “extended matching” (here, data such as telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, or Facebook IDs of users) to create target groups (“Custom Audiences” or “Look Alike Audiences”) and send them to Facebook (encrypted). Further notes on “extended matching”: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668">https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668</a>).</p>
<p>12.5. Also based on our legitimate interests, we use the “Custom Audiences from File” procedure of the social network Facebook. in this case, the email addresses of the newsletter recipients are uploaded to Facebook. The upload process is encrypted. The upload is used solely to determine recipients of our Facebook ads. We want to make sure that the ads are only shown to users who have an interest in our information and services.</p>
<p>12.6. The processing of the data by Facebook is carried out within the framework of Meta’s Data Use Policy.

<h2>13. Newsletter</h2>
<p>13.1. With the following information, we would like to clarify the contents of our newsletter as well as the registration, dispatch, and statistical evaluation procedures and your rights of objection. By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to receive it and to the described procedures.</p>
<p>13.2. Content of the newsletter: We send newsletters, e-mails, and other electronic notifications containing advertising information (hereinafter “newsletter”) only with the consent of the recipients or legal permission. If the contents of the newsletter are specifically described in the context of a registration, they are decisive for the consent of the users. In addition, our newsletters contain information about our products, offers, campaigns, and our company.</p>
<p>13.3. Double-Opt-In and logging: The registration to our newsletter is done in a so-called Double-Opt-In procedure. This means that you will receive an e-mail after registration asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with foreign e-mail addresses. The newsletter registrations are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as well as the IP address. Changes to your data stored by the shipping service provider are also logged.</p>
<p>13.4. Dispatch service provider: The dispatch of the newsletter is carried out by means of e3 Software, Lcc, 465 Fairchild Drive, #229 Mountain View, CA 94043, hereinafter referred to as “dispatch service provider”. The privacy policy of the shipping service provider can be viewed here: <a href="https://directmailmac.com/privacy">https://directmailmac.com/privacy </a></p>
<p>13.5. Furthermore, according to its own information, the dispatch service provider may use this data in pseudonymous form, i.e. without allocation to a user, to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. for the technical optimization of the dispatch and presentation of the newsletter or for statistical purposes to determine from which countries the recipients come. However, the dispatch service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them itself or pass them on to third parties.</p>
<p>13.6. Login data: To subscribe to the newsletter, you only need to enter your e-mail address and a name to be addressed personally in the newsletter.</p>
<p>13.7. Statistical survey and analysis – The newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”, i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server of the mailing service provider when the newsletter is opened. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information, such as information on the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are initially collected. This information is used for the technical improvement of the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined by means of the IP address) or the access times. Statistical surveys also include determining whether newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our nor the dispatch service provider’s intention to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our contents to them or to send different contents according to the interests of our users.</p>
<p>13.8 The use of the mailing service provider, the performance of statistical surveys and analyses as well as the logging of the registration process are based on our legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We are interested in using a user-friendly and secure newsletter system that serves our business interests and meets the expectations of users.</p>
<p>13.9. Cancellation/revocation – You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent. Your consent to its dispatch by the dispatch service provider and the statistical analyses will expire at the same time. A separate cancellation of the dispatch by the dispatch service provider or the statistical analysis is unfortunately not possible. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter at the end of each newsletter. If the users have only registered for the newsletter and canceled this registration, their personal data will be deleted, unless they have been stored in our CRM in a legitimate way by another type of business relationship.</p>
<h2>14. Integration of Third-Party Services and Content</h2>
<p>14.1. We set within our online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use content or service offers from third parties in order to integrate their content and services, such as videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as “content”). This always presupposes that the third-party providers of such content are aware of the IP address of the users, as without the IP address they would not be able to send the content to their browsers. The IP address is therefore necessary for the display of this content. We make every effort to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address only to deliver the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. The “pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and may contain, among other things, technical information on the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visiting time, and other details on the use of our online offer, as well as being able to be linked to such information from other sources.</p>
