<p><strong>5. No Collection of Information from Children </strong></p>
<p>Our Platform and Websites are not intended for use by children under 13 years of age.

<p><strong>7. Cross-Border Transfer </strong></p>
<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed outside your country of residence in the United States or another country that may not be regarded as ensuring an adequate level of protection for personal information under the data protection laws in your country of residence. There are potential risks to you associated with transferring your information to other countries due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards. These risks include the risk that you will not be able to exercise your data protection rights under applicable law to protect yourself from unlawful use or disclosure of your information. The data protection and privacy laws of certain countries may not afford you the same level of protection as those in your own country. Where this is the case we will transfer the personal information where we are satisfied that there are comparable levels of protection equivalent to your country of residence by using a legitimate transfer mechanism to the extent required under applicable laws, such as pursuant to standard contractual clauses.</p>
<p><strong>8. Data Security </strong></p>
<p>We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted through our Platform and Websites. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Platform and Websites.</p>
<p><strong>9. Data Retention </strong></p>
<p>Creative MediaWorks will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law or defined in an agreement. We may retain personal information for longer where required by our regulatory obligations or professional indemnity obligations, or where we believe it is necessary to establish, defend or protect our legal rights and interests or those of others. We do not retain financial information after processing it for the purpose for which we collected it.</p>
<p>Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.</p>
<p><strong>10. Changes to Privacy Policy </strong></p>
<p>We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You may check this effective date to determine whether there have been changes since the last time you reviewed the Privacy Policy. We will notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy by posting the revised Privacy Policy on our websites.

    <p>Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed outside your country of residence in the United States or another country that may not be regarded as ensuring an adequate level of protection for personal information under the data protection laws in your country of residence.  There are potential risks to you associated with transferring your information to other countries due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards.  These risks include the risk that you will not be able to exercise your data protection rights under applicable law to protect yourself from unlawful use or disclosure of your information.  The data protection and privacy laws of certain countries may not afford you the same level of protection as those in your own country.  Where this is the case we will transfer the personal information where we are satisfied that there are comparable levels of protection equivalent to your country of residence by using a legitimate transfer mechanism to the extent required under applicable laws, such as pursuant to standard contractual clauses.</p>
