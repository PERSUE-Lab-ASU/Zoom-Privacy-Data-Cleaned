PRIVACY SHIELD</span></h2><p class="c12"><span class="c8">PlayPosit complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. PlayPosit has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, PlayPosit is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. For purposes of Article 14(2) of the GDPR, PlayPosit relies on the following lawful basis for processing Personal Data: consent, compliance with law and legitimate interest. PlayPosit complies with applicable law, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c8">We may also share your personally identifiable information with law enforcement officials, or other third parties, when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure.

More information about JAMS is available at https://www.jamsadr.com. Further, If PlayPosit does not resolve the complaint, you can submit the matter to binding arbitration to a single arbitrator of the Privacy Shield Panel.
