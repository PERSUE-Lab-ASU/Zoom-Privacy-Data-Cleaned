      <p class="mb-4"><strong><em>Automatically Collected Information</em></strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4">Most of the data we collect in and through the Site and the Services is technical in nature
        and is collected and processed automatically through so-called application programming

        your voice, chat, uploaded media and other actions will be seen, heard, and otherwise made

        private any information that you disclose to other users. You should exercise caution when
        deciding to disclose Personal Information through the use of the Services.

      <p class="mb-4">The Services may include links to third party websites and social media services where you
        will be able to post comments, stories, reviews or other information. Your use of these
        third party websites and social media services may result in the collection or sharing of

        you to review the privacy policies and settings on the third party websites and social media
        services with which you interact to make sure you understand the information that may be

      <p class="mb-4"><strong><em>How We Use Cookies and Other Technologies</em></strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4">Some of the features on the Site and the Services require the use of "cookies" - small text
        files that are stored on your device’s hard drive. We use cookies to measure which
        pages are being accessed, and which features are most frequently used. This enables us to
        continuously improve the Site to meet the needs of our visitors.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">The following sets out how we may use different categories of cookies and your options for
        managing cookie settings:

      <ul><li><h4>Required cookies</h4>
          <p class="mb-4">Required cookies enable you to navigate the Site and use their features, such as
            accessing secure areas of the Site and using the Services. If you have chosen to
            identify yourself to us, we use cookies containing encrypted information to allow us to
            uniquely identify you. These cookies allow us to uniquely identify you when you are

            after logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to
            text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. We may use local

        similar means in connection with the Services and HTML-formatted email messages to, among
        other things, track the actions of users, to determine the success of marketing campaigns
        and to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Third Parties We Share Personal Information With</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">We may disclose Personal Information you provide to us or that we collect automatically on
        the Site and in and through the Services with the following categories of third parties:
      </p>
      <ul><li>Service providers, such as payment processors, web hosting and data storage service
          providers, marketing service providers, and communications service providers which help us
          deliver and develop the Services;
        </li>

        <li>Public authorities, such as law enforcement, if we are legally required to do so or if we
          need to protect our rights or the rights of third parties; and
        </li>

        <li>Our subsidiaries and affiliates; or a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Site
          and/or the Services and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger,
          consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets, or
          in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization, in
          accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        </li></ul>

      <li><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">We make content or services from other websites available to you from links located on the
        Site. We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links
        have been followed. In addition, you may opt to link your Account to your social media
        account or other accounts, such as Zoom, in accordance with your Account settings (which you
        may change at any time) and respective policies of these third parties. This Privacy Policy
        applies only to the Site and the Services. We do not exercise control over third party
        services or other websites that provide information, or links from within the Site or the
        Services. Your interactions with these third party services are governed by the privacy
        policy of the company providing it. These other sites and services may place their own
        cookies or other files on your computer’s browser, collect data or solicit Personal
        Information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use
        or disclosure of the Personal Information that you submit, and the collection and use of
        such information and access of any third party websites are subject to such third
        party’s privacy policy. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and other terms
        of such third parties before using their services.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Security</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">We understand the importance of privacy and security of Personal Information to our users
        and have made them a priority. Sesh uses security technologies and procedures to help
        protect Personal Information about you from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
        However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome
        those measures or use your Personal Information for improper purposes, and we do not promise
        that Personal Information about you or private communications will be protected from
        unauthorized disclosure or use.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">Sesh does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide
        targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However,
        some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you
        content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Managing Your Privacy</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">We keep your data on your behalf and for your benefit. You can correct or terminate and
        delete your Account information by following the instructions on the Services or by e-mail
        at
        <a class="underline" href="mailto:support@sesh.com">support@sesh.com</a>, which you may also
        access for further assistance and questions regarding the Privacy Policy or for a copy of
        your Account data. If you cancel your Account or request us to delete your information, Sesh
        will limit its access to Personal Information to perform what is requested by you and will
        delete information accessible to Sesh within seven business days.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Your Rights</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">We take steps to help ensure that you are able to exercise your rights regarding Personal
        Information about you in accordance with applicable law. If you would like to access,
        review, erase, withdraw your consent, or object to, or restrict the processing of Personal
        Data we collect about you, you may submit a request to
        <a class="underline" href="mailto:support@sesh.com">support@sesh.com</a>. We will promptly
        review all such requests in accordance with applicable laws. Depending on where you live,
        you may also have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority or other
        regulatory agency if you believe that we have violated any of the rights concerning Personal
        Information about you. We encourage you to first reach out to us at
        <a class="underline" href="mailto:support@sesh.com">support@sesh.com</a>, so we have an
        opportunity to address your concerns directly before you do so.
      </p>

      <li><strong>California Residents</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires certain businesses that share customer
        Personal Information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing
        purposes to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’
        practices related to such information-sharing. We currently do not share or disclose your
        Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing
        purposes. If we change our practices in the future, we will implement an opt-out policy as
        required under California laws.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">Furthermore, subject to certain exemptions, California residents have the following rights
        with respect to Personal Information we may have collected about them:
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong><em>Requests to Know</em></strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4">You have the right to request that we disclose:</p>
      <ul><li>The categories of Personal Information we have collected about you;</li>
        <li>The categories of Personal Information about you we have sold or disclosed for a business
          purpose;
        </li>
        <li>The categories of sources from which we have collected Personal Information about you;
        </li>
        <li>The business or commercial purposes for selling or collecting Personal Information about
          you;
        </li>
        <li>The categories of Personal Information sold or shared, if any, about you, as well as the
          categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold, by category of
          Personal Information for each party to whom Personal Information was sold; and
        </li>
        <li>The specific pieces of Personal Information collected.</li></ul>
      <p class="mb-4">You may submit a request to know via
        <a href="/request-information">https://sesh.com/request-information </a>. The delivery of
        our response may take place electronically or by mail. We are not required to respond to
        requests to know more than twice in a 12-month period. We do not sell, and have not in the
        prior 12 months sold, Personal Information about California residents. Therefore, we have
        not included a "Do Not Sell My Personal Info" link on our Site. If our practices change, we
        will update this Privacy Policy and take any other necessary action to comply with
        applicable law. We do, however, disclose Personal Information for business purposes as
        described in the "Third Parties We Share Personal Information With" section above.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong><em>Requests to Delete</em></strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4">You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information about you that we have
        collected. Upon receiving a verified request to delete Personal Information, we will do so
        unless otherwise required or authorized by law. You may submit a request to delete Personal
        Information via
        <a href="/request-delete">https://sesh.com/request-delete </a>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong><em>Authorized Agents</em></strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4">You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. You must provide an
        authorized agent written permission to submit a request on your behalf, and we may require
        that you verify your identity directly with us. Alternatively, an authorized agent that has
        been provided power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000-4465 may submit a
        request on your behalf.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong><em>Methods for Submitting Consumer Requests and Our Response to Requests</em></strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4">You may submit a request for access and requests to delete Personal Information about you
        via:
      </p>

        </li>
        <li><a href="/request-delete">https://sesh.com/request-delete </a>, or

        <li>via email at
          <a class="underline" href="mailto:support@sesh.com">support@sesh.com</a></li></ul>
      <p class="mb-4">Upon receipt of a request, we may ask you for additional information to verify your
        identity. Any additional information you provide will be used only to verify your identity
        and not for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">We will acknowledge the receipt of your request within 10 days of receipt. Subject to our
        ability to verify your identity, we will respond to your request within 45 days of receipt.
        If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension
        period in writing. In order to protect your privacy and the security of Personal Information
        about you, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request. In some cases
        we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity such as a government
        issued ID.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
        consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we
        cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it
        is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants
        a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate
        before completing your request.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong><em>The Right to Non-Discrimination</em></strong></p>
      <p class="mb-4">You have the right not to be discriminated against for the exercise of your California
        privacy rights described above. Unless permitted by the California Consumer Privacy Act ("<strong>CCPA</strong>"), we will not:
      </p>
      <ul><li>Deny you goods or services;</li>

        <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting
          discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
        </li>

        <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or</li>

        <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a
          different level or quality of goods or services.
        </li></ul>

      <li><strong>International Transfers of Personal Information</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">Sesh is based in the United States. As a result, Personal Information that we collect in and
        through the Services and on the Site may be transferred to our U.S. offices. In addition, we
        may work with third-party service providers in the U.S. and in other countries to support
        our business activities. Thus, Personal Information may be transferred to, stored on servers
        in, and accessed from the United States and countries other than the country in which the
        Personal Information was initially collected. In all such instances, we use, transfer, and
        disclose Personal Information solely for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice and
        in compliance with applicable laws.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Data Retention</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">We keep Personal Information related to your Account for as long as it is needed to fulfill
        the purposes for which it was collected, to provide our services, to deal with possible
        legal claims, to comply with our business interests and/or to abide by all applicable laws.
        Thereafter, we either delete Personal Information about you or de-identify it. Please note
        that even if you request the deletion of Personal Information about you, we may be required
        (by law or otherwise) to retain the Personal Information and not delete it. However, once
        those requirements are removed, we will delete Personal Information about you in accordance
        with your request.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></li>
      <p class="mb-4">Our security and Privacy Policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This
        Privacy Policy might change as we update and expand the Services. You can tell when this
        Privacy Policy was last updated by reviewing the Last Updated-legend on top of this page. We
        will endeavor to notify you of these changes by email, but will not be liable for any
        failure to do so. We also encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. If you
        do not understand any of the terms or conditions of any of our policies, you may inquire
        regarding the same via email at
        <a class="underline" href="mailto:support@sesh.com">support@sesh.com</a>. Your continued use
        of the Services after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of
