<h3 style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Legal basis of processing where OnceHub acts as a controller under the GDPR</strong></h3>
<p>If you are from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and processing your Customer Data described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will only collect personal information from you where either;</p>
<ul>
<li>We have your consent to do so;</li>
<li>Where processing of your personal information is necessary to take steps to enter into a contract, or perform a contract, with you;</li>
<li>Where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms; or</li>
<li>In certain situations, where we have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about, or need further information concerning, the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact our Data Protection Officer&nbsp;by using the contact form on our <a href="/trustcenter/rights" rel="noopener">your rights</a> page.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Your rights under the GDPR</strong></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The right to find out what personal data of yours we are processing</span></p>
<p>This is known as the right of access.&nbsp; This right allows you to ask for details of the personal information we hold on you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The right to change or update your information</span></p>
<p>This is called the right to rectification.&nbsp; You can ask us to correct anything that you think is wrong with the personal information that we hold about you.&nbsp; If you have a OnceHub account you can update your personal details and information in your account settings.&nbsp; Otherwise you can contact us with details of the changes you wish to make and we will do it for you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The right to restrict how your information is used</span></p>
<p>In certain circumstances you have the right to restrict the way we process your personal data.&nbsp; The right is not an absolute right, and it depends on the type of personal data we hold and the legal basis on which we process it.&nbsp; To exercise this right, you will need to contact us, providing us with details and we will respond to you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The right to move your data</span></p>
<p>This is called the right to data portability.&nbsp; You can ask us to supply you with the information that we hold on you in an electronic format.&nbsp; If you wish to exercise this right then please contact us and we will make arrangements to provide you with this information.&nbsp; Please be aware that we may require some identification to check that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The right to stop us from processing your data</span></p>
<p>This is called the right to object and you can exercise it in a few different ways.</p>
<p>You can object to us sending you marketing information and to do this you should click on the Unsubscribe link that you can find at the bottom of any of the marketing emails that we send you.</p>
<p>If you wish to object to us processing your data for any other reason then you should contact us and give us details of what it is you object to and why you want us to stop processing your personal data.&nbsp; Bear in mind that this is not an absolute right, and there may be valid reasons why we can continue to process your data, but we will explain the reasons for that in detail if it applies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The right to have your data deleted</span></p>
<p>This is called the right to erasure and means that you can ask for your personal information to be deleted.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, or your account is terminated for payment failure, we delete your data in accordance with our data retention policies, details of which are set out below, otherwise if you wish to make a request to delete your data then please contact us.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is not possible to delete your data, for instance if we have a valid legal basis for keeping it, but if that’s the case we will let you know.&nbsp; Please be aware that we may require some identification to check that you are who you say you are.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Information from children</strong></h3>
<p>We do not knowingly permit children to sign up for a OnceHub account.&nbsp; If we discover someone who is underage has signed up for a OnceHub account, we will take reasonable steps to promptly remove that person’s personal information from our records.&nbsp; If you believe a person who is underage has signed up for a OnceHub account, please contact our Data Protection Officer&nbsp;by using the contact form on our <a href="/trustcenter/rights" rel="noopener">your rights</a> page.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>International transfers</strong></h3>
<p>Your personal data will be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and to other countries where we or our third-party service providers operate as set out on our subprocessors page.</p>
<p>OnceHub employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.&nbsp; In cases where the personal data is transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom or Switzerland to a country outside of the European Union, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, that is not deemed to have adequate data protection provisions by the EU Commission, we rely on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to comply with EU Law.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Data Protection Officer</strong></h3>
