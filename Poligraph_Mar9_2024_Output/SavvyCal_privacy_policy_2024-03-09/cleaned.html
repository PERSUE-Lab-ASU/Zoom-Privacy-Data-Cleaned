      </p>
      <p>This privacy notice for SavvyCal, Inc. (“SavvyCal”, “we”, or “us”), describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and process personal data.</p>
<p>Here are a few terms you’ll find throughout this notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SavvyCal website (“Website” or “Services”) refers to all information, software, and plug-ins (including SavvyCal for Chrome) made available to you,</li>
<li>SavvyCal “Users” are people who have registered for an account,</li>
<li>SavvyCal “Schedulers” are people who have booked a meeting with a User, but may not have registered for an account of their own, and</li>
<li>SavvyCal “Viewers” are people who visit the Website, buy may not be a User or Scheduler.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any terms defined in the&nbsp;<a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/eula">End User License Agreement</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="/dpa">Data Processing Addendum</a>&nbsp;and not otherwise defined in this Privacy Notice are hereby adopted by reference in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-collect-your-information" tabindex="-1">How We Collect Your Information</h2>
<p>We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register as a SavvyCal User,</li>
<li>Use our services as a SavvyCal Scheduler,</li>
<li>Express interest in obtaining information about us, or</li>
<li>Otherwise contact us.</li>
</ul>
<p>The personal information we collect may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names</li>
<li>Email addresses</li>
<li>Passwords</li>
<li>Contact preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>We may combine information automatically collected with other information we collected about you including from publicly available sources. We do not process any sensitive information (as per the GDPR Article 9). We do not rent, buy, or sell personal information.</p>
<p>As a User, you may connect your calendars, video conferencing providers, and other third-party applications to your SavvyCal account. When you connect a calendar, we only query events from calendars of your choosing to determine when you are busy and to display your events to you when viewing the scheduling interface. We do not store any details about your calendar events. When you connect a video conferencing provider, we may create meeting rooms on your behalf and attach information for joining the conferencing session to SavvyCal events.</p>
<p>If you purchase a paid version of SavvyCal, our payment processor (Stripe) will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. You may find their <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">privacy notice here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="legal-basis-for-processing" tabindex="-1">Legal Basis For Processing</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.</li>
<li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
<li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-share-your-information" tabindex="-1">How We Share Your Information</h2>
<p>We may share your information with trusted parties in order to deliver our products and services to you. These parties include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data processors (see the <a href="/data-processors">list of providers we use</a>)</li>
<li>Legal professionals</li>
<li>Our accountant</li>
<li>IT support</li>
<li>Public authorities (when we are required to report to them)</li>
</ul>
<p>We require these parties to agree to take reasonable steps to keep the Personal Data that we provide to them secure. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your Personal Data except in connection with providing their services.</p>
<p>We do not sell your information to any third parties or disclose it in exchange for money or other valuable consideration. We do not share your Personal Data with others except as indicated within this Notice, or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt-out of having your Personal Data shared.</p>

<h2 id="transfer-of-data-internationally" tabindex="-1">Transfer Of Data Internationally</h2>
<p>Our application and database servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing SavvyCal from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information in the United States, and other countries.</p>
<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>
<p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Data Processing Addendum that includes Standard Contractual Clauses is available here: <a href="https://savvycal.com/dpa">https://savvycal.com/dpa</a>. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>
<h2 id="your-privacy-rights" tabindex="-1">Your Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access and obtain a copy of your personal information,</li>
<li>Request rectification or erasure,</li>
<li>Restrict the processing of your personal information,</li>
<li>In certain circumstances, transfer your data to you or an other organization, and</li>
<li>In certain circumstances, object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with these laws. If you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">local data protection supervisory authority</a>. If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">available here</a>. We encourage you to reach out to us first so we can work to resolve the matter with you.</p>
<h3 id="your-account" tabindex="-1">Your Account</h3>
<p>In order to keep your Personal Data accurate and complete, you can log in to review and update your account information, including contact and billing information, via your account settings page. We will do our best to honor your requests subject to any legal and contractual obligations. If you would like to make a request, cancel your account or request we delete or no longer use your account information to provide you our Website, contact us at&nbsp;support@savvycal.com.</p>
<h3 id="promotional-email" tabindex="-1">Promotional Email</h3>
<p>You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us at support@savvycal.com. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related, transactional messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
<h3 id="cookies" tabindex="-1">Cookies</h3>
<p>You may also refrain from providing or may withdraw your consent for Cookies via your browser settings. Your browser’s help function should contain instructions on how to set your computer to accept all Cookies, to notify you when a Cookie is issued, or to not receive Cookies at any time. Please keep in mind that Cookies are required to authenticate SavvyCal Users as well as perform some actions within SavvyCal (such as to pay for an event as an Scheduler via SavvyCal), so in order to use the Website, some Cookies are often required. For further information, see our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="security-measures" tabindex="-1">Security Measures</h2>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. More information on SavvyCal security and storage practices is available&nbsp;<a href="/security">here</a>.</p>
<p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from SavvyCal is at your own risk. You should only access SavvyCal within a secure environment.</p>
<h2 id="policy-regarding-children" tabindex="-1">Policy Regarding Children</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using SavvyCal, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of SavvyCal. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at support@savvycal.com.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-track-features" tabindex="-1">Do Not Track Features</h2>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<h2 id="dispute-resolution" tabindex="-1">Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>Details regarding SavvyCal’s dispute resolution process are available in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-this-notice" tabindex="-1">Changes to this Notice</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by a revised “Last updated” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information. If you continue to use SavvyCal after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised Notice.</p>
