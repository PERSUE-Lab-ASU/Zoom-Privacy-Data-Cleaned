Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible. We also employ security measures such as firewalls to protect against intruders, automated monitoring and reporting services and agents to detect suspicious activities, redundancies throughout our network (so that if one server goes down, another can cover for it), encryption where at all possible or appropriate or required by law, testing for and protecting against network vulnerabilities, and regular Malware Scanning.</p><p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.

To the extent that First Light processes Client Data, First Light does so as a data manager on behalf of Clients.</p><p>First Light processes Client Data on behalf of Clients in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement. Each Client, in its capacity as a data governor, may process Client Data in other ways. Cases should check the Client\u2019s own privacy statement to learn how the Client intends to process Case-specific data that may be included in Client Data.
