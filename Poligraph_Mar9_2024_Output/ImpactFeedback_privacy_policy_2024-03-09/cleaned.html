Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible. We also employ security measures such as firewalls to protect against intruders, automated monitoring and reporting services and agents to detect suspicious activities, redundancies throughout our network (so that if one server goes down, another can cover for it), encryption where at all possible or appropriate or required by law, testing for and protecting against network vulnerabilities, and regular Malware Scanning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order, enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, with the above in mind, no security system is 100% secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your information or assume liability for improper access to it. It is the user’s responsibility to keep their password for accessing our sites and Services confidential, change the password frequently and use a strong password. We also recommend that you use the Two-Factor Authentication methods where available to better help protect your accounts from unauthorized access. We strongly recommend that you do not share your password with anyone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">USE OF COOKIES OR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive, smartphone or other device through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

The act's scope is quite broad and goes well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating the exact information collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In accordance with CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><ul id="l2"><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Users can visit our site anonymously.</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">This privacy policy will be easily linked to from our home page or on the on the first substantial page after entering our website.</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">Our Privacy Policy link will include the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">On our Privacy Policy Page</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">Via email if this privacy policy changes in a way that warrants such an action</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can update your personal information:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">By logging in to your account and making updates accordingly</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OUR POLICY REGARDING ‘DO NOT TRACK’ SIGNALS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: left;">We honor 'Do Not Track' signals and Do Not Track, store cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
