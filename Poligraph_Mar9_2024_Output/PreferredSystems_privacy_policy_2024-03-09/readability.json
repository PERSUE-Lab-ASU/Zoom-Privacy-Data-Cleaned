COPYRIGHT POLICY</span></p>\n      <div><p><strong>GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT</strong></p><p> Copyright is the ownership and control of the intellectual property in original works of authorship, which are subject to copyright law. It is the policy of the Preferred Systems, Inc. that all rights in copyright shall remain with the creator unless the work is a work-for-hire (and copyright vests in Preferred Systems, Inc. under copyright law), is supported by a direct allocation of funds through Preferred Systems, Inc. for the pursuit of a specific project, is commissioned by Preferred Systems, Inc., makes significant use of Preferred Systems, Inc. resources or personnel, or is otherwise subject to contractual obligations.</p></div>\n      <div><p><strong>BOOKS, ARTICLES, AND SIMILAR WORKS, INCLUDING UNPATENTABLE SOFTWARE</strong></p><p> In accord with academic tradition, except to the extent set forth in this policy, Preferred Systems, Inc. does not claim ownership to pedagogical, scholarly, or artistic works, regardless of their form of expression.</p></div>\n      <div><p><strong>INSTITUTIONAL WORKS</strong></p><p>Preferred Systems, Inc. shall retain ownership of works created as institutional works. Institutional works include works that are supported by a specific allocation of Preferred Systems, Inc. funds or that are created at the direction of the Preferred Systems, Inc. for a specific purpose. Institutional works also include works whose authorship cannot be attributed to one or a discrete number of authors but rather result from simultaneous or sequential contributions over time by multiple faculty and students. For example, software tools developed and improved over time by multiple faculty and students where authorship is not appropriately attributed to a single or defined group of authors would constitute an institutional work. The mere fact that multiple individuals have contributed to the creation of a work shall not cause the work to constitute an institutional work.</p></div>\n      <div><p><strong>PATENT AND COPYRIGHT AGREEMENT</strong></p><p>All faculty, staff, student employees, as well as non-employees who participate or intend to participate in teaching and/or research at Preferred Systems, Inc. are bound by this policy.

As it is Preferred Systems, Inc.\u2019s policy that Preferred Systems, Inc. shall retain ownership of such works (created as institutional rather than personal efforts, as described in Section 1.C, above), Preferred Systems, Inc. will generally require a written agreement from non-employees that ownership of such works will be assigned to Preferred Systems, Inc.</p><p>\n            Examples of works, which Preferred Systems, Inc. may retain non-employees to prepare, are:</p></div>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Reports by consultants or subcontractors</li>\n            <li>Computer software</li>\n            <li>Illustrations or designs</li>\n            <li>Artistic works</li>\n            <li>Educational programs</li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      <div>\n          <p><strong>VIDEOTAPING AND RELATED CLASSROOM TECHNOLOGY<br></strong><br>Courses taught and courseware developed for teaching at Preferred Systems, Inc., belong to Preferred Systems, Inc.

Copyrightable works that are subject to sponsored research agreements or other contractual obligations of Preferred Systems, Inc. shall be owned by Preferred Systems, Inc., so that Preferred Systems, Inc. may satisfy its contractual obligations.</p></div>\n      <div><p><strong>USE OF PREFERRED SYSTEMS, INC.\u2019S RESOURCES</strong></p><p>Preferred Systems, Inc. resources are to be used solely Preferred Systems, Inc. purposes and not for personal gain or personal commercial advantage, nor for any other non- Preferred Systems, Inc. purposes. Therefore, if the creator of a copyrightable work makes significant use of the services of Preferred Systems, Inc. non-faculty employees or Preferred Systems, Inc. resources to create the work, he or she shall disclose the work to the Director of Education and assign title to Preferred Systems, Inc. Examples of non-significant use include ordinary use of desktop computers, and limited secretarial or administrative resources.

Such a request can, at the discretion of the Director of Education, be granted if it does not: (i) violate any legal obligations of or to Preferred Systems, Inc., (ii) limit appropriate Preferred Systems, Inc. uses of the materials, (iii) create a real or potential conflict of interest for the creator, or (iv) otherwise conflict with Preferred Systems, Inc. goals or principles.</p></div>\n      <p><span>2.

Where royalty distribution to individuals would be impracticable or inequitable (for example, when the copyright-able material has been developed as a educational project), the \"inventor's share\" may be allocated to an educational account in the department where the copyrightable material was developed. Such determination will be made on a case-by-case basis by the Director of Education after consultation with the principal investigator and is subject to the approval of the President of Preferred Systems, Inc.</li>\n            <li>ASSIGNMENTS<br>No assignment, license or other agreement may be entered into or will be considered valid with respect to copyrighted works owned by Preferred Systems, Inc. except by an official specifically authorized to do so.</li>\n            <li>Artistic works</li>\n            <li>Educational programs</li>\n          </ol>\n        </div>\n      <div><p><strong>USE OF PREFERRED SYSTEMS, INC.\u2019S NAME IN COPYRIGHT NOTICES <br></strong><br>The following notice should be placed on Preferred Systems, Inc. owned materials in order to protect the copyright:</p><p>\n             Copyright \u00a9 [year] The Board of Directors, Preferred Systems, Inc.

EXPLANATION OF TERMS<br></span></p>\n      <div>\n          <p><strong>COPYRIGHT</strong></p>\n          <p><span><span></span></span>COPYRIGHTABLE WORKS<br>Under the federal copyright law, copyright subsists in \"original works of authorship\" which have been fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. These works include:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Literary works such as books, journal articles, poems, manuals, memorandum, tests, computer programs, instructional material, databases, bibliographies;</li>\n            <li>Musical works including any accompanying words;</li>\n            <li>Dramatic works, including any accompanying music;</li>\n            <li>Pantomimes and choreographic works (if fixed, as in notation or videotape);</li>\n            <li>Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, including photographs, diagrams, sketches and integrated circuit masks;</li>\n            <li>Motion pictures and other audiovisual works such as videotapes;</li>\n            <li>Sound recordings.</li>\n          </ul>\n          <div><p><span><span></span></span>SCOPE OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION <br>Copyright protection does not extend to any idea, process, concept, discovery or the like, but only to the work in which it may be embodied, illustrated, or explained. For example, a written description of a manufacturing process is copyright-able, but the copyright only prevents unauthorized copying of the description; the process described could be freely copied unless it enjoys some other protection, such as patent.</p><p>\n            Subject to various exceptions and limitations provided for in the copyright law, the copyright owner has the exclusive right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies by sale or otherwise, and display or perform the work publicly. Ownership of copyright is distinct from the ownership of any material object in which the work may be embodied. For example, if one purchases videotape, one does not necessarily obtain the right to make a public showing for profit.</p><p>\n             The term of copyright in works created on or after January 1, 1978, is the life of the author plus seventy years. Copyright in works-for-hire is for ninety-five years from the date of first publication or one hundred twenty years from creation, whichever period first expires.</p></div>\n        </div>\n      <div>\n          <p><strong>WORKS FOR HIRE<br></strong></p>\n          <div><p><span><span></span></span>\"Work for hire\" is a legal term defined in the Copyright Act as \"a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment.\" This definition includes works prepared by employees in satisfaction of sponsored agreements between Preferred Systems, Inc. and outside agencies. Certain commissioned works also are works for hire if the parties so agree in writing.</p><p>\n             The employer (i.e., Preferred Systems, Inc.) by law is the \"author,\" and hence the owner, of works for hire for copyright purposes. Works for hire subject to this principle include works that are developed, in whole or in part, by Preferred Systems, Inc. employees.</p></div>\n        </div>\n      <p><span><span>Preferred Systems, Inc.

It is the policy of the Preferred Systems, Inc. that all rights in copyright shall remain with the creator unless the work is a work-for-hire (and copyright vests in Preferred Systems, Inc. under copyright law), is supported by a direct allocation of funds through Preferred Systems, Inc. for the pursuit of a specific project, is commissioned by Preferred Systems, Inc., makes significant use of Preferred Systems, Inc. resources or personnel, or is otherwise subject to contractual obligations.\n      BOOKS, ARTICLES, AND SIMILAR WORKS, INCLUDING UNPATENTABLE SOFTWARE In accord with academic tradition, except to the extent set forth in this policy, Preferred Systems, Inc. does not claim ownership to pedagogical, scholarly, or artistic works, regardless of their form of expression.\n      INSTITUTIONAL WORKSPreferred Systems, Inc. shall retain ownership of works created as institutional works.

Institutional works also include works whose authorship cannot be attributed to one or a discrete number of authors but rather result from simultaneous or sequential contributions over time by multiple faculty and students. For example, software tools developed and improved over time by multiple faculty and students where authorship is not appropriately attributed to a single or defined group of authors would constitute an institutional work. The mere fact that multiple individuals have contributed to the creation of a work shall not cause the work to constitute an institutional work.\n      PATENT AND COPYRIGHT AGREEMENTAll faculty, staff, student employees, as well as non-employees who participate or intend to participate in teaching and/or research at Preferred Systems, Inc. are bound by this policy. They are also required to sign the Preferred Systems, Inc.\u00a0Patent and Copyright Agreement.\u00a0Except as described in Section 1.B. above, this agreement assigns rights to copyright-able works resulting from Preferred Systems, Inc. projects.\u00a0 This policy applies, and those subject to this policy are deemed to assign their rights to copyright-able works, whether or not a Patent and Copyright Agreements is signed and is on file.\n            Royalty income received by Preferred Systems, Inc. for such works will normally be distributed in accordance with Preferred Systems, Inc.\u00a0 policy (see Section 2.B.2 below).\n      \n          WORKS OF NON-EMPLOYEESUnder the Copyright Act, works of non-employees such as consultants, independent contractors, etc. generally are owned by the creator and not by Preferred Systems, Inc., unless there is a written agreement to the contrary.

Examples of non-significant use include ordinary use of desktop computers, and limited secretarial or administrative resources. Questions about what constitutes significant use should be directed to the Director of Education.\n      \n      \n       \n      \n      \n      RECONVEYANCE OF COPYRIGHT TO CREATORWhen copyright is assigned to Preferred Systems, Inc. because of the provisions of this policy, the creator of the copyrighted material may make a request to the Director of Education that ownership be re-conveyed back to the \u00a0 \u00a0 creator.

EXPLANATION OF TERMS\n      \n          COPYRIGHT\n          COPYRIGHTABLE WORKSUnder the federal copyright law, copyright subsists in \"original works of authorship\" which have been fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. These works include:\n          \n            Literary works such as books, journal articles, poems, manuals, memorandum, tests, computer programs, instructional material, databases, bibliographies;\n            Musical works including any accompanying words;\n            Dramatic works, including any accompanying music;\n            Pantomimes and choreographic works (if fixed, as in notation or videotape);\n            Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, including photographs, diagrams, sketches and integrated circuit masks;\n            Motion pictures and other audiovisual works such as videotapes;\n            Sound recordings.\n          \n          SCOPE OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION Copyright protection does not extend to any idea, process, concept, discovery or the like, but only to the work in which it may be embodied, illustrated, or explained. For example, a written description of a manufacturing process is copyright-able, but the copyright only prevents unauthorized copying of the description; the process described could be freely copied unless it enjoys some other protection, such as patent.\n            Subject to various exceptions and limitations provided for in the copyright law, the copyright owner has the exclusive right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies by sale or otherwise, and display or perform the work publicly. Ownership of copyright is distinct from the ownership of any material object in which the work may be embodied. For example, if one purchases videotape, one does not necessarily obtain the right to make a public showing for profit.\n             The term of copyright in works created on or after January 1, 1978, is the life of the author plus seventy years. Copyright in works-for-hire is for ninety-five years from the date of first publication or one hundred twenty years from creation, whichever period first expires.\n        \n      \n          WORKS FOR HIRE\n          \"Work for hire\" is a legal term defined in the Copyright Act as \"a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment.\" This definition includes works prepared by employees in satisfaction of sponsored agreements between Preferred Systems, Inc. and outside agencies. Certain commissioned works also are works for hire if the parties so agree in writing.\n             The employer (i.e., Preferred Systems, Inc.) by law is the \"author,\" and hence the owner, of works for hire for copyright purposes. Works for hire subject to this principle include works that are developed, in whole or in part, by Preferred Systems, Inc. employees.\n        \n      Preferred Systems, Inc.
