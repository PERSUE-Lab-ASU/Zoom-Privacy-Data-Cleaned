        </span><br>
        <br> Presenters must have knowledge and expertise in the content area and take an active part in planning their presentations.<br>
        <br>Presenters have documented qualifications that demonstrate their education and experience in the content area they are presenting. Expertise in subject matter is evaluated based on education, professional achievements and credentials, work<br> experience, honors, awards, professional publications, etc. Presenters participate in planning, and there is documentation of involvement in the planning of their own presentations.<br>
        <br> An active role in planning an activity can range from the development of objectives, content outline, or teaching methods to providing input in these areas. The activity and teaching/learning materials are prepared by the presenter or prepared by the planners with input from the presenters.<br><br>
        <span class="policies_headline">Disclosure and Resolution of Personal Conflicts of Interest Policy </span><br>
        <br>Having planners and presenters with relevant financial relationships or affiliations with a commercial company does not preclude involvement in a continuing education activity; however, the relationships, or lack of, must be made known to the learners in advance and in accordance with Preferred Systems, Inc. and its Continuing Education guidelines.<br>
        <br> A relevant financial relationship is a relationship in which the individual benefits by receiving a salary, royalty, intellectual property rights, consulting fee, honoraria, ownership interest, or other financial benefit.&nbsp; Financial relationships can also include “contracted research” where the institution gets the grant and manages the funds and the individual is the principal or named investigator on the grant. Preferred Systems, Inc. considers relationships of the person involved in the activity to include financial relationships of a family member.&nbsp; Preferred Systems, Inc.&nbsp; also considers financial relationships in any amount occurring within the past 12 months as relevant in terms of creating a conflict of interest. All financial relationships, or lack of, must be disclosed to the learners for twelve months following initiation of the relationship.<br><br> If a conflict arises as a result of the financial relationship, disclosure statements must be obtained from ALL planners and presenters to identify and resolve any potentially biasing relevant financial relationships on the part of those who have an impact on the content of the education activity. Planners or presenters who do not provide disclosure statements may not participate in the activity.<br>
        <br> When a relevant financial relationship is identified, the provider must inform participants of the following:</div>
      <ul>
        <li class="policies_list_item">name of the individual</li>
        <li class="policies_list_item">nature of commercial interest(s)</li>
        <li class="policies_list_item">nature of the relationship the individual has with each commercial interest</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="subpage_text policies_subpage_text"><span class="policies_headline"><span></span></span>Disclosure of information about provider and faculty relationships must be disclosed to participants either verbally or in writing <span class="text-span">prior</span> to the program. The source of all support from entities with commercial interests must be disclosed to learners <span class="text-span-2">prior</span> to the beginning of the educational activity. When commercial support is other than monetary support, the nature of the support must also be disclosed to learners.</div>
      <div class="subpage_text policies_subpage_text"><span class="policies_headline"><strong>Target Audience and Needs Assessment</strong></span><br>
        <br> The activity is developed in response to educational needs of potential participants. Activities are planned and implemented based on identified needs of the target audience. Educational needs include general professional issues, specific practice problems, or issues related to future trends in practice.<br>
        <br>Data gathering for a needs assessment may include asking attendees what their needs are, analyzing the specific identified attendee population and specific professional requirements, and reviewing professional literature. Characteristics of potential learners are also considered in planning the activity.<br>
        <br>The method/process used to identify target audience and determine needs is documented.<br><br><span class="policies_headline">Education Design Documentation<br><br></span><span><span><span class="policy_sub_header"><span>Objectives</span></span>
        </span>
        </span><br>
        <br>Educational objectives are written, measurable statements; objectives describe the knowledge, skills and/or attitude changes that should occur upon successful completion of the activity. Determination of the objectives is a collaborative activity between planners and presenters. The objectives are derived from the overall purpose/goal of the activity.<br><br> Learner-oriented outcomes are expressed in measurable terms, identified observable actions. Each objective has corresponding content. <br>
        <br><span class="policy_sub_header">Content</span><br>
        <br> Content is related to and is consistent with the activity objectives and each objective has corresponding content.<br>
        <br>Each objective has written content that is directly related to that objective. Subject matter relates to each objective.&nbsp;<br> This outline provides information on the material that will be presented to support the intended outcome and facilitate learner achievement of the objectives. <br>
        <span class="policy_sub_header"><br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Course Update</span><br><br> All courses provided by Preferred Systems, Inc. are updated in accordance to the established policies by the appropriate certification/accreditation authority.&nbsp; Technical courses are updated on a yearly basis.<br>

          <div class="subpage_text policies_subpage_text"><span class="policies_headline"><span></span></span>COPYRIGHTABLE WORKS<br>Under the federal copyright law, copyright subsists in "original works of authorship" which have been fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. These works include:</div>
          <ul>
            <li class="policies_list_item">Literary works such as books, journal articles, poems, manuals, memorandum, tests, computer programs, instructional material, databases, bibliographies;</li>
            <li class="policies_list_item">Musical works including any accompanying words;</li>
            <li class="policies_list_item">Dramatic works, including any accompanying music;</li>
            <li class="policies_list_item">Pantomimes and choreographic works (if fixed, as in notation or videotape);</li>
            <li class="policies_list_item">Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, including photographs, diagrams, sketches and integrated circuit masks;</li>
            <li class="policies_list_item">Motion pictures and other audiovisual works such as videotapes;</li>
            <li class="policies_list_item">Sound recordings.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="subpage_text policies_subpage_text"><span class="policies_headline"><span></span></span>SCOPE OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION <br>Copyright protection does not extend to any idea, process, concept, discovery or the like, but only to the work in which it may be embodied, illustrated, or explained. For example, a written description of a manufacturing process is copyright-able, but the copyright only prevents unauthorized copying of the description; the process described could be freely copied unless it enjoys some other protection, such as patent.<br>
            <br>Subject to various exceptions and limitations provided for in the copyright law, the copyright owner has the exclusive right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies by sale or otherwise, and display or perform the work publicly. Ownership of copyright is distinct from the ownership of any material object in which the work may be embodied. For example, if one purchases videotape, one does not necessarily obtain the right to make a public showing for profit.<br>
            <br> The term of copyright in works created on or after January 1, 1978, is the life of the author plus seventy years. Copyright in works-for-hire is for ninety-five years from the date of first publication or one hundred twenty years from creation, whichever period first expires.</div>

          <div class="subpage_text policies_subpage_text"><span class="policies_headline"><span></span></span>"Work for hire" is a legal term defined in the Copyright Act as "a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment." This definition includes works prepared by employees in satisfaction of sponsored agreements between Preferred Systems, Inc. and outside agencies. Certain commissioned works also are works for hire if the parties so agree in writing.<br>
            <br> The employer (i.e., Preferred Systems, Inc.) by law is the "author," and hence the owner, of works for hire for copyright purposes. Works for hire subject to this principle include works that are developed, in whole or in part, by Preferred Systems, Inc. employees.</div>
