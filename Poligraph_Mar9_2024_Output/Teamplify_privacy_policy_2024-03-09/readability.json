We also process this information\n          on other bases.\n        \n        \n          If you have a paid account with us, there will be other data\n          elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing\n          that contract. Teamplify does not collect or process a credit card\n          number, but our third-party payment processor does.\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Consent:\n      \n        \n          As a user, you can fill out the information in your user profile,\n          and you have the option to provide User Personal Information such\n          as your date of birth, your country, and your timezone. We\n          process this information on the basis of consent. All of this\n          information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to\n          access, modify, and delete it at any time.\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Legitimate Interests:\n      \n        \n          Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information\n          we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate\n          interests. For example, for legal compliance purposes or to\n          maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and\n          resilience of Teamplify's systems, website, and service, we must\n          keep logs of Technical Information.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of\n    consent or object to our processing of personal information, please\n    contact Teamplify Support at\n    support@teamplify.com.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Children under 16\n  \n\n  \n    If you're a child under the age of 16, you may not have an account on\n    Teamplify. Teamplify does not knowingly collect information from or direct\n    any of our content specifically to children under 16. If we learn or have\n    reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 16, we will\n    unfortunately have to close your account. We don't want to discourage you\n    from using our product, but those are the rules. Please see our\n    Terms of Service for information about\n    account termination. Other countries may have different minimum age limits,\n    and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data\n    collection in your country, you may not use Teamplify without obtaining\n    your parents' or legal guardians' consent.\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n    We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with\n    third parties for their commercial purposes, except where you have\n    specifically told us to.\n  \n  \n    We do not host advertising on Teamplify. We may occasionally embed content\n    from third party sites, such as YouTube or Vimeo, and that content may\n    include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded\n    content contains, we can't always control what third parties show. Any\n    advertisements on our site are not sponsored by, or tracked by, Teamplify.\n  \n  \n    We do not disclose User Personal Information outside Teamplify,\n    except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on\n    Compelled Disclosure.\n  \n  \n    We do share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party\n    vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and\n    who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Policy\n    by signing data protection agreements. Our vendors perform services such\n    as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data\n    transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our\n    vendors, we remain responsible for it. While Teamplify processes all User\n    Personal Information in the European Union, our third party vendors may\n    process data outside of the European Union. If you would like to know who\n    our third party vendors are, please see\n    Subprocessors below.\n  \n  \n    We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger,\n    sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will\n    ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User\n    Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email\n    before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization\n    receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we\n    have made in our Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    How you can access and control the information we collect\n  \n\n  \n    If you're already a Teamplify user, you may access, update, alter, or delete\n    your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or\n    contacting Teamplify Support at\n    support@teamplify.com. You can\n    control the information we collect about you by limiting what information\n    is in your profile, by updating out of date information, or by contacting\n    Teamplify Support.\n  \n  \n    If Teamplify processes information about you and you do not have an account,\n    such as information Teamplify receives from third party integrations, then\n    you may access, update, alter, delete, or object to the processing of your\n    personal information by contacting Teamplify Support.\n  \n  \n    As a Teamplify User, you can always take your data with you. You can contact\n    Teamplify Support and request all of the data we have about you.\n  \n  \n    Generally, Teamplify will retain User Personal Information for as long as\n    your account is active or as needed to provide you services.\n  \n  \n    We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you\n    delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don't automatically\n    delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account,\n    we will retain your account information indefinitely.\n  \n  \n    If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal\n    Information, you may do so by contacting Teamplify Support. We will retain\n    and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,\n    resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal\n    requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 30\n    days.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Our use of cookies\n  \n\n  \n    Teamplify uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and\n    meaningful. A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on\n    your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you\n    return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are\n    merely visiting Teamplify; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier\n    for each logged in user. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like\n    HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and\n    provide information for future development of Teamplify. For security\n    reasons, we use cookies to identify a device. By using our website, you\n    agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device.\n    If you disable your browser or device's ability to accept these cookies,\n    you will not be able to log in or use Teamplify's services.\n  \n  \n    Teamplify sets the following cookies on our users for the following reasons:\n  \n  \n    \n      sessionid \u2013 this cookie is used to log you in and also helps\n      to prevent CSRF attacks;\n    \n    \n      AWSALB, AWSALBCORS \u2013 these two cookies are used by AWS\n      Application Load Balancers to enable \"sticky sessions\" mode.

All of them have signed data\n    protection agreements with us that limit the type of personal information\n    they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    How we respond to compelled disclosure\n  \n\n  \n    Teamplify may disclose personally-identifying information or other\n    information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid\n    subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we\n    believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our\n    property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.\n  \n  \n    In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Teamplify\n    strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort\n    to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are\n    prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent\n    circumstances.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    How we communicate with you\n  \n\n  \n    We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said\n    that's okay, and only for the reasons you've said that's okay. For example,\n    if you contact our Support team with a request, we may respond to you\n    via email.\n  \n  \n    Depending on the notification settings in your workspace, Teamplify may\n    occasionally send notification emails. We may also send marketing emails,\n    based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and\n    regulations. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of\n    the notification or marketing emails we send you. Please note that you can\n    not opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails\n    from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your\n    notifications settings in your profile.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Subprocessors\n  \n\n  \n    When we share your information with third party subprocessors, such as our\n    vendors and service providers, we remain responsible for it. We work very\n    hard to maintain your trust when we bring on new vendors, and we require\n    all vendors to enter into data protection agreements with us that restrict\n    their processing of Users' Personal Information (as defined in this policy).\n  \n  \n    All of our subprocessors located in the United States comply with the\n    \n      EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks\n    .\n  \n  \n    The full list of our subprocessorts, their location and description of\n    processing:\n  \n  \n    \n      Amazon Web Services (AWS),\n      Europe, Stockholm \u2013 data hosting;\n    \n    \n      Crisp,\n      Europe \u2013 customer support;\n    \n    \n      New Relic,\n      Europe \u2013 website performance and application logs;\n    \n    \n      Sentry,\n      United States \u2013 error reporting;\n    \n    \n      Stripe,\n      United States \u2013 subscription credit card payment processor.\n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    Resolving complaints\n  \n\n  \n    If you have concerns about the way Teamplify is handling your User Personal\n    Information, please let us know immediately.

If we cannot, we have selected to cooperate with the\n    relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the\n    European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU\n    individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information\n    Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.
