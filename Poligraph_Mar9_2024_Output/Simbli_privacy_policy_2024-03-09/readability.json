However, several features of the Web site require entry of personally identifiable information. This information is requested so that we can act and respond to you. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you will not be able to take advantage of these features.&nbsp;<p>\n\nFor example when you request a demonstration of our Application we require you to provide your personal contact information, such as your name, company, phone number, and email address. In addition, if you send us a message or use an online form, application, or service offered through EBS\u2019s Web site, we may receive and may need to retain that personally identifiable information in order to act or respond to you. The information will be treated confidentially within our company, as we protect other confidential information.</p><p>\n\n<strong>In our Application:</strong><br>\nEBS provides our Application to subscribing customers (\"Subscribers\") to facilitate management of their organizations. The Application is not part of our corporate Web site. The Application enables our Subscribers to request information from you when you access certain content within the Application. You may also be required to supply personally identifiable information to establish a user account within the Subscriber''''s Application.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\nEBS serves as a Data Processor for the Subscribers and as such EBS does not own the information that is submitted to our Application, except as described below. Use of the Application is subject to the Terms of Service which include Permitted and Prohibited Use.

We request that personally identifiable information in order to act or respond to you. The information will be treated confidentially within our company, as we protect other confidential information.</p><p>\n\nHow long we retain your Personal Data depends on the type of data and the purpose for which we process the data.
