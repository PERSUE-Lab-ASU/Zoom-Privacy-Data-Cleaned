                                        <h5><strong>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></h5>
                                        <p>We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>
                                        <h5><strong>What is GDPR?</strong></h5>
                                        <p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
                                        <p>The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>
                                        <h5><strong>What is personal data?</strong></h5>
                                        <p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
                                        <h5><strong>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</strong></h5>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
                                            <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
                                            <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
                                            <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h5><strong>Why is GDPR important?</strong></h5>
                                        <p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Aaandboom we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>
                                        <h5><strong>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</strong></h5>
                                        <p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Aaandboom processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 1 year.</p>
                                        <p>Aaandboom services can be used without any registration or identification, and we don’t store any PII – therefore it is not possible to allow clients to access, download or delete the PII data. The reason is simple – we don’t store anything except the technical data which is deleted automatically.</p>
                                        <h5><strong>California Residents</strong></h5>
                                        <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose categories of Personal Information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from whom we collect Personal Information, and the third parties with whom we share it, which we have explained above.</p>
                                        <p>We are also required to communicate information about rights California residents have under California law. You may exercise the following rights:</p>

                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.</p>
                                        <h5>Limitation of Liability</h5>
                                        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of Aaandboom and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the app.</p>
                                        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Aaandboom or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the app, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the app, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if Aaandboom or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
                                        <p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
                                        <h5>Severability</h5>
                                        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
                                        <p>This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by Aaandboom on the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Aaandboom concerning the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Aaandboom’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND Aaandboom AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>

                                        <p>No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power under this Agreement preclude further exercise of that or any other right granted herein. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.</p>
                                        <h5>Amendments to this Agreement</h5>
