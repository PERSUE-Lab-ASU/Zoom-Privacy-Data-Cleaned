<p> <strong style="background-color: initial;">Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p> <strong></strong></p>
<p> This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Fuhr Software, Inc. (“Fuhr”) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User" or “you”) of the portal.lobbycentral.com (portal.lobbycentral.com) website and all products and services offered by Fuhr Software, Inc. and/or offered under the LobbyCentral® trademarks (the "Services") including both end users of the Services and licensees of the Services. This privacy policy applies to all products and services offered by Fuhr Software, Inc. and all products and services offered under the LobbyCentral trademark (collectively referred to as “LobbyCentral”) including mobile applications, website services, and software.</p>
<p> Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand LobbyCentral’s policies and practices regarding user information. If you do not agree with LobbyCentral policies and practices, do not use the Services. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Policy. This Policy may change from time to time, without notice. Your continued use of this Services after LobbyCentral makes changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, and you agree to check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.</p>
<p> <strong>Children Under the Age of 13</strong></p>
<p> The Services are not intended for children under thirteen (13) years of age. No one under age thirteen (13) may provide any information to the Services. Neither Fuhr or LobbyCentral knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen (13). If you are under thirteen (13), do not use or access the Services in any fashion. If you believe Fuhr or LobbyCentral may have any information from or about a child under thirteen (13), please contact us at support@lobbycentral.com.</p>
<p> <strong>Information Collected and How it is Used.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> Some Users of LobbyCentral use the Services in association with visiting, interacting, or “checking-in” with a licensee of the Services (the “Licensee”). LobbyCentral collects several types of information directly from Users of the Services, including, as appropriate, first and last name, the identity of the Licensee you are visiting when using the Services, reason for visiting the Licensee of the Services, time and date of your visit to the Licensee when using the Services, credit card numbers, and email address. This Privacy Policy also applies to as any other information you choose to provide to LobbyCentral. Licensees may request additional information from Users in Licensee’s sole discretion. LobbyCentral makes no guarantee about the contents or subjects of such Licensee-requested information; however, the terms of this Privacy Policy will apply to such requested information. However, LobbyCentral makes no warranties or guarantees about what such Licensee may do with your information. LobbyCentral only collects personal identification information from Users if such information to us is voluntarily submitted to us. Users may refuse to supply personally identifiable information; however, it may prevent you from properly using the Services or engaging in certain Services-related activities.</p>
<p> The Services may allow you to only provide a first name and last initial to use the check-in services. However, the Licensee must have enabled this option in its use of the Services. If you would like to only submit your first name and last initial, please inform the Licensee.&nbsp;</p>
<p> LobbyCentral also indirectly collects several types of information that does not generally identify you including information about the internet connection, browser, and equipment you use to access the Services and usage details. This information is collected from you when you directly provide information to LobbyCentral and automatically as you navigate through the Services. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.</p>
<p> <strong>Technology Used</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> If you use your own device to access the Services, LobbyCentral may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Services. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, the Services will issue cookies when you direct your browser to the Services. Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, note that some parts of the Services may not function properly.</p>
<p> Additionally, certain features of the Services may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on the Services. The Services may also use small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit LobbyCentral, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). LobbyCentral does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals from web browsers.</p>
<p> <strong>How We Use Collected Information </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> For all Users of the Services, we may collect and use Users personal information to (a) provide the Services, (b) provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us, (c) to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection, (d) to notify you about changes to our Services or any products or services we offer or provide though it, (e) improve customer service,(f) to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it, and (g) in any other way we may describe when you provide the information. Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests and support needs more efficiently.</p>
<p> For Licensees of the Services, we may collect and use information Users provide about themselves when placing an order only to provide service to that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service. We may also use the email address to send User information and updates pertaining to their order. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. If a User decides to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email or User may contact us via support@lobbycentral.com.</p>
<p> <strong>How we protect your information </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Services. Sensitive and private data exchange between the Services and its Users happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information in our possession and control, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of personal data or non-personal data due to no fault of ours including, but limited to, errors in transmission and unauthorized acts of our staff.</p>
<p> <strong>Sharing your personal information </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> We do not sell, trade, or rent Users’ personally identifiable information to others. &nbsp;However, we may disclose personal information that we collect, or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy (a) to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it, including sharing with any third-party services that assist us in providing the Services you receive from us, (b) for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information, (c) otherwise with your consent. We may also disclose your personal information (d) to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government, regulatory request, or applicable public records request; (e) to enforce or apply our terms of use, if any, and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes; and (f) if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of our customers, or others.</p>
<p> We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personally identifiable information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.</p>
<p> <strong>Mergers/Acquisition</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> For the purpose of developing and expanding our business, we may share, rent, sell or buy business assets. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets.&nbsp; Also, in the event Fuhr Software, Inc. or LobbyCentral or its assets are acquired in a merger or other similar transaction, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Accessing Your Personal Data</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> You may send us an email at support@lobbycentral.com to request access to or correct any personal information that you have provided to us. You may request to have us delete your personal data; however, we do not guarantee that we can comply with all requests and we may retain certain data that is necessary for the products or services or that is required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements, including compliance with all applicable public records requests laws. We may keep raw data from your use of the Services and information you submit to the Services, but will work to remove all personally identifiable information from such content.</p>
<p> You may unsubscribe from our newsletter or from receiving update emails at any time via the link provided on the newsletter or email. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.</p>
<p> <strong>Data Security</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.</p>
<p> <strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will notify you. The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is below. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Services and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes. If we are acquired or merged with another company, your information may be transferred to the new owners in order to continue to contact you.</p>
