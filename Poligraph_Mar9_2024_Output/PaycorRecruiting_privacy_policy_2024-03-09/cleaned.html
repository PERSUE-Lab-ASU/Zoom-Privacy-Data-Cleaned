<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-transform:uppercase">Paycor Gravity</h2>



<p>EFFECTIVE DATE: July 18, 2023</p>



<p>The Gravity application is used by individuals and Employers (as applicable, “you”) to share jobs on socials networks, manage employee referral programs, and incentivizes people to share jobs and generate applicants.</p>



<p>In addition to the provisions outlined in the Paycor Privacy Policy, the following information below applies to the use of Paycor Gravity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Collection of Personal Information</h3>



<p>Personal Information collected may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Job openings that you share via the Gravity application</li>



<li>Any further personal data contained in any files that you share via the Gravity application</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>



<p>When you sign in through the Gravity application, Paycor will assign you a unique identifier and send such information to your computer or device hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours and allow you to use the Gravity application’s functionality with minimal subsequent registration procedures. Cookies are also used to record you as the source of any candidate or job referrals on the Gravity application. If you apply for a job opening that has been shared through the Gravity application, Paycor will assign you a unique identifier and send such information to your computer or device hard drive in the form of a cookie. This code is unique to you and will correlate your job application to the person that posted such job opening on the Gravity application. It does not contain any of your Personal Information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Personal Profile Information</strong></h3>



<p>When you register on the Gravity application, Paycor uses a third-party provider, Akamai, to manage the Gravity application login registration process and create a personal profile for you on the Gravity application (“Personal Profile”). Each Personal Profile is assigned a unique personal identification number and requires that you choose a username and password to access your Personal Profile on the Gravity application, which helps Paycor to ensure that only you can access your Personal Profile and Personal Information on the Gravity application. Because you assist Paycor in developing your Personal Profile username and password, you have a significant role in protecting your Personal Profile and Personal Information. No one can access or edit your Personal Profile without knowing your Personal Profile username and password, so do not share these with others.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Personal Choices</strong></h3>



<p>Paycor acknowledges an individual’s right to access their Personal Information. If you want to review or update your Personal Information, you may do so on the Gravity application by visiting your Personal Profile. Note that if you are a candidate (and not a user of the Gravity application) who would like to access your Personal Information, you will need to request this information from your Employer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Social Network Profiles</strong></h3>



<p>When you post a job opening on the Gravity application, Paycor will request your permission to access your social networks including, without limitation, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn so that you can share such job openings with your social network connections. Paycor will not post any job openings or other content on your social networks, or amend any of your posted job openings or content without your authorization. The Gravity application will also not track any of your social network activity, other than when you specifically use the Gravity application to share job openings on your social networks. All use of your Personal Information by any social network service provider is subject to each network’s posted terms of service and privacy policy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vouching Content</strong></h3>



<p>Paycor may ask you to vouch for people that have applied to job openings you have shared on the Gravity application. Your Employer will be responsible for determining who is allowed to view your responses to such vouching requests.</p>



<p>Sharing Of Information – Gravity</p>



<p>In addition to the circumstances articulated previously in this Privacy Policy above, with regard to the Gravity application, Paycor may also disclose your Personal Information with:</p>



<ul>
<li>Your Employer, solely in regards to the existence of your Gravity application account, information on job openings you share using the Gravity application, your Gravity application account point totals, and vouching recommendations (pursuant to the Vouching Content section); and</li>



<li>Any other parties to whom you permit disclosure, including, without limitation, social network websites.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security</strong></h3>



<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to Paycor. With the exception of Personal Profile login information stored by Akamai, as detailed under the Cookies section above, your Personal Information may be stored locally on your device and may be transmitted to servers owned, leased or utilized by Paycor in the United States.</p>

<p>Personal Information collected may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Race, ethnicity, religion, health, and sexual orientation (anonymized) if provided through the use of services</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How we process an individual’s personal data</h3>



<p>Following collection of personal data, our system creates a candidate profile for each individual whose personal data has been collected. The process involves merging the personal data collected from various different sources and, where there are any discrepancies, uploading the most recent available.</p>



<p>Our system also uses certain predictive algorithms to fill in blanks in individual profiles, such as where the personal data collected does not include a particular skill or experience which might normally be included. In situations such as these, our system in conjunction with information collected by our Bots, predicts whether a person is likely to have a certain skill and adds it to their profile.. &nbsp;Before providing the profiles to the customer, the Bots search through the original sources of the personal data collected to determine if any information needs to be updated. Once all relevant data has been updated, the profiles are pseudonymized and provided to the customer. This process may be repeated until the customer selects the individuals they wish to engage or interview; all throughout the customer’s search the profiles remain pseudonymized.</p>



<p>For individuals located within the US, we will provide contact information if we are able to obtain it. For individuals based in the EU and Israel, we will contact them to, notify: that we hold their personal data, how and why we hold and process that personal data, and that they have been selected by a customer for direct contact in connection with a potential job opportunity. For Individuals based in Israel and the EU, we will not provide the customer with the contact and other identifying details until we have obtained their consent.</p>
