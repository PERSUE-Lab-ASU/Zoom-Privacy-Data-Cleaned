Our customers trust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We collect and use personal information only to allow us to provide our products and services to our customers and end users and we do so at the direction of our customers. We do not and will not sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is required in the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger or acquisition.</p>\n<h3><strong>Data Privacy Framework</strong></h3>\n<p>Class adheres to the principles of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Class relies on the EU-U.S. DPF as a legal basis for the transfers of personal information. To learn more, visit our <a href=\"https://assets.class.com/m/7c137f05bd047f7f/original/Class-Technologies-Inc-DPF-Privacy-Supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Privacy Framework Notice here</a>.</p>\n<p>Class will rely on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as a legal basis to transfer personal information from the UK and Switzerland once the applicable local authorities approve the Adequacy Decisions. In the meantime, Class shall continue to rely on the SCC\u2019s for the purposes of the UK and Swiss data protection law.</p>\n<p>In the United States, we comply with applicable state laws, regulations, and other legal binding requirements relating to privacy, data protection, data security, and the processing of Personal Data, including but not limited to and to the extent applicable, the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Ci. Code. \u00a7 1798.100 et seq. and associated regulations and amendments, (\u201cCCPA\u201d).</p>\n<p>We take appropriate safeguards to protect your privacy, your fundamental rights and freedoms, and the ability to exercise your rights. For example, if we transfer personal information from the <strong>EEA, the UK, or Switzerland</strong> to another country such as the United States, we will implement an appropriate data transfer solution such as entering into \u201cstandard contractual clauses\u201d approved by the European Commission or competent governmental authority (as applicable) with you, the data exporter. If your use of Class products or services requires us to process any personally identifiable information (PII\u201d or \u201cPersonal Data\u201d), we shall do so at all times in compliance with the Class Technologies, Inc. <a href=\"https://assets.class.com/m/4880dc0f79b8a0c2/original/Class-Technologies-Inc-Data-Protection-Addendum.pdf\">Data Processing Addendum</a>.</p>\n<h3><b>Class Privacy Assurances</b>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We do not sell your data or student data.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We do not own the content you share with <strong>Class</strong>, you do.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We use the latest security best practices to protect you.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We are compliant with FERPA, COPPA, CCPA, CPRA and GDPR, among other privacy laws.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We are transparent about our practices and will let you know if things change.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We do not advertise in <strong>Class.</strong></li>\n<li>We are <strong>SOC 2 Type II</strong> compliant and shall maintain that standing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Children\u2019s Privacy \u2013 Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong><b><br>\n</b></h3>\n<p><span>We support the guidelines and regulatory requirements provided in COPPA.

Our customers trust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We collect and use personal information only to allow us to provide our products and services to our customers and end users and we do so at the direction of our customers. We do not and will not sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is required in the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger or acquisition.\nData Privacy Framework\nClass adheres to the principles of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Class relies on the EU-U.S. DPF as a legal basis for the transfers of personal information. To learn more, visit our Data Privacy Framework Notice here.\nClass will rely on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as a legal basis to transfer personal information from the UK and Switzerland once the applicable local authorities approve the Adequacy Decisions. In the meantime, Class shall continue to rely on the SCC\u2019s for the purposes of the UK and Swiss data protection law.\nIn the United States, we comply with applicable state laws, regulations, and other legal binding requirements relating to privacy, data protection, data security, and the processing of Personal Data, including but not limited to and to the extent applicable, the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Ci. Code. \u00a7 1798.100 et seq. and associated regulations and amendments, (\u201cCCPA\u201d).\nWe take appropriate safeguards to protect your privacy, your fundamental rights and freedoms, and the ability to exercise your rights. For example, if we transfer personal information from the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland to another country such as the United States, we will implement an appropriate data transfer solution such as entering into \u201cstandard contractual clauses\u201d approved by the European Commission or competent governmental authority (as applicable) with you, the data exporter.
