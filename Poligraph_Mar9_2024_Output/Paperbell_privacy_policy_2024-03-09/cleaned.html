<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International transfers</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission: </span></i><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</span></i></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we use certain service providers based outwith the EEA, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any other case, we will obtain your explicit consent before any transfer takes place.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data security</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology and using trusted third parties. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long we store your personal data for</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We normally delete personal identifiable information we hold on you within 12 months of you unsubscribing, but in some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data sooner: see Deleting personal data below for further information.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where we anonymise your personal data (i.e. so that it can no longer be associated with you) for further research or statistical purposes, then we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your rights</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to your information</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Request correction of your personal data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Request deletion of your personal data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Object to processing of your personal data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Request restriction of processing your personal data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Request transfer of your personal data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right to withdraw consent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right to review by an independent authority</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to your information</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to ask for a copy of the information which we hold on you (commonly known as a ‘data subject access request’).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correcting personal data</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to request that we correct personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deleting personal data</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. This is more commonly known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request to delete or remove personal data for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Objecting to processing</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to stop us processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. We will always inform you if we intend to use your personal data for such purposes, or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at hello@paperbell.com.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also object to us processing your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restriction of processing</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transferring your personal data</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In certain circumstances, you may request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Withdrawing consent</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data you can withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review by an independent authority</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will always have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory body. The relevant authority in the UK is the Information Commissioner’s Office. If you do have a complaint, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please do contact us in the first instance if possible.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes to our privacy policy</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This version was last updated on 18th June 2020.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact us</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions, comments and requests regarding this privacy policy are welcomed and should be addressed to hello@paperbell.com</span></p></div>
