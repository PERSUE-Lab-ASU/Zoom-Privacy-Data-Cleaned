This service allows website tags to be managed via an interface. The Google Tool Manager only implements tags. This means that no cookies are used and no personal data is collected. The Google Tool Manager triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. However, the Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If deactivation has been carried out at domain or cookie level, it remains in place for all tracking tags, provided that these are implemented with the Google Tag Manager.</p>\n                <h3>c) Google reCAPTCHA</h3>\n                <p>We use the Google service reCaptcha to determine whether a human or a computer is making a certain entry in our contact or newsletter form.

This means that IP addresses are further processed in abbreviated form, thus excluding the possibility of direct personal identification. The software is set so that the IP addresses are not stored in full, but 2 bytes of the IP address are masked (e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx). In this way, it is no longer possible to assign the shortened IP address to the calling computer. The IP address transmitted by your browser via Matomo is not merged with other data collected by us.</p>\n                <p><b>Legal basis for the processing of personal data<br></b>The legal basis for the processing of the user's data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or \u00a7 15 para. 3 TMG.</p>\n                <p><b>Purposes of processing<br></b>We use Matomo to analyze the use of our website and individual functions and offers in order to continuously improve the user experience.

This data is processed separately, not assigned to any natural person and then regularly deleted.\n                f) Facebook visitor action pixel\n                Our website uses the visitor action pixel from Facebook, Facebook Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (\"Facebook\") to measure conversions. This allows the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they have been redirected to the provider's website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This allows the effectiveness of Facebook ads to be evaluated for statistical and market research purposes and future advertising measures to be optimized.\n                The data collected is anonymous for us as the operator of this website; we cannot draw any conclusions about the identity of the user. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Facebook Data Usage Policy. This allows Facebook to place advertisements on Facebook pages and outside of Facebook. This use of the data cannot be influenced by us as the site operator.\n                Facebook Pixel is used on the basis of Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in effective advertising measures including social media.

We have no influence on this data transfer.\n                We have also integrated content from the following third-party providers on this website: Google Maps and Google Web Fonts (external fonts).\n                h) Matomo\n                Scope and description of the processing of personal dataOur website uses the web analysis service Matomo, an open source solution.\n                Matomo stores cookies on your end device that enable your use of our website to be analyzed. The information collected in this way is stored exclusively on our server, namely the following data:\n                \n                    two bytes of the IP address of the user's calling system\n                    the website accessed\n                    the website from which the user accessed the website (referrer)\n                    the subpages that are accessed from the accessed website\n                    the time spent on the website\n                    the frequency with which the website is accessed\n                \n                Our website uses Matomo with the setting \"Anonymize Visitors' IP addresses\". This means that IP addresses are further processed in abbreviated form, thus excluding the possibility of direct personal identification. The software is set so that the IP addresses are not stored in full, but 2 bytes of the IP address are masked (e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx). In this way, it is no longer possible to assign the shortened IP address to the calling computer. The IP address transmitted by your browser via Matomo is not merged with other data collected by us.\n                Legal basis for the processing of personal dataThe legal basis for the processing of the user's data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or \u00a7 15 para. 3 TMG.\n                Purposes of processingWe use Matomo to analyze the use of our website and individual functions and offers in order to continuously improve the user experience. By statistically evaluating user behavior, we improve our offer and make it more interesting for visitors.\n                Duration of storageThe data of the processing described here will be deleted after a storage period of 90 days.\n                i) Brevo\n                This website uses Brevo to send newsletters and emails.

We provide a link for this purpose in every newsletter message.\n                Data analysis by Brevo\n                With the help of Brevo, we are able to analyze our newsletter campaigns. For example, we can see whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. In this way, we can determine, among other things, which links were clicked on particularly often.\n                Brevo also allows us to subdivide (\"cluster\") newsletter recipients according to various categories. The newsletter recipients can be subdivided according to the selection of the desired newsletter. In this way, the newsletters can be better adapted to the respective target groups.\n                j) Weglot\n                Functions of the Weglot translation service are integrated on this website.
