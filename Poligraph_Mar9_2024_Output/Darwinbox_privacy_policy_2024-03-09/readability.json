Governmental and regulatory bodies need to follow the stipulated procedure to obtain valid and binding orders that shall be undisputed. The company will review all orders and object to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate ones. If compelled to disclose customer data to a government body, Darwinbox will give customers reasonable notice of the demand to allow the customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless Darwinbox is legally prohibited from doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDarwinbox does not sell personal data that is collected or processed under this Privacy Statement.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInternational Data Transfers\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDarwinbox while headquartered in Hyderabad, India and with registered offices in Singapore, Indonesia, the US, Malaysia, Dubai, Thailand and the Philippines, operates as a global business and may transfer, store, or process your personal data in a country outside your local jurisdiction, including countries outside the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d). However, the company has taken appropriate safeguards with respect to the protection of your privacy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the exercise of your rights. For example, if Darwinbox transfers personal data from the EEA to a country outside it, such as the United States, it will implement an appropriate data transfer solution such as entering into EU standard contractual clauses with the data importer or taking other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection under EU GDPR.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTransfer of data from the US to other countries only happens once Darwinbox determines that the personal data transferred across borders is protected using appropriate safeguards. This includes implementing contractual or other measures to ensure that the recipient provides a level of data protection that is comparable to the protections afforded by the CCPA, as assessed by conducting risk assessments for cross-border transfers. The consumers will be notified of the cross-border transfers of their personal information including the categories of personal information that will be transferred, the countries to which the information will be transferred, and the purposes for which the information will be used. The consumer\u2019s explicit consent will be obtained before making the transfer.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFor the purposes of the processing conducted in the capacity of a processor, Darwinbox is not liable to implement the controls noted above. The implementation of the appropriate safeguards is the responsibility of the data controller which in this case would be the Darwinbox customers. If you are an employee of a business that uses Darwinbox, please contact your employer for questions regarding cross border data transfer.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tData Retention as a Controller/Processor\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDarwinbox in the capacity of controller stores your Personal Information for different time periods depending on the category of Personal Information and the nature of relationship that you have with the company.
