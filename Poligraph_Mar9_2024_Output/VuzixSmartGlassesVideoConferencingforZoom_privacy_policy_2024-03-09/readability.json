This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"privacy-li-1\">1. Collection and Use of Personal Information</h4>\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.</p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Vuzix or an Vuzix Partner. Vuzix and its Partners may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"privacy-li-2\">2. Protection of Personal Information</h4>\n<p>Vuzix takes the security of your personal information very seriously. Vuzix online services protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). In any case, since the Internet is an open network, you must be aware of the possibility that the information can be intercepted, lost, redirected, changed and read by other people. When your personal data is stored by Vuzix, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.</p>\n<p>When you use some Vuzix products, services, or applications or post on an Vuzix forum, public comment, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a comment posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"privacy-li-3\">3. Integrity and Retention of Personal Information</h4>\n<p>Android makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>You have the right to access your personal data and the right to obtain the rectification, erasure or blocking of the data concerning you, whenever such is justified, by contacting Vuzix through the e-mail address indicated below.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"privacy-li-4\">4. International Transfer</h4>\n<p>Your information may be transferred to \u2014 and maintained on \u2014 computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"privacy-li-5\">5. Location-Based Services</h4>\n<p>To provide location-based services, Vuzix and our partners may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer, tablet, smartphone or other device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Vuzix and our partners to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"privacy-li-6\">6. Log Data</h4>\n<p>When you visit the Site, whether as a Vuzix Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a \"Vuzix User\"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (\"Log Data\"). This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"privacy-li-7\">7. Cookies</h4>\n<p>Like many websites, we may use \"cookies\" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer, smartphone or tablet, for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site or Mobile Application. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site or Mobile Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site or Mobile Application and to monitor aggregate usage by Vuzix Users and web traffic routing on the Site or Mobile Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site or Mobile Application and Service. Third party advertisers on the Site or Mobile Application may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or Mobile Application or all functionality of our Services.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"privacy-li-8\">8. Phishing</h4>\n<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as \"phishing\" are of great concern to Vuzix. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or any identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.</p>\n<h3 id=\"terms-li\">B. Terms of Service</h3>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"terms-li-1\">1. Your relationship with Vuzix</h4>\n<p>1.1 Your use of Vuzix\u2019 products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the \u201cServices\u201d in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Vuzix under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Vuzix. Vuzix\u2019 principal place of business is at25 Hendrix Road, West Henrietta, NY, 14586. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.</p>\n<p>1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Vuzix, your agreement with Vuzix will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the \u201cUniversal Terms\u201d.</p>\n<p>1.3 Your agreement with Vuzix will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the \u201cAdditional Terms\u201d. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.</p>\n<p>1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Vuzix in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the \u201cTerms\u201d.</p>\n<p>1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"terms-li-2\">2. Accepting the Terms</h4>\n<p>2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.</p>\n<p>2.2 You can accept the Terms by: (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Vuzix in the user interface for any Service; or (B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Vuzix will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>\n<p>2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Vuzix, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.</p>\n<p>2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"terms-li-3\">3. Language of the Terms</h4>\n<p>3.1 Where Vuzix has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Vuzix.</p>\n<p>3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.</p>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"terms-li-4\">4. Provision of the Services by Vuzix</h4>\n<p>4.1 Vuzix Services enable you to access, browse, purchase and download applications and other digital products for devices running the Android operative system (\"Apps\"). Apps include any content, ads, services, technology, data, in-app products and other digital materials included in or made available through an App (including after you download it). Apps also include any updates, upgrades and other changes and versions that you later use or download from us. The party that provides an App to us for distribution is the \u201cPublisher\u201d of the App. Most of the Apps we make available on the Vuzix Services are provided and licensed to you by third-party Publishers. We may make some Apps available via the Vuzix Services at no charge and others for a price, as further described on our App detail pages.</p>\n<p>4.2 Apps may include offers for digital products that are intended to be accessed or used within an App, such as additional or enhanced functionality, media content, or subscription access to content or services (\u201cIn-App Products\u201d). None of the products and services available for purchase within an App are Vuzix Services. Vuzix is not a party to, and has no responsibility for, any payment or purchase transactions you make through an App.</p>\n<p>4.3 All purchases of Apps are final. We do not accept returns of Apps. Once you have purchased an App, we encourage you to download (if applicable) and access it promptly to be sure you have received it. If you are unable to complete a download or access an App, please contact Vuzix customer service for assistance. Once you purchase an App and we make it available to you, you bear responsibility for completing the download (if applicable) and for all risk of loss after downloading or accessing the App, including any loss due to a mobile device malfunction. We will only accept refund requests made within 24 hours after the purchase.</p>\n<p>4.4 Vuzix may have subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (\u201cSubsidiaries and Affiliates\u201d). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of Vuzix itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.</p>\n<p>4.5 The Publisher of an App may provide an End-User License Agreement (\u201cPublisher\u2019s EULA\u201d) with any App. If there are any conflicts between the Publisher\u2019s EULA and the terms of the End-User License Agreement provided herein (the \u201cStandard EULA\u201d), then to the extent of such conflict the Standard EULA will control. Vuzix does not have any responsibility or liability related to compliance or noncompliance by you or the Publisher under a Publisher\u2019s EULA. The Standard EULA includes the following end user license terms, and if the App does not include a Publisher\u2019s EULA, these terms will constitute the entire EULA between the Publisher and you: (i) The Publisher is the licensor of the App. (ii) If the App does not include a Publisher\u2019s EULA that specifies license rights, Publisher grants the end user a limited, nontransferable license to download and use the App only for personal and noncommercial purposes. (iii) You may not modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the App in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in the App, unless otherwise expressly authorized in writing by Publisher. (iv) The App is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Unless otherwise expressly stated in the Publisher\u2019s EULA, Publisher or its licensors own all title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the App, and the App is licensed, not sold.

All such information is referred to below as the \u201cContent\u201d.</p>\n<p>7.2 You should be aware that Content presented to you as part of the Services, including but not limited to software applications, advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the publishers, sponsors or advertisers who provide that Content to Vuzix (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this Content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Vuzix or by the owners of that Content, in a separate agreement.</p>\n<p>7.3 Vuzix reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service.

Proprietary rights</h4>\n<p>8.1 You acknowledge and agree that Vuzix (or Vuzix\u2019 licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.\n\n1. Collection and Use of Personal Information\nPersonal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.\nYou may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Vuzix or an Vuzix Partner. Vuzix and its Partners may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.\n\n2. Protection of Personal Information\nVuzix takes the security of your personal information very seriously. Vuzix online services protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). In any case, since the Internet is an open network, you must be aware of the possibility that the information can be intercepted, lost, redirected, changed and read by other people. When your personal data is stored by Vuzix, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWhen you use some Vuzix products, services, or applications or post on an Vuzix forum, public comment, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a comment posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.\n\n3. Integrity and Retention of Personal Information\nAndroid makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\nYou have the right to access your personal data and the right to obtain the rectification, erasure or blocking of the data concerning you, whenever such is justified, by contacting Vuzix through the e-mail address indicated below.\n\n4. International Transfer\nYour information may be transferred to \u2014 and maintained on \u2014 computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.\n\n5. Location-Based Services\nTo provide location-based services, Vuzix and our partners may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer, tablet, smartphone or other device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Vuzix and our partners to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.\n\n6. Log Data\nWhen you visit the Site, whether as a Vuzix Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a \"Vuzix User\"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (\"Log Data\"). This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.

Cookies\nLike many websites, we may use \"cookies\" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer, smartphone or tablet, for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site or Mobile Application. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site or Mobile Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site or Mobile Application and to monitor aggregate usage by Vuzix Users and web traffic routing on the Site or Mobile Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site or Mobile Application and Service. Third party advertisers on the Site or Mobile Application may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or Mobile Application or all functionality of our Services.\n\n8. Phishing\nIdentity theft and the practice currently known as \"phishing\" are of great concern to Vuzix. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or any identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.\nB.
