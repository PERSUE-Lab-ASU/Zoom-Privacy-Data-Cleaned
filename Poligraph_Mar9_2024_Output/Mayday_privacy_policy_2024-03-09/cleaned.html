That's why we take privacy so seriously at Mayday. We've done our best to lay out our practices and principles related to your data in plain language. This policy provides details about what personal information we collect, why we collect it, and how we handle and use your personal information while it’s entrusted to us. This policy covers our Website (<a href="http://www.mayday.am/">www.mayday.am</a>) as well as all products built and maintained by Mayday Labs Inc. (Mayday).</p><p>In short, your privacy matters to us and we always strive to protect it. Your data is yours and we’re not in the business of selling it.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>THE&nbsp;INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY </strong></h4><p>At Mayday, we provide smart calendaring software that allows you to view and manage your calendar data with the purpose of helping you to optimize how you're spending your time.</p><p>We only collect the personal information we need and only store it for as little time as necessary to meet the purposes for which it was collected. We may collect personal information when you:</p><ul role="list"><li>Create an account</li><li>Use the App</li><li>Sign-up to receive marketing communications</li><li>Participate in our surveys</li><li>Contact us with a comment, question or complaint</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Create an account</strong>: You do not have to register to visit or use our Website, but you will be required to create an account in order to use our App. To create your account, we require certain information such as your first and last name, email address and a password that you create, as well as the information required to integrate with and connect to your chosen calendar software. We use this information to create and administer your account and facilitate your use of the App.</p><p><strong>Use the App</strong>: When you use our App to view, manage, and analyze your calendar, we will collect the following personal information: calendar data, including meeting dates and times, the names and emails of meeting attendees, meeting locations and addresses, and any description of meetings contained in the calendar. We use this information to facilitate your use of the App and its features, including to allow you to view and manage your calendar events, respond to and send meeting invitations, and use the various calendar management functions provided by the App. We use your information to understand the activities and events that are important to you, and to make targeted recommendations for how to best optimize your time. Your App usage information will also be used to understand activity on our App with the intention to monitor performance and to improve the App experience for users.</p><p>As with many applications, certain limited data is required for the App to function on your device. This data includes the type of device hardware and operating system, unique device identiﬁers associated with your device, your mobile carrier, IP address, language settings, and the date and time the App accesses our servers, as well as other system configuration information and metadata associated with electronic interactions between your devices and our App. We use this information to monitor and improve the quality of our App, to tailor your in-App experience, and to manage and analyze data in order to better understand our users.</p><p>With your consent, we may also collect your location information by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates so that we can allow you to make changes to event locations and to manage and view travel time and directions to event locations. You can opt-out at any time by turning off your location services for the App either within the App or in the settings of your mobile device.</p><p><strong>Sign up to receive marketing communications</strong>: If you sign-up to receive email marketing communications such as newsletters, we collect your email address as well as other information on an optional basis to help us tailor our communications to you. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included at the bottom of each email. Alternatively, you can opt-out of receiving email marketing communications by contacting us at the contact information provided in the “Contact Us” section below. Please note that you may continue to receive transactional or account-related communications from us.</p><p>If you provide your consent to receive push notifications, we may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide you with App updates and other relevant information such as meeting and event invitations, and alerts about conflicts in your calendar or to-do items from your Spotlight page. If you wish to stop receiving push notifications from us, you can turn off push notifications for the App either within the App or in the settings of your mobile device.</p><p><strong>Participate in surveys:</strong> From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in one of our surveys. The information obtained through our surveys is used in an aggregated, de-identified form. We use this information to help us understand our users and to enhance our website, products and services.</p><p><strong>Contact us</strong>: When you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you, such as your name and email address<strong> </strong>along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment. &nbsp;We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and service offerings.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>WHEN WE ACCESS AND&nbsp;SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h4><p>Our default practice is to not access your information. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as set forth below or as required or permitted by law. The only times we’ll ever access or share your info are:</p><p><strong>To provide the products or services you’ve requested:</strong> We use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your identity information via these third parties. Your personal information will be transferred (or otherwise made available) to certain third party service providers that provide services on our behalf. We use these service providers to provide services such as hosting the Website, publishing the App, providing authentication and integration services, conducting analytics, providing customer support services, and providing advertising and marketing services. Our service providers are only provided with the information they need to perform their designated functions and are not authorized to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes. Our service providers may be located in the U.S., Canada or other foreign jurisdictions.</p><p><strong>To help you troubleshoot bugs, with your permission: </strong>If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.</p><p><strong>When required under applicable law: </strong>We and our Canadian, US and other foreign service providers may provide your personal information in response to a search warrant to other legally valid inquiry or order, or to another organization for the purposes of investigating a breach of an agreement or contravention of law or detecting, suppressing or preventing fraud, or as otherwise may be required or permitted by applicable Canadian, U.S. or other law or legal process, which may include lawful access by US or foreign courts, law enforcement or other government authorities. Your personal information may also be disclosed where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and to investigate or prevent actual or suspected loss or harm to persons or property.</p><p><strong>In the event that the business is acquired</strong>: While this isn’t our primary goal, we may one day participate in a merger or acquisition (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of our company, which may necessitate the transfer of personal information as an asset in connection with the acquisition, merger, reorganization or other change in corporate control.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ACCESS OUR WEBSITE</strong></h4><p><strong>Visiting our Website:</strong> In general, you can visit our Website (<a href="http://www.mayday.am/">www.mayday.am</a>) without telling us who you are or submitting any personal information.

You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to not accept certain cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from our Website, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the Website features.</p><p><strong>Analytics</strong>: We may also use a third party such as Google Analytics to help us gather and analyze information about the areas visited on the Website (such as the pages most read, time spent, search terms and other engagement data) in order to evaluate and improve the user experience and the Website. You can prevent the storage of data relating to your use of the Website and created via the cookie (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.

We restrict access to personal information on a need-to-know basis to employees and authorized service providers who require access to fulfil their job requirements.</p><p>We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (such as letters, phone calls or email messages).

In order to minimize our data storage needs, we routinely purge your historic calendar data from our system. This means that when an account is in use, we only keep a few weeks (into the past and into the future) of your calendar data in our database at any given time.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>YOUR ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION</strong></h4><p>Subject to applicable law, you have the right to access, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal information in our custody or control.
