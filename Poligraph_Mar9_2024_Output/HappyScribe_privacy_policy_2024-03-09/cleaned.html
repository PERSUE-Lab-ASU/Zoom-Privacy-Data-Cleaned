<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>About Us</h3>

<p>Happy Scribe Limited ("<strong>Happy Scribe</strong>") is a private company limited
by shares incorporated in Ireland with company number 604917 and having
a registered office at The Black Church, Saint Mary's Place North,
Dublin 7 ("<strong>we</strong>"/"<strong>us</strong>"/"<strong>our</strong>"). We provide transcription,
subtitling and translation services to our customers (the
"<strong>Services</strong>") through our online platform at
<a href="https://www.happyscribe.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.happyscribe.com</a>
(the "<strong>Website</strong>").</p>

<h3>About this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>Data protection refers to the safeguarding of personal data, as defined
by the General Data Protection Regulation ("<strong>GDPR</strong>"), which
encompasses any information pertaining to an identified or identifiable
natural person. An identifiable natural person is someone who can be
directly or indirectly identified, particularly through an identifier
such as a name, identification number, or other specific attributes.
This Privacy Policy (the "<strong>Policy</strong>") outlines crucial information
about your rights concerning the processing of your personal data for
the purpose of using the website. It also specifies the basis on which
any personal data we collect from you.</p>

<p>In compliance with data protection regulations, your personal data will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be used in a legal, fair, and transparent manner.</li>
<li>Only be collected for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you
and will not be used in a manner incompatible with those purposes.</li>
<li>Be relevant to the purposes we have disclosed to you and limited only to those purposes.</li>
<li>Be accurate and up to date.</li>
<li>Be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we have indicated to you.</li>
<li>Be kept and stored securely.</li>
</ul>

<p>We take our responsibilities seriously with regard to the processing of
personal data. Please note that our Website may contain links to
third-party websites. If you follow a link to any of those third-party
websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that
we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies or
processing of your personal information. Please check these policies
before you submit any personal information to such third-party websites.</p>

<p>The Website is not aimed at children under 16 years of age. We do not
knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you

providing, and to the extent necessary to provide, the Services to
you. There are special requirements set out under Chapter V of the
GDPR (with which we would comply) to regulate such data transfers and
ensure that adequate security measures are in place to safeguard and

<a href="mailto:dataprotection@happyscribe.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>dataprotection@happyscribe.co</strong></a></p>

<h3>e) Keeping Data Secure</h3>

<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access
to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only
process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to
a duty of confidentiality.</p>

<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

<h3>f) Your Rights</h3>

<p>As a Data Subject, you have the following rights:</p>

<p><strong>Right of Access</strong><br>
You may request access at any time to a copy of the personal data we hold about you. Any such request should be submitted to us in writing and sent to <strong><a href="mailto:dataprotection@happyscribe.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dataprotection@happyscribe.co</a></strong>. We will need to verify your identity in such circumstances and may request more information or clarifications from you if needed to help us locate and provide you with the personal data requested.</p>

<p>There is usually no charge applied to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Right of Restriction</strong><br>
You may restrict us from processing your personal data in any of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have contested the accuracy of the personal data we hold on record in relation to you or for a period of time to enable us to verify the accuracy of the personal data;</li>
<li>the processing of your personal data is unlawful and you request the restriction of use of the personal data instead of its erasure;</li>
<li>we no longer require your personal data for the purpose of processing but you require this data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or</li>
<li>where you have contested the processing (under Article 21(1) of the GDPR) pending the verification of our legitimate grounds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Right of Rectification and Right to be Forgotten</strong><br>
If we hold personal data concerning you which are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or if you withdraw consent for us to process your personal data, you can request the deletion of this personal data. This right, however, will not apply where we are required to process personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation or where the processing of this information is carried out for reasons of public interest in the area of public health. If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request to have your personal information updated and corrected. To do so at any time, please contact us by email at <strong><a href="mailto:dataprotection@happyscribe.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dataprotection@happyscribe.co</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Right to Data Portability</strong><br>
 Where we process your personal data by automated means (i.e., not on paper) and this processing is based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract between us, you have the right to request from us a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format and, where technically feasible, to request that we transmit your personal data in this format to another controller.</p>

<p><strong>Right to Object</strong><br>
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time:</p>

<ul>
<li>for direct marketing purposes</li>
<li>for profiling to the extent it relates to direct marketing</li>
<li>where we process your personal data for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by us, except where we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for this processing which would override your interests, rights and freedoms or in connection with the enforcement or defence of a legal claim.</li>
</ul>

<p>To exercise your right to object at any time, please email <strong><a href="mailto:dataprotection@happyscribe.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dataprotection@happyscribe.co</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Should this occur, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes unless doing so is justified by a compelling legitimate ground as described above. For more information about our marketing practices, please see the Marketing Communications section below.</p>

<p>The rights described in this section are personal rights and are
exercisable only by the individual person (or data subject) concerned.</p>

<h2>g) Marketing Communications</h2>

<p><strong>General.</strong></p>

<p>We will process your personal data to send you marketing
communications regarding products or similar services to those
initially contracted.</p>

<p><strong>Your right to object.</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data
for our marketing communications by contacting us at
<strong><a href="mailto:dataprotection@happyscribe.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dataprotection@happyscribe.co</a>.</strong> You may also opt out of receiving
marketing communications at any time by selecting the unsubscribe
option when you receive an electronic marketing communication from us.</p>

<h2>h) How Long We Keep Your Information:</h2>

<p>We will only retain your
personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we
collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any
legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. This means that the
period of time for which we store your personal data may depend on
the type of data we hold. To determine the appropriate retention
period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from
unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes
for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
requirements. For more information about our data retention
policies please contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:dataprotection@happyscribe.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dataprotection@happyscribe.co</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>i) If You Fail To Provide Personal Data.</strong></p>

<p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a
contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when
requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are
trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with our
Services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service
you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the
time.</p>

<p>We store the data for the duration of the contract term and, if
applicable, for the duration of statutory retention periods. We will
delete your account upon your request after the cancellation of the
account.</p>

<h2>II. CONTENT DATA</h2>

<p>In order for us to provide you with our Services, you will need to
share with us texts, audios or video files (hereinafter, "<strong>Content"</strong>
) for us to provide transcription, subtitling and translation. Such
Content may include personal data. If this is the case, we will
process personal data included in the Content acting as what's known
under the GDPR as the "Processor" and while doing so we will comply
with the following obligations:</p>

<h3>a) Data Processing</h3>

<p>We will only process personal data included in
the Content within the scope of the services we offer, excluding
any use for our own purposes or for statistical purposes.</p>

<p>We will only grant access to personal data to those employees and/or
third parties necessary for providing services to you. We guarantee
that our employees and/or third parties are informed of the processing
they can carry out with respect to the data provided by you and have
the necessary training and expertise in data protection to provide the
contracted services. We will ensure the confidentiality of the data
and respect the security measures implemented. You reserve the right
to monitor the actions of our employees through internal measures.</p>

<p>We, including our employees and/or third parties, commit to not
disclose, transfer, assign, or communicate the files or personal data
contained therein to any third party, verbally, in writing,
electronically, on paper, or through computer access, not even for
their preservation, without prior written authorization from you and
always within the scope and purpose of this agreement.</p>

<h3>b) Security Measures</h3>

<p>We undertake to adopt the technical and
organizational measures that may be necessary to ensure the
security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal data. We will
also prevent their alteration, loss, processing, or unauthorized
access, taking into account at all times the state of technology,
the nature of the data, and the risks to which they are exposed.</p>

<h3>c) Notification of Incidents/Security Breaches</h3>

<p>In the event of a
security incident, such as destruction, loss, modification,
accidental disclosure, unauthorized or illegal access to personal
data ("<strong>Security Incident or Breach</strong>"), we, as Processor,
shall notify you, as Controller, without undue delay of any
breaches of the security of personal data, together with all
relevant information for documentation and communication of the
incident. Notification shall not be required when it is unlikely
that such security breach constitutes a risk to the rights and
freedoms of natural persons.</p>

<h3>d) Subcontractor</h3>

<p>In the event that we engage another Processor, we
will inform you by updating this Policy. We will formalize a
written service provision contract with each subcontracted
company. The contract must ensure compliance with the obligations
set forth in this Policy, as well as the same security and other
conditions established. In this way, the subcontractor, who will
also have the status of Processor, is equally obliged to comply
with similar obligations as we, as Processor. For more information
about subprocessors, please contact us by email at
<a href="mailto:dataprotection@happyscribe.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>dataprotection@happyscribe.co</strong></a></p>

<h3>e) International data transfer</h3>

<p>Personal Data may be transferred to
our trusted partners and service providers who maintain their
servers outside of the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>"), where
the privacy and data protection laws may not be as protective as
those in your jurisdiction, in accordance with Articles 45 and 46
of the GDPR. This is only for the purposes of providing, and to
the extent necessary to provide, the Services to you. There are
special requirements set out under Chapter V of the GDPR (with
which we would comply) to regulate such data transfers and ensure
that adequate security measures are in place to safeguard and
maintain the integrity of your personal data on transfer. For more
information about this and the safeguards in place relating to the
transfer, please contact us by email at
<a href="mailto:dataprotection@happyscribe.co" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>dataprotection@happyscribe.co</strong></a></p>

<h3>f) Retention, Return and Deletion of Personal Data</h3>

<p>Upon termination or expiration of the relationship between the parties
(whether due to closure of the user\'s account or at their express
request), we will return or destroy all personal data of the
Content that you have provided us for the provision of the
Services. However, this obligation will not apply if, due to
applicable regulations, we need to retain such data.</p>

<p>We will be able to store the Content for training our machine learning
algorithms. This will allow us to continuously improve the quality of
our service for you. All personal data in the Content that we stored
will be anonymised.</p>

<h3>g) Professional secrecy/confidentiality</h3>

<p>We are bound by
professional secrecy with respect to any personal data to which we
have access due to our provision of Services to the Controller.
This obligation will continue even after the relationship between
the parties has ended, thus constituting an indefinite obligation.</p>

<p>You, as the data controller, represent and warrant that the personal
data included in the content has been collected in accordance with
applicable laws, and that the disclosure of such personal data to us for
the purposes mentioned herein is compliant with applicable laws.</p>

<h2>III. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<h3>Third Party Material</h3>

<p>We always endeavour to deal with vendors and other third parties who are
GDPR compliant or, in the case of the third parties located outside of
the EEA, who have adequate security measures in place to safeguard the
security of personal data. We comply with all the GDPR requirements when
engaging with those third parties. That said, we, our employees and
agents accept no liability however arising for the content or
reliability of any third-party materials or websites referenced by
hyperlink or other means on the Site or for the data collection and use
practices or security measures used by such third parties. If you submit
personal data to any of those sites, your personal data is governed by
their privacy policy. We encourage you to carefully read their privacy
policies.</p>

<h3>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We reserve the right to change this Policy as we may deem necessary from
time to time or as may be required by law. Any changes will be posted on
the Website and you are deemed to have accepted the terms of the Policy
on your first use of the Website following the alterations. If required
under the applicable laws, we will inform you of any material change of
this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Change of Purpose</h3>

<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new
