Such data is processed by Useful for its own purposes (as described in above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our Customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.</p><p>Accordingly, Useful processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with our Customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our data processing addendum and other commercial agreements with such Customer.</p><p>Our Customers are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services, and for ensuring that all individuals using the Services on the Customer\u2019s behalf or at their request, as well as all individuals whose personal data may be included in Customer Data processed through the Services, have been provided with adequate notice and given informed consent to the processing of their personal data, where such consent is necessary or advised, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording, use or other processing of data through our Services are fully met by the Customer, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship.
