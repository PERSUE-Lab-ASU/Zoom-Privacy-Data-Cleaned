To Communicate with You About the Product and Services</strong></p>\n            <p>We use the account information you provide to CrmOne when signing up for the Subscription Service and\n                Trends services to send you transactional emails or in-app notification about billing, account\n                management, and other administrative matters.

To Provide the Subscription Service</strong></p>\n            <p>We use your account information and Customer Data to provide the product and services to you. For\n                example, we use the email address you provide when signing up for the product to create your user\n                account, and we use your payment information to process payments for paid use of the Subscription\n                Service. We also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer\n                support.</p>\n            <p><strong>c. To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services</strong></p>\n            <p>We collect usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services. We use this\n                data to develop and improve our products and services.

When\n                we share statistical information externally in this way, the data will be aggregated and we will not\n                identify individual users or customers. For example, we may publish blog posts on trends or insights\n                into how users are interacting with our product. </p>\n            <p><strong>d.

This includes enforcing our Customer\n                Terms of Service..</p>\n            <p>We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how\n                you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and\n                regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also\n                collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns,\n                investigate security events and incidents.

For example, we use the information, like your email or physical address, to send\n                information or CrmOne content to you which we think may be of interest to you by post, email, or\n                other means and send you marketing communications relating to our business.</p>\n            <p>You may opt out of receiving this promotional content by following the instructions contained in each\n                communication that we send to you or by contacting us <a href=\"mailto:connect@crmone.com\">connect@crmone.com.</a> If you unsubscribe from\n                our marketing lists, we will continue to contact you regarding administrative matters, and to\n                respond to your requests.</p>\n            <p>We may also reach out to you via telephone to ask about other CrmOne products or services you may be\n                interested in. If you have a call scheduled with a CrmOne representative, we may record and\n                transcribe the call. You will be notified prior to the call that the call is being recorded, and you\n                will be offered an opportunity to opt-out of having the call recorded.</p>\n            <p>Where required by law, we will only send marketing communications with your consent.

Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (EEA and UK visitors only) </strong></p>\n            <p>If you are a website visitor located in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d),\n                CrmOne Ireland Limited is the data controller of your Personal Data. CrmOne\u2019s Data Protection\n                Officer can be contacted Customer Terms of Service.</p>\n            <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the\n                Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally\n                collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal\n                Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not\n                overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we\n                may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.</p>\n            <p>If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract\n                with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your\n                Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide\n                your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our\n                legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time\n                what those legitimate interests are.</p>\n            <p>3. How We Share Personal Data</p>\n            <p><strong>a. Service Providers </strong></p>\n            <p>We may share Personal Data with our third party service providers to support our websites, products,\n                and services. For example, we use service providers for data hosting, application development,\n                marketing, sales support and customer support. We may need to share your information with service\n                providers to provide information about products or services to you. Examples may include removing\n                repetitive information from prospect lists, analysing data or performing statistical analysis on\n                your use of the Subscription Service or interactions on our websites, providing marketing\n                assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order\n                to provide you with better service, developing and improving the product and services, and providing\n                customer service or support. These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Data\n                except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your\n                information. In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the\n                third party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies\n                and standards.</p>\n            <p><strong>b. Partners </strong></p>\n            <p>We may share data with trusted CrmOne partners to contact you based on your request to receive such\n                communications, help us perform statistical analysis, provide sales support, or provide customer\n                support. Partners are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they\n                are required to maintain the confidentiality of your data.</p>\n            <p>We also partner with trusted third parties to provide you with co-marketing content that we think may\n                be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners, we will tell you who we are\n                sharing data with, and provide a link to the co-marketing partner\u2019s privacy policy so you can learn\n                more about how to opt-out of the partner\u2019s communications. These co-marketing partners are required\n                to adhere to our privacy and data protection policies. </p>\n            <p><strong>c. Corporate Events </strong></p>\n            <p>If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or\n                otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by CrmOne on the websites and the\n                Subscription Service. In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our\n                website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding\n                your Personal Data.</p>\n            <p><strong>d. Public Forums</strong></p>\n            <p>Our websites may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums (e.g. CrmOne\n                Community and Connect.com). Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information\n                through our public message boards, blogs, or forums (including profile information associated with\n                the account you use to post the information) it may be read, collected and used by any member of the\n                public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after\n                you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you may\n                disclose in this way. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the websites if\n                you so request, as described in Section 7 \u201cYour Privacy Rights and Choices\u201d below. In some cases, we\n                may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to\n                and why.</p>\n            <p><strong>e. Compelled Disclosure</strong></p>\n            <p>We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably\n                believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety\n                of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process. If you use the\n                Subscription Service, Customer Data is considered Confidential Information and you should review the\n                Confidentiality terms in the Customer Terms of Service for more information.

How We Transfer Personal Data Internationally</p>\n            <p><strong>a. International Transfers within the CrmOne Group</strong></p>\n            <p>To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer information to other CrmOne Affiliates where we\n                have operations for the purposes described in this policy. Please see Customer Terms of Service for\n                a list of CrmOne Affiliates and their locations. </p>\n            <p>This Privacy Policy will apply even if we transfer Personal Data to other countries. We have taken\n                appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected wherever it is\n                transferred. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d),\n                Switzerland or the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) within and among CrmOne\u2019s Affiliates, we make use of the\n                EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy\n                Framework (collectively, the \u201cData Privacy Framework\u201d). We also implement the Standard Contractual\n                Clauses (approved by the European Commission and Swiss authorities) and UK Addendum to the Standard\n                Contractual Clauses (approved by the UK authorities) where required, as well as additional\n                safeguards where appropriate (such as commercial industry standard secure encryption methods to\n                protect customer data at rest and in transit, TLS for CrmOne hosted sites, web application firewall\n                protection, and other appropriate contractual and organisational measures), Please see our Data\n                Privacy Framework below for more information.</p>\n            <p><strong>b. International transfers to third parties</strong></p>\n            <p>Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under\n                contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws\n                to the country in which you reside. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA,\n                Switzerland or UK with third parties, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer\n                including the European Commission-approved Data Privacy Framework Standard Contractual Clauses, as\n                well as additional safeguards where appropriate. For transfers to or from the United Kingdom, we\n                make use of the UK Addendum. For transfers to or from Canada, we make use of the standard\n                contractual clauses. With respect to personal data received from or transferred to Canada, CrmOne is\n                subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.\n                Please contact us if you need more information about the legal mechanisms we rely on to transfer\n                personal data outside the EEA, Switzerland, Canada, and UK.</p>\n            <p><strong>c.

CrmOne shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if our agent processes your Personal\n                Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless CrmOne is not responsible for the\n                event giving rise to the damage.</p>\n            <p>Please note that under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in\n                response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law\n                enforcement requirements.</p>\n            <p>5.

We retain Personal Data that you provide to us\n                where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, as needed to comply with\n                our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements).</p>\n            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we securely delete\n                the information or anonymize it or, if this is not possible, securely store your Personal Data and\n                isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

You\n                can learn more about how we access this data HERE or via in-app notice when you connect to Gmail.\n            \n            By using the Gmail integration with the Subscription Service you will grant the Subscription Service\n                access to information associated with your account, including contacts, emails, calendar,\n                distribution lists, subject lines, and URLs of tracked links from your email, if you use the email\n                tracking functionality. In addition, the Subscription Service will be able to read, modify, create,\n                and send emails from your connected Gmail account. The Subscription Service will scan the content of\n                your emails to identify which emails you have elected to track in order to provide you with the\n                notifications feature. The Subscription Service will store replies, outgoing mail, email headers,\n                subject line, distribution lists, aliases, time sent, and email bodies.

You understand that the correspondences you track will be visible to other\n                users on your Subscription team.\n            If you connect your Gmail account via IMAP (or Generic Inbox Connection), the Subscription Service\n                will have access only to email address, password, server information, email metadata, and message\n                bodies. Additionally, connecting your Gmail account via IMAP does not require you to connect any\n                other Google Workspace applications.\n            Additional Limits on Use of Your Google User Data\n            CrmOne\u2019s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to\n                the Google\n                    API Services User Data Policy , including the Limited Use requirements.\n            Google Calendar Integration\n            The Subscription Service will have access to both your Google Calendar and any other calendar you\n                access via Google in order to power our Meetings tool, and allow you to associate events with\n                contacts in your CrmOne account. The Subscription Service will have the ability to: create or change\n                your calendars, and update individual calendar events.\n            d.

For more information about our co-marketing program and how we share data with our partners\n                please see below and read about our co-marketing program under the channel partner policies.\n            Third Parties \n            We may receive information from third party service providers, from related companies, and from our\n                business and solution partners.\n            Personal Data from Different Sources\n            We may combine the personal information we collect from you with personal information we receive from\n                other sources, such as third party providers of business information and publicly available sources\n                (like social media platforms). This may include physical mail addresses, job titles, email\n                addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and social media profiles. This helps us to update and\n                improve our records, identify new customers, create more personalised advertising, suggest products\n                and services that may interest you, deliver personalised communications and promote events. The\n                collection of your Personal Data by these other third party providers is governed by the provider\u2019s\n                privacy policy.\n            Log Files \n            Like most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, we automatically collect and\n                store information about your computer hardware and software when you visit our websites, use our\n                product and services, or visit other sites or services that link to this Privacy Policy. This\n                information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, internet service provider\n                (ISP), and the files viewed on our websites (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), the files viewed on\n                our, or our customer\u2019s websites (if those websites are hosted on CrmOne e.g. HTML pages or, graphics\n                etc), your operating system, access times and referring website addresses. \n            When you use the Subscription Service, we collect and store the categories of information listed\n                above in logs in the following instances, subject to the customer\u2019s implementation settings:\n            \n                \n                    When a CrmOne user logs into their account and accesses tools in the CrmOne Platform;\n                \n                \n                    When an individual visits a customer\u2019s website, if the website is hosted by the CrmOne product;\n                    or\n                \n                \n                    When an individual visits a customer\u2019s website, if the customer\u2019s website is self-hosted, if the\n                    customer uses our plug-ins, and the customer uses CrmOne scripts and content (such as embedded\n                    forms).\n                \n            \n            Buttons, tools, and content from other companies\n            Our websites may include features and widgets (such as the share and/or \u201clike\u201d button or interactive\n                mini-programs) that run on our websites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you\n                are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These\n                features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. This\n                Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed\n                by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them. You can learn more about\n                data collected by Google and what this data is used for in Google\u2019s Privacy Policy. Additional information\n                on Google services and products is available in Google\u2019s Terms of Service. \n            Other CrmOne Companies\n            We may receive information about you from other companies that are owned or operated by CrmOne.\n            2. How We Use Personal Data\n            a. To Communicate with You About the Product and Services\n            We use the account information you provide to CrmOne when signing up for the Subscription Service and\n                Trends services to send you transactional emails or in-app notification about billing, account\n                management, and other administrative matters. We may also send you updates regarding our Customer\n                Terms of Service or other legal agreements, and may also communicate with you about security\n                incidents via email or in-app notification. \n            We use your information to provide customer support, such as resolving technical issues you encounter\n                and analysing product outages or bugs.\n            If you use the CrmOne mobile applications, we may send you push notifications from time to time in\n                order to update you about events and promotions. If you no longer wish to receive such\n                communications, you may turn them off at the device level.\n            b. To Provide the Subscription Service\n            We use your account information and Customer Data to provide the product and services to you. For\n                example, we use the email address you provide when signing up for the product to create your user\n                account, and we use your payment information to process payments for paid use of the Subscription\n                Service. We also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer\n                support.\n            c. To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services\n            We collect usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services. We use this\n                data to develop and improve our products and services. For example, we use usage data to assess\n                trends and usage across the product to help us determine what new features or integrations our users\n                may be interested in. \n            We use Customer Data for machine learning that supports certain products and development of features\n                and functionality with the Subscription Service and similar products and services. For example,\n                machine learning helps power the business card scanner tool if you use our mobile apps and allows\n                for easier imports of data into your CrmOne account. You may opt-out of having your Customer Data\n                used for machine learning by emailing at connect@crmone.com \n            We may publish data about how our product and services are being used across our customer base. When\n                we share statistical information externally in this way, the data will be aggregated and we will not\n                identify individual users or customers. For example, we may publish blog posts on trends or insights\n                into how users are interacting with our product. \n            d. To Secure and Protect our Product and CrmOne Users\n            We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents. We may also use\n                this information to meet legal requirements. We use your information to verify user accounts, new\n                product sign-ups, and to detect and prevent product abuse. This includes enforcing our Customer\n                Terms of Service..\n            We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how\n                you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and\n                regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also\n                collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns,\n                investigate security events and incidents. For these purposes we do link this\n                automatically-collected data to other personal data provided by you such as name, email address,\n                address, and phone number. \n            e. To Market and Promote the Subscription Service\n            We use the information you provide to CrmOne to market and promote the products, services, and other\n                offerings. For example, we use the information, like your email or physical address, to send\n                information or CrmOne content to you which we think may be of interest to you by post, email, or\n                other means and send you marketing communications relating to our business.\n            You may opt out of receiving this promotional content by following the instructions contained in each\n                communication that we send to you or by contacting us connect@crmone.com. If you unsubscribe from\n                our marketing lists, we will continue to contact you regarding administrative matters, and to\n                respond to your requests.\n            We may also reach out to you via telephone to ask about other CrmOne products or services you may be\n                interested in. If you have a call scheduled with a CrmOne representative, we may record and\n                transcribe the call. You will be notified prior to the call that the call is being recorded, and you\n                will be offered an opportunity to opt-out of having the call recorded.\n            Where required by law, we will only send marketing communications with your consent. Otherwise, we\n                will market and advertise our products and services on the basis of our legitimate business\n                interests.\n            We receive information from third party service providers and other sources such as third party\n                providers of business information and publicly available sources. We may receive and use this\n                information from these service providers and other sources in combination with other information we\n                collect through other means described in this Privacy Policy for the purposes of providing you with\n                updates and an improved Subscription Service, like personalised communications, event promotion, and\n                tailoring the websites or product to improve user experience.\n            f. Other purposes if we obtain your consent\n            We share your data with third parties when you give us consent to do so.\n            g. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (EEA and UK visitors only) \n            If you are a website visitor located in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d),\n                CrmOne Ireland Limited is the data controller of your Personal Data. CrmOne\u2019s Data Protection\n                Officer can be contacted Customer Terms of Service.\n            Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the\n                Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally\n                collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal\n                Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not\n                overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we\n                may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.\n            If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract\n                with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your\n                Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide\n                your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our\n                legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time\n                what those legitimate interests are.\n            3. How We Share Personal Data\n            a. Service Providers \n            We may share Personal Data with our third party service providers to support our websites, products,\n                and services. For example, we use service providers for data hosting, application development,\n                marketing, sales support and customer support. We may need to share your information with service\n                providers to provide information about products or services to you. Examples may include removing\n                repetitive information from prospect lists, analysing data or performing statistical analysis on\n                your use of the Subscription Service or interactions on our websites, providing marketing\n                assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order\n                to provide you with better service, developing and improving the product and services, and providing\n                customer service or support. These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Data\n                except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your\n                information. In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the\n                third party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies\n                and standards.\n            b. Partners \n            We may share data with trusted CrmOne partners to contact you based on your request to receive such\n                communications, help us perform statistical analysis, provide sales support, or provide customer\n                support. Partners are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they\n                are required to maintain the confidentiality of your data.\n            We also partner with trusted third parties to provide you with co-marketing content that we think may\n                be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners, we will tell you who we are\n                sharing data with, and provide a link to the co-marketing partner\u2019s privacy policy so you can learn\n                more about how to opt-out of the partner\u2019s communications. These co-marketing partners are required\n                to adhere to our privacy and data protection policies. \n            c. Corporate Events \n            If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or\n                otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by CrmOne on the websites and the\n                Subscription Service. In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our\n                website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding\n                your Personal Data.\n            d. Public Forums\n            Our websites may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums (e.g. CrmOne\n                Community and Connect.com). Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information\n                through our public message boards, blogs, or forums (including profile information associated with\n                the account you use to post the information) it may be read, collected and used by any member of the\n                public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after\n                you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you may\n                disclose in this way. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the websites if\n                you so request, as described in Section 7 \u201cYour Privacy Rights and Choices\u201d below. In some cases, we\n                may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to\n                and why.\n            e. Compelled Disclosure\n            We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably\n                believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety\n                of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process. If you use the\n                Subscription Service, Customer Data is considered Confidential Information and you should review the\n                Confidentiality terms in the Customer Terms of Service for more information. CrmOne shares data\n                about requests for customer information, to learn more see our Customer Terms of Service.\n            4. How We Transfer Personal Data Internationally\n            a. International Transfers within the CrmOne Group\n            To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer information to other CrmOne Affiliates where we\n                have operations for the purposes described in this policy. Please see Customer Terms of Service for\n                a list of CrmOne Affiliates and their locations. \n            This Privacy Policy will apply even if we transfer Personal Data to other countries. We have taken\n                appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected wherever it is\n                transferred. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d),\n                Switzerland or the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) within and among CrmOne\u2019s Affiliates, we make use of the\n                EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy\n                Framework (collectively, the \u201cData Privacy Framework\u201d). We also implement the Standard Contractual\n                Clauses (approved by the European Commission and Swiss authorities) and UK Addendum to the Standard\n                Contractual Clauses (approved by the UK authorities) where required, as well as additional\n                safeguards where appropriate (such as commercial industry standard secure encryption methods to\n                protect customer data at rest and in transit, TLS for CrmOne hosted sites, web application firewall\n                protection, and other appropriate contractual and organisational measures), Please see our Data\n                Privacy Framework below for more information.\n            b. International transfers to third parties\n            Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under\n                contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws\n                to the country in which you reside. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA,\n                Switzerland or UK with third parties, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer\n                including the European Commission-approved Data Privacy Framework Standard Contractual Clauses, as\n                well as additional safeguards where appropriate.
