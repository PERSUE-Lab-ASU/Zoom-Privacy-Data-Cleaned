Sometimes the third parties we work with place or recognize a unique cookie or other tracking technology on your browser and may also use technology to measure and track effectiveness of ads. You can learn more about ad-serving companies and the options available to limit their collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="https://youradchoices.com/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>.

Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Site or Service, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content may not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out pages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites, available at the above links.</p></li><li><p><strong>Analytics Cookies.</strong> We may engage third parties to help analyze how people use the Site and Service, compile reports, and improve the quality and relevance of the Site and Service.

If we anonymize, aggregate, or de-identify Personal Information, we may use and disclose it for any business purpose.

Everlaw is headquartered in the US and has offices, employees, and service providers who operate around the globe. To provide the Service, Everlaw may store, process, and transmit Personal Information to countries outside of your location, including but not limited to the US, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. Data may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances.</p><p>Depending on your location, when we transfer your Personal Information we rely on certain legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer, as required by law. If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, this may include transferring your Personal Information to adequate countries or using the European Commission’s&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en">SCCs</a>&nbsp;and UK addendum and any additional safeguards as necessary.</p><h2><strong>Your Privacy Rights</strong></h2><p>Depending on your location, you may have statutory rights in and to your Personal Information.

We respond to all requests in accordance with Applicable Privacy Law, and we may need to verify your identity before we can respond to your request.

It provides additional information as to how you may exercise your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”).</p><p><strong>Information We Collect.&nbsp;</strong>This Privacy Notice already describes the information we collect and the sources of information. This section organizes that information around the Personal Information categories set out in the CCPA. In the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of information:</p>
    <ul role="list"><li><p>Identifiers, such as name, email address, mailing address, and phone number;</p></li><li><p>Commercial Information, such as transaction data related to your use of the Service;</p></li><li><p>Service-Generated Data and Device Information, such as information generated from your use of the Site and Service and information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Site or Service;</p></li><li><p>Professional and employment-related information, such as employment and business contact information including job positions and titles;</p></li><li><p>Support Data, which may include information about your account preferences or data you provide when you contact us for help, contact or authentication data, and the content of chats and other communications with us;</p></li><li><p>Other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you; and</p></li><li><p>Inferences drawn from any of the above categories.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Sources of Information.</strong>&nbsp;We collect the categories of Personal Information identified above from the following sources: (A) directly from you; (B) through your use of our Services; (C) affiliates; and (D) other parties such as Customers, data brokers, other users, and social networks.</p><p><strong>Business Purposes.&nbsp;</strong>Everlaw uses and discloses the categories of Personal Information described above for the following business and commercial purposes:</p>
    <ul role="list"><li><p>Providing, updating, maintaining, and protecting our Services;</p></li><li><p>Communicating to you and responding to your requests, comments, and questions;</p></li><li><p>Providing customer and technical support;</p></li><li><p>Transactional and administrative matters;</p></li><li><p>Complying with legal obligations;</p></li><li><p>Protecting our rights, detecting, preventing, and responding to potential fraud and otherwise take action in response to misuse of the Site or Service;</p></li><li><p>Sending Service-related emails and other communications;</p></li><li><p>Sending marketing-related emails and other communications;</p></li><li><p>Displaying digital advertising to you;</p></li><li><p>Developing and improving our Marketing Activities;</p></li><li><p>Improving our Site and Service and developing new products and services; and</p></li><li><p>For other purposes with your consent.</p></li></ul><p><strong>When We Disclose Personal Information.&nbsp;</strong>In the past 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information for the Business Purposes described above:</p>
    <ul role="list"><li><p>Identifiers;</p></li><li><p>Commercial information;</p></li><li><p>Internet activity information;</p></li><li><p>Professional and employment-related information;</p></li><li><p>Support Data; and</p></li><li><p>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Advertising Preferences.</strong>&nbsp;The CCPA also requires businesses that “share” Personal Information to provide an opt-out from such sharing. Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s Personal Information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites. We “share” information for these purposes to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services. Everlaw shares, and has shared in the past 12 months, the following categories of Personal Information for targeted advertising with:</p>
    <ul role="list"><li><p><strong>Marketing and Advertising Partners</strong></p>
    <ul role="list"><li><p>Identifiers;</p></li><li><p>Internet usage information;</p></li><li><p>Inferences drawn from the above information.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Cookies.</strong>&nbsp;Everlaw uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to disclose information with our service providers and third party partners for a variety of reasons, including to secure, provide, and improve our Site and Service.</p><p><strong>Right to Know and to Delete</strong>. California residents may have the right to request information about a business’s collection, use, disclosure, sharing, or sale of their Personal Information. You may be permitted to request that we:</p>
    <ul role="list"><li><p>Provide you the categories of Personal Information we have collected or disclosed about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, “selling,” or “sharing” your Personal Information; the categories of third parties to whom we disclose or “sell,” or with whom we “share,” Personal Information; and the categories of Personal Information we “sell.”</p></li><li><p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</p></li><li><p>Delete certain information we have about you.</p></li><li><p>Correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.</p></li></ul><p>You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.</p><p>If you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@everlaw.com">privacy@everlaw.com</a>&nbsp;or +1.844.383.7529 . California residents can use “authorized agents” to make requests to know and requests for deletion. We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf.</p><p><strong>Sale of Personal Information and the Right to Opt-out</strong>. We may disclose Personal Information with third parties or allow them to collect Personal Information from our Site or Service if those third parties are authorized service providers or business partners who have agreed to our contractual limitations as to their retention, use, and disclosure of such Personal Information or if you use our Service to interact with third parties or direct us to disclose your Personal Information to third parties. As described under our Cookie Notice, we may disclose or otherwise make available certain Device Information with third parties in order to understand how you interact with our Site. Such information sharing may be considered a “sale” / “sharing” under California law. If you are a California resident, you can opt-out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information by submitting a request at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@everlaw.com">privacy@everlaw.com</a>&nbsp;or, in certain states, including California, by broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC) on the browsers and/or browser extensions that support such a signal. Any opt-out preferences you have exercised through these methods will only apply to the specific device/browser on which you made them. Your request to opt-out of sale/sharing will be linked to your browser identifier only and not linked to any account information because the connection between your browser and the account is not known to us. If you would like us to make the connection between your browser and your customer account when you send the opt-out of sale/sharing of your Personal Information request or GPC signal, and you have not yet opted-out of sale or sharing your Personal Information, we recommend you submit your Do Not Sell or Share Personal Information request at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@everlaw.com">privacy@everlaw.com</a>. We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.</p><p><strong>Sensitive Personal Information.</strong>&nbsp;If we process sensitive Personal Information collected about you, we do so for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul role="list"><li><p>Maintain the quality and safety of our Services;</p></li><li><p>Provide and improve our Services;</p></li><li><p>Detect any potential security incidents; and</p></li><li><p>Maintain customers’ accounts and provide customer service. </p></li></ul><p>We may also process this sensitive Personal Information as needed to help ensure people’s physical safety and as required by applicable law. We do not use or disclose sensitive Personal Information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt-out under the CCPA.</p><p><strong>Retention of Your Personal Information.&nbsp;</strong>Please see the&nbsp;<a href="#how-long-we-keep-information">How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</a>&nbsp;section above.</p><p><strong>California Do Not Track :</strong>&nbsp;We do not respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations, and solutions. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the Global Privacy Control browser choice referenced above.</p>
