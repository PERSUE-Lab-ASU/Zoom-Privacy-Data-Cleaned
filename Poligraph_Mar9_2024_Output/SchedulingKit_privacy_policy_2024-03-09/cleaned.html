All of the text, data, information, software, graphics, photographs and more that we and our affiliates may make available to you, plus our websites and any services, plug-ins, software, or applications (including any SchedulingKit applications) that we may provide all together constitute the SchedulingKit “Website.” SchedulingKit “Users” are the people who have created a SchedulingKit account, and “SchedulingKit Invitees” are people who have scheduled a meeting with a SchedulingKit User but may or may not have registered with SchedulingKit.

<h2><b>Information We Collect.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Website. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Website. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date, and time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SchedulingKit is not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will promptly delete such Personal Information from our systems.</span></p>

<h2><b>Calendar Information.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A SchedulingKit User may connect their calendar with SchedulingKit. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when you’re busy. We never store who you are meeting with, their email address, the meeting title, or any other details about the appointments in your connected calendar.</span></p>

<h2><b>Information Collected Automatically.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many websites, we and our Service Providers use Cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device subject to your opt-out preferences (see Your Rights and Choices section below). Using these technologies helps us customise your experience with our Website, improve your experience, and tailor marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</span></p>
<h2><b>Log &amp; Device data.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use SchedulingKit, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website. This log data may include the web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone or location. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</span></p>
<h2><b>Cookie data.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on how you’re accessing our services and subject to your opt-out preferences, we may use “Cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our Website, unique to your SchedulingKit account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use Cookies, we may use ‘session’ Cookies (that last until you close your browser) or ‘persistent’ Cookies (that last until you or your browser deletes them). For example, we may use Cookies to keep you logged into SchedulingKit. Some of the Cookies we use are associated with your SchedulingKit account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other Cookies are not. SchedulingKit provides a centralized cookie management service across the entire SchedulingKit application. You can find the link to manage your cookie preferences at the bottom of the SchedulingKit homepage.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Third Party Tools.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subject to your opt-out preferences (see ‘Your Rights and Choices’ below), we use third-party Service Providers such as Google Analytics to provide certain analytics and Viewer interactions services to SchedulingKit in connection with our operation of our Website, including the collection and tracking of certain data and information regarding the characteristics and activities of visitors to SchedulingKit. You may opt-out of relevant cookies using opt-out features on their respective websites.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><b>Sharing Personal Information.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose your Personal Information to a third-party for a business purpose.

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</span></li>

<h2><b>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights.</b></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable California Resident request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The request must:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide sufficiently detailed information to allow SchedulingKit to reasonably verify that you are the person to whom the requested Personal Information pertains or their authorized representative.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SchedulingKit will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Response Timing and Format.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will attempt to respond to California Resident requests in as timely a fashion as possible. In the event of delays over 60 days, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable receipt of a California Resident’s request. The response we provide will explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before fulfilling your request.</span></p>						</div>
