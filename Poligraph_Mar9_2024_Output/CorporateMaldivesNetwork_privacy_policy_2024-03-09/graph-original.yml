    or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
  - When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
    we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example,
    because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
    will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
    processing until deletion is possible.
