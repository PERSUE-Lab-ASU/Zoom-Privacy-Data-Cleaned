Following such requests, the Company deletes the data that it is not required to retain for purposes of regulatory, tax, insurance, litigation, or other legal requirements. For example, the Company retains location, device, and usage data for these purposes for a minimum of 7 years; while it retains such data, it may also use it for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention and detection, and research and development. In certain circumstances, the Company may be unable to delete a User\u2019s account, such as if there\u2019s an outstanding credit on the account or an unresolved claim or dispute. Upon resolution of the issue preventing deletion, the Company will delete the account as described above.</p>\n<p>The Company may also retain certain information indefinitely, if necessary, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention. For example, if the Company deactivates a User\u2019s account because of unsafe behavior or security incidents, the Company may retain certain information about that account to prevent that user from opening a new account in the future.</p>\n<p><b>Data Usage and Processing</b></p>\n<p>We collect and use personal data only where we have one or more lawful grounds for doing so.
