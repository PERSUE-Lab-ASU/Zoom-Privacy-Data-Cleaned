                <p>You may electronically submit data or information to the Services for hosting and processing purposes (“Customer Data”). ANALEC will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in ANALEC's Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. In accordance with ANALEC’s Terms of Service, ANALEC may access Customer Data only for the purpose described in our Terms of Use or as may be required by law.</p>


                <h4 class="textBlue mt-5 fw-medium">7. How we store and secure the information we collect</h4>
                <div class="ps-5">
                    <h5 class=" text-dark">Data Security</h5>
                    <p>At ANALEC, your data privacy and security are of prime importance to us. ANALEC maintains strict administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers. We use industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology to safeguard the account registration process and sign-up information and traffic from and to the server and browser while using the InsightsCRM Services. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption both in transit and at rest within ANALEC’s servers and at a broader cloud datacenter level, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files. This is maintained by our Cloud Service Provider - Amazon Web Services - and is audited through SOC compliance. A complete list of security at the cloud provider level is available at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/soc-faqs/" target="_blank">SOC Compliance - Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information and data you store in your account. Access to your name and email address is restricted to the employees of ANALEC. Data stored in your account is only accessed by the ANALEC team when performing the migration, or support services. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via TLS technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. Before, during and after a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) are not stored on our servers, but only with the Payment gateway in accordance with your personal settings. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is safe from intrusion by others. If you use our Services or websites, responsibility for securing your credentials to access the Services rests with you and not ANALEC. If you have any concerns regarding the security of your data, please write to us at <a href="mailto:legal@insightscrm.com">legal@insightscrm.com</a> with any questions.</p>


                    <h5 class="text-dark">Data Retention</h5>
                    <p>Unless otherwise required by law, we only retain the User and Client Data for as long as the User’s account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time in accordance with our Terms of Use for as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:</p>
