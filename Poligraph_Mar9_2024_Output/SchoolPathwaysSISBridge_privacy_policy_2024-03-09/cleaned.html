<p><strong>6.4 Annual Enrollment Review.</strong> Customer’s student enrollment shall be reviewed by School Pathways within 60 days of the start of each and new annual subscription period and the annual fees for that period shall be calculated by multiplying the then-current Product subscription fees by Customer’s student enrollment count.</p>

<p><strong>6.6</strong> <strong>Rest API Pricing. </strong>School Pathway’s REST API pricing covers up to 350,000 queries, or calls, to the REST APIs per month.&nbsp; Additional REST API calls made through Customer’s interface to the REST API shall be charged at a rate of one dollar (USD $1.00) per thousand (1,000) calls per month.</p>
