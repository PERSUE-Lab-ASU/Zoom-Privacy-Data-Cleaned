However, there are some service differences when users create an account and provide the necessary Personal Information to do so.</p><p>Although much Media and parts of the Services may be used and accessed without providing your Personal Information, other Media, portions of Media, and parts of the Services require users to create and log in to a Wistia account. In doing so, you will provide us with a user name or e-mail address and a password. In return we will permit access to Media and Services that are not viewable or accessible to anonymous users. By creating and logging into an account, you will provide your name and contact information, in addition to your username or email and password combination. Per the terms of this Privacy Policy, you will also permit Wistia to automatically collect, use, and share IP addresses, browser information, device information, and information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services. Wistia will also collect, use, and share any information you voluntarily provide in your communications to us, your user profile, and other user-generated submissions and content, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Consistent with the CCPA, this service difference represents Wistia\u2019s good-faith calculation of how one individual\u2019s Personal Information increases the value of the data we provide to Customers, on average. We calculate this value in conjunction with Customers by comparing the utility of the data collected anonymously against the utility of the Personal Information collected from identified users. </p><p>Once you have opted in to this incentive program by creating an account, you may opt-out of this incentive program at any time by deleting your account and/or contacting us:</p><p>Visit our Privacy &amp; Data Requests page at <a href=\"file:///about/data-request\">https://wistia.com/data-request</a> or by contact us at:</p><p>Attention: Data Protection Office\\\nWistia, Inc.\\\n120 Brookline Street\\\nCambridge, Massachusetts, 02139 USA\\\n(888) 494\u20137842\\\n<a href=\"mailto:privacy@wistia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">privacy@wistia.com</a></p><p>In light of the value Wistia derives from your Personal Information, if, after creating a Wistia account, you exercise your right to request that Wistia delete your Personal Information or to opt out of the sale of your Personal Information, you will not be able to access some Media and parts of the Services, as described above, because we will not be able to provide that Personal Information to our Customers.

Please see Section VIII for an explanation of Wistia\u2019s service differences.VIII. What Are Wistia\u2019s Service Differences?Wistia does not offer any financial incentives for providing your Personal Information. However, there are some service differences when users create an account and provide the necessary Personal Information to do so.Although much Media and parts of the Services may be used and accessed without providing your Personal Information, other Media, portions of Media, and parts of the Services require users to create and log in to a Wistia account. In doing so, you will provide us with a user name or e-mail address and a password. In return we will permit access to Media and Services that are not viewable or accessible to anonymous users. By creating and logging into an account, you will provide your name and contact information, in addition to your username or email and password combination. Per the terms of this Privacy Policy, you will also permit Wistia to automatically collect, use, and share IP addresses, browser information, device information, and information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services. Wistia will also collect, use, and share any information you voluntarily provide in your communications to us, your user profile, and other user-generated submissions and content, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.Consistent with the CCPA, this service difference represents Wistia\u2019s good-faith calculation of how one individual\u2019s Personal Information increases the value of the data we provide to Customers, on average. We calculate this value in conjunction with Customers by comparing the utility of the data collected anonymously against the utility of the Personal Information collected from identified users. Once you have opted in to this incentive program by creating an account, you may opt-out of this incentive program at any time by deleting your account and/or contacting us:Visit our Privacy & Data Requests page at https://wistia.com/data-request or by contact us at:Attention: Data Protection Office\\\nWistia, Inc.\\\n120 Brookline Street\\\nCambridge, Massachusetts, 02139 USA\\\n(888) 494\u20137842\\\nprivacy@wistia.comIn light of the value Wistia derives from your Personal Information, if, after creating a Wistia account, you exercise your right to request that Wistia delete your Personal Information or to opt out of the sale of your Personal Information, you will not be able to access some Media and parts of the Services, as described above, because we will not be able to provide that Personal Information to our Customers. However, other requests to exercise your data privacy rights that do not affect Wistia\u2019s ability to provide data to our Customers will not affect such access.IX.
