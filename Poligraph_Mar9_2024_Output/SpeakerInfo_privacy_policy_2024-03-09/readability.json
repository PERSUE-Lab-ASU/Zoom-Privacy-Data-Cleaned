Please review these documents carefully. &nbsp;\nWhere we process personal data on behalf of our business partners, &nbsp;\nwe will work with them to help them provide appropriate notice to you.<p><strong>2. Choice.</strong>&nbsp;\n We will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal &nbsp;\nInformation (or to provide explicit consent for Sensitive Personal &nbsp;\nInformation) being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than a &nbsp;\nservice provider as set forth below); or (ii) used for a purpose &nbsp;\nmaterially different from the purpose for which it was originally &nbsp;\ncollected (as set out in our Privacy Policy), or subsequently &nbsp;\nauthorized by you, when the circumstances arise. You also have the &nbsp;\nability to opt out at any time from the use of your personal &nbsp;\ninformation for direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right, &nbsp;\nplease check your settings options. Where we process personal data &nbsp;\non behalf of our business partners, we will work with them to &nbsp;\nensure you are offered appropriate choices (and means to exercise &nbsp;\nthose choices) for limiting use or disclosure of your personal data &nbsp;\n(where appropriate). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that &nbsp;\nwe may disclose Personal Information under the following &nbsp;\ncircumstances without offering you an opportunity to opt out of &nbsp;\nsuch disclosure: (i) to our partner institutions and other service &nbsp;\nproviders that we have retained to perform requested services on &nbsp;\nour behalf; (ii) if we are required to do so by law or legal &nbsp;\nprocess; (iii) pursuant to valid requests by law enforcement or &nbsp;\nother government authorities (which we are legally required to &nbsp;\nrespond to); and (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary to &nbsp;\nprevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an &nbsp;\ninvestigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. In addition, &nbsp;\nwe reserve the right to transfer Personal Information in the event &nbsp;\nwe sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets &nbsp;\n(including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or &nbsp;\nliquidation).
