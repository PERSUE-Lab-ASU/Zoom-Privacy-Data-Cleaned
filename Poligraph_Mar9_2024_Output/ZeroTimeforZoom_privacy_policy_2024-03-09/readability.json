Recording is a function of certain technology and cannot be turned off by individual Replicon employees or contractors for particular cases. Recording is carried out for the following purposes:\n                i. \tTo ensure accuracy of communication. This includes ensuring accuracy of our understanding of customer requirements, orders and agreements made with customers, and, if necessary, to accurately document such agreements in the event of a misunderstanding or dispute to protect both Replicon and the customer;\n               ii.\t To ensure quality of service provided by Replicon representatives;\n               iii.\tRecordings of telephone calls are initially not reviewed or overheard in any manner but are archived in digital format on a secure server without review. Such recordings may be subsequently reviewed by Replicon at any time for any one or more of the stated purposes and, in particular, may be used without notification or consent as evidence in the event of an investigation or legal proceeding related to such telephone conversation, or to review the quality of service provided in situations where Replicon has a basis to believe that such quality may not be adequate and generally only with respect to those Replicon representatives who interact with customers;\n               iv.\tCallers from outside Replicon are advised that their call may be recorded and potentially used on the foregoing basis. Callers have the option at their request of opting out of such recording by asking their Replicon representative to call them back on a cell phone, which is not subject to automated recording. Individuals may also communicate with Replicon via e-mail, fax or mail;\n               v.\tRecordings, including recordings that are not reviewed, are retained on the same basis as other Personal Information pursuant to this Policy. Where required or permitted by law, Replicon may use or disclose Personal Information contained in recordings. Replicon does not use information contained in recordings for marketing or solicitation purposes. Access to such recordings is restricted to particular individuals within Replicon who have obligations of confidentiality to Replicon and who have a need to review such recordings as part of their obligations to Replicon.\n            \n\n            d) \tCOMPUTER INTERACTION\n            i. \tThere are occasions where Replicon representatives may remotely access a computer of a Replicon customer in order to provide services, including technical support or product support. Such access may include an exchange of information of a conversational nature and, while not intended to do so, such access may result in the collection of Personal Information incidental to our providing services;\n                ii.\tThe activities carried out during such access are recorded and archived so that the recording of such activities may later be viewed or reviewed for the purposes of providing services to the customer in question. The recording is a video file and is subsequently used only for the purposes of assisting the customer;\n               iii. In all cases where a computer becomes subject to access by Replicon, such access will be with the customer\u2019s knowledge and consent.\n            \n\n            e)  OUR PLATFORM\n            i. \tThrough our Platform, we process Personal Information of employees and contractors of our customers for the purposes of providing our Services to their employer or party to which they are contracted.
