Customer can set its browser to notify customer before a cookie is received, giving an opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. Customer may also set its browser to turn off cookies; however, some Web sites may not then work properly.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;<b>Use of Web Beacon Technologies.</b>&nbsp;BarRaiser may also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor its Web site(s) to provide better customer service. If these technologies are in use, when a visitor accesses these pages of the Web site, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by BarRaiser or by its suppliers. Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If customer does not want cookie information to be associated with customer’s visits to these pages, customer can set its browser to turn off cookies; however, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;<b>Collection of Non-Identifiable Information.</b>&nbsp;BarRaiser may collect non-identifiable information from user visits to the BarRaiser Web site(s) in order to provide better customer service. Examples of such collecting include: traffic analysis, such as tracking of the domains from which users visit, or tracking numbers of visitors; measuring visitor activity on BarRaiser Website(s); Web site and system administration; user analysis; and business decision making. Such information is sometimes known as “clickstream data.” BarRaiser or its contractors may use this data to analyze trends and statistics.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;<b>Collection of Personal Information.</b>&nbsp;BarRaiser collects personal identifying information from customer during a transaction. BarRaiser may extract some personally identifying information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information, such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level (not at an individual level) to help BarRaiser understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level.</p>
<h2><b>6. Information Security</b></h2>
