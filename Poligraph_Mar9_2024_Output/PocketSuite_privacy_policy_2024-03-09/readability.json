The Company is sometimes referred to herein as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d and the business owner or the client (collectively the \u201cUser\u201d) (as defined below) is sometimes referred to as \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cyour,\u201d or \u201ccustomer.

We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>\n<p><b><em>Information You Provide.</em> </b>When you use the Services, you will provide information that could be Personal Data, such (a) your name, email address, mobile telephone number, password, date of birth, tax identification number, schedule, picture, and other registration information; (b) transaction-related information, such as when you book appointments with and send invoices to other Users or contacts; (c) information you provide us when you contact us for help; (d) credit card or banking information for making payments to and receiving payments from other Users or contacts; and (e) any other information you enter into the App.</p>\n<p><b><i>User Content.</i></b> The Services may include publicly accessible blogs, community forums, or private messaging features. The Services may also contain links and interactive features with various social media platforms (e.g., widgets). If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our Services or other services. You should be aware that Personal Data which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your information when interacting with a social media platform, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Data provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes.</p>\n<p><b><i>Financial Information.</i></b> We use Stripe, Inc. (\u201cStripe\u201d) to gather your Personal Data from financial institutions and process payments.&nbsp; By using our Services, you grant PocketSuite and Stripe the right, power and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution.&nbsp; You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored and processed by Stripe in accordance with the <a href=\"https://stripe.com/privacy\">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>.</p>\n<p><em><b>Information We Collect Automatically. </b></em>We automatically receive and record information from your use of the Services, including but not limited to: app usage, your IP address browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and cookie information. This information is used to optimize your user experience. Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of users of the Services. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.</p>\n<p><b><i>Cookies.</i></b> Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer\u2019s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer/mobile phone until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.&nbsp; We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services.</p>\n<p><b><i>Pixel Tags</i></b><b>.</b> Pixel Tags (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category may be based on Anonymous Data inferred from information provided to us by a user, may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We currently do not provide Personal Data to any ad networks for use outside of the Services. To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file pixel tag from an ad network to you through the Services. These pixel tags allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and pixel tags from the ad network\u2019s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>\n<p><b><i>Social Media Widgets.</i></b> Our Website includes social media features such as the Facebook \u201cLike\u201d button that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>\n<p><b><i>Mobile Services.</i></b> We may also collect Anonymous Data from your mobile device if you have downloaded our application(s). This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the Application(s), and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our Application(s) crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application(s). This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.</p>\n<p><b><i>Analytics.</i></b> We use third party analytics services, including but not limited to Google Analytics (\u201cAnalytics Services\u201d), to help analyze how users use our Site and Services. We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to improve our Site and Services. The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Site and Services (the \u201cAnalytics Information\u201d) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Service\u2019s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service\u2019s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Site and Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at privacy@pocketsuite.io.</p>\n<p><b><i>Third Party Data.</i></b> We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Services. These third party companies may supply us with Personal Data. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Services in order to improve the Services we provide.</p>\n</div><p><em><b>End Users\u2019 Personal Information. </b></em><span>Our customers who have created an account using PocketSuite are responsible for what they do with the personal information they collect, directly or through PocketSuite, about their End Users.&nbsp; This section is directed to such customers.</span></p><p><strong><em>a.

For example, during checkout you may ask your End Users to provide their name, address, email address and payment information so that you can complete their orders. You may also use cookies and similar technologies to analyze usage and other trends.</span></p><p><span>You\u2019re solely responsible for complying with any laws and regulations that apply to your collection and use of your End Users\u2019 information, including personal information you collect about them from us or using PocketSuite functionality.</span></p><p><span>We\u2019re not liable for your relationship with your End Users or how you collect and use personal information about them (even if you collect it from us or using PocketSuite functionality or cookies or similar technologies) and we won\u2019t provide you with any legal advice regarding such matters.</span></p><p><strong><em>b. End User Information That We May Collect.</em> </strong><span>We also obtain information about your customers on your behalf when you setup your account, import your client list, and/or they transact with you. We call this information Your Customers\u2019 Data. We collect Your Customers\u2019 Data when you setup your account, import your client list, and/or they transact with you through your use of PocketSuite\u2019s products, for instance when they make a payment at your establishment, or schedule an appointment, or receive an invoice from you. The particular Customer Data we collect will vary depending on how you use our products and services and which products and services you use. Your Customers\u2019 Data may include:</span></p><p><span><em><strong>Device Information.</strong> </em>Information about Your Customer\u2019s device, including hardware model, operating system and version, device name, unique device identifier, mobile network information, and information about the device\u2019s interaction with our Services.</span></p><p><span><em><strong>Financial Information.</strong></em> Bank account and payment card numbers.</span></p><p><span><em><strong>Identification Information.</strong> </em>Your Customers\u2019 name; email address; mailing address; phone number; or other contact and demographic information.</span></p><p><span><em><strong>Location Information.</strong></em> The location of Your Customer\u2019s device if they pay with Apple or Android Pay.</span></p><p><span><em><strong>Transaction Information.</strong> </em>When Your Customers use PocketSuite to make or record payments to you, we collect information about when and where the transactions occur, the names of the transacting parties, a description of the transactions which may include item-level data, the payment or transfer amounts, billing and shipping information, and the devices and payment methods used to complete the transactions.</span></p><p><span><em><strong>Use Information.</strong> </em>Information about how Your Customers transact with you using our Services, including access time, \u201clog-in\u201d and \u201clog-out\u201d information, browser type, IP address, the domain name of Your Customer\u2019s Internet service provider, other attributes about Your Customer\u2019s browser, mobile device and operating system, features Your Customer uses, and the date and time of use of the Services.</span></p><p><span>Other Information You or Your Customers Provide. Information that Your Customers voluntarily provides you, or that you input into PocketSuite\u2019s systems about your Customers. For example, survey responses; participation in contests, promotions, or other prospective marketing forms or devices; suggestions for improvements; notes you take about your customers, or any other actions performed when they transact with you using PocketSuite.</span></p><p><em><strong>Information Your Customers May Provide PocketSuite.</strong></em></p><p><span><strong><em>Identification Information.</em></strong> Your customers\u2019 name, email address, or telephone number, which we link to a tokenized version of their payment card number.</span></p><p><span>Privacy laws that apply in certain places, like California, treat \u201cbusinesses\u201d and \u201cservice providers\u201d differently. Under those laws, a business is the company that decides why and how to process personal information. A service provider processes personal information on behalf of a business in order to provide services. When PocketSuite processes Your Customers\u2019 Data, we generally act as your service provider. In select cases, however, we may act as a business when we process Your Customers\u2019 Data. For example, we act as a business when we use Your Customers\u2019 Data to send Your Customers digital receipts directly from PocketSuite, or when we allow you to use Customer Directory or PocketSuite Messaging to contact your customer using a dedicated business number that gets routed to them via PocketSuite.&nbsp;</span></p><div>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><b>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>While we consider the collection and processing of your information to be in our legitimate business interests we take your privacy rights seriously.

We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p><b><i>Aggregate Information</i></b><b>.</b> We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-Personal Data about you that they have independently developed or acquired.</p>\n<p><b><i>Interest-Based Advertising.</i></b> We may allow third-party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day).

These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites within their networks.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.</p>\n<p><b><i>Information We Share with Your Consent.</i></b> We will share your Personal Data with any relevant party you have granted us permission to share with.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><b>HOW WE STORE AND SECURE INFORMATION</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keeping your information secure is a top priority for us. To that end we comply with industry-standard best practices to secure your information. We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p>\n<p><em><b>Account Information</b>.</em> We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to accomplish the business purpose for which it was collected or to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, plus 1 year, and then securely disposes of that information.

Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p>\n<p><em><b>Information You Share on the Services.</b> </em>If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain.</p>\n<p><em><b>Marketing Information.</b></em> If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><b>HOW TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR INFORMATION</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can stop all collection of information by the App easily by uninstalling the App. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><b>ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT PRIVACY MATTERS</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b><i>Minimum Age. </i></b>The Services are not directed to individuals under 16.

For example, we limit access to your Personal Information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our App. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>\n<p><b><i>California Privacy Rights. </i></b>California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third-parties to whom we have disclosed their Personal Data (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of Personal Data disclosed to those parties.</p>\n<p><b><i>Links to Other Sites.</i></b> Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party\u2019s site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>\n<p><b><i>Changes to This Privacy Policy.</i></b> We will notify you when we change this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your Personal Data, or to the Privacy Policy, we will provide notice to you on the Services or by some other means, such as email or an in-app notice.

We automatically receive and record information from your use of the Services, including but not limited to: app usage, your IP address browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and cookie information. This information is used to optimize your user experience. Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of users of the Services. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.\nCookies. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer\u2019s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer/mobile phone until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.\u00a0 We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services.\nPixel Tags. Pixel Tags (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category may be based on Anonymous Data inferred from information provided to us by a user, may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We currently do not provide Personal Data to any ad networks for use outside of the Services. To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file pixel tag from an ad network to you through the Services. These pixel tags allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and pixel tags from the ad network\u2019s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.\nSocial Media Widgets. Our Website includes social media features such as the Facebook \u201cLike\u201d button that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.\nMobile Services. We may also collect Anonymous Data from your mobile device if you have downloaded our application(s). This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the Application(s), and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our Application(s) crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application(s). This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.\nAnalytics. We use third party analytics services, including but not limited to Google Analytics (\u201cAnalytics Services\u201d), to help analyze how users use our Site and Services. We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to improve our Site and Services. The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Site and Services (the \u201cAnalytics Information\u201d) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Service\u2019s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service\u2019s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Site and Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at privacy@pocketsuite.io.\nThird Party Data. We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Services. These third party companies may supply us with Personal Data. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Services in order to improve the Services we provide.\nEnd Users\u2019 Personal Information. Our customers who have created an account using PocketSuite are responsible for what they do with the personal information they collect, directly or through PocketSuite, about their End Users.\u00a0 This section is directed to such customers.a.

End User Information That We May Collect. We also obtain information about your customers on your behalf when you setup your account, import your client list, and/or they transact with you.

Under those laws, a business is the company that decides why and how to process personal information. A service provider processes personal information on behalf of a business in order to provide services. When PocketSuite processes Your Customers\u2019 Data, we generally act as your service provider. In select cases, however, we may act as a business when we process Your Customers\u2019 Data. For example, we act as a business when we use Your Customers\u2019 Data to send Your Customers digital receipts directly from PocketSuite, or when we allow you to use Customer Directory or PocketSuite Messaging to contact your customer using a dedicated business number that gets routed to them via PocketSuite.\u00a0\n\nHOW WE USE THE INFORMATION\n\nWhile we consider the collection and processing of your information to be in our legitimate business interests we take your privacy rights seriously. We use information about you for a number of purposes. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.\nTo Provide the Services and Personalize Your Experience.

We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.\nAggregate Information. We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them.

We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected Personal Data (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as \u201cinterest-based advertising\u201d or \u201conline behavioral advertising.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.\nInformation Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.

To that end we comply with industry-standard best practices to secure your information. We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.\nAccount Information. We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to accomplish the business purpose for which it was collected or to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, plus 1 year, and then securely disposes of that information. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.\nInformation You Share on the Services. If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain.\nMarketing Information. If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information.

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personal Information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain and use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures. For example, we limit access to your Personal Information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our App. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.\nCalifornia Privacy Rights. California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third-parties to whom we have disclosed their Personal Data (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of Personal Data disclosed to those parties.\nLinks to Other Sites.
