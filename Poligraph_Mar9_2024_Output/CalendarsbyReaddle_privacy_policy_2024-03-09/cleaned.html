<p>We use your personal data on the basis of the performance of the contract to provide services and communicate with the Users.</p>
<p>We share your data with the service providers (please, request Annex A. List of the processors to look through the list of service providers) and contractors to the extent necessary to provide services, technical and customer support, who, for example, help us:</p>
<ul>
  <li>operate, develop, and improve the features and functionality of our Website;</li>

  <li>complete your payment transactions;</li>
  <li>fulfill your support requests;</li>

</ul>
<p>In addition, we have implemented organizational and technical measures to ensure the security of personal data during data transfer to third-party.</p>
<p>We can share your data on the following grounds: consent, compliance with the law, and performance of a contract.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p><strong>Performance of a contract</strong>. We may transfer your data to our contractors and partners for contractual purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong>. We may transfer your personal data based on your explicit consent.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with the law</strong>. We may disclose your personal data to third parties to the extent that it is necessary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to comply with a government request, court order, or applicable law;</li>
  <li>to prevent unlawful use of our Website or policies;</li>
  <li>to protect against claims of third parties;</li>
  <li>to help prevent or investigate fraud.</li>

<p>The personal data we collect is stored on servers in the USA. The data is stored in the USA by default, but we may need to process your personal data in another country. We also share some data with our service providers in Ukraine.</p>
<p>There is no adequate decision by the European Commission regarding either the US or Ukraine. This means that the USA and Ukraine are not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data. We use adopted Standard Contractual Clauses based on legislation assessments for data protection during transfer and storage.</p>
<p>You can read more detailed measures to protect your personal data <a href="#securitymeasures">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, if a data transfer is required to perform a contract or provide you services, we have the right to do so without your consent.</p>
<h2 id="securitymeasures">Security Measures</h2>
<p>We systematically perform Data Protection Impact Assessments to ensure that we use an appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be more specific, to protect your personal data, we use HTTPS and encryption, divided group and individual access (where appropriate), an alarm system, corporate VPN, and written approved internal policies (like password policy and physical access policy).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, we systematically monitor our technologies’ state of the art and never forget about the backups. All our contractors are under contractual obligations compliant with the GDPR requirements. You can contact customer support in case of any questions regarding the security issues.</p>
