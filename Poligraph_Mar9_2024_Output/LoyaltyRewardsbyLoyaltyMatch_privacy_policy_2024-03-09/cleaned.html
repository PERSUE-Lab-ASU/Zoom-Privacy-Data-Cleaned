If we change our privacy practices, we may update this privacy policy. If any changes are significant, we will let you know (for example, through the LoyaltyMatch administration console or by email).</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">Our values</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Trust is the foundation of the LoyaltyMatch platform and includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information. Three main values guide us as we develop our products and services. These values should help you better understand how we think about your information and privacy.</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c9 c15"><span class="c0">Your information belongs to you</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c6">We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need. Where possible, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it. When building and improving our products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security teams to build with privacy in mind. In all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you, and we aim to only use your information to your benefit.</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_list_2-0"><li class="c9 c15"><span class="c0">We protect your information from others</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c6">If a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to share it unless you give us permission, or we are legally required. When we are legally required to share your personal information, we will tell you in advance, unless we are legally forbidden.</span></p>

	<ul class="c7 lst-kix_list_2-0"><li class="c9 c15"><span class="c0">We help customers meet their privacy obligations</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Many of the customers using LoyaltyMatch do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations. To do this, we try to build our products and services so they can easily be used in a privacy-friendly way. </span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c6"></span></p>

	<p class="c5"><span class="c8">Why we process your information</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the LoyaltyMatch application), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). European law calls these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include:</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c15 c16"><span class="c6">preventing risk and fraud</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c6">answering questions or providing other types of support</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c6">providing and improving our products and services</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c6">providing reporting and analytics</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c6">testing out features or additional services</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c6">assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c6">We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy—for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">Your rights over your information</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">We believe you should be able to access and control your personal information no matter where you live. Depending on how you use LoyaltyMatch, you may have the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, restrict, or object to certain uses of your personal information (for example, direct marketing). We will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information, we have to make sure that it is you before we can respond. In order to do so, we may ask to see documentation verifying your identity, which we will discard after verification.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">If you would like to designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights for you, please email us from the email address we have on file for you. If you email us from a different email address, we cannot determine if the request is coming from you and will not be able to accommodate your request. In your email, please include the name and email address of your authorized agent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">If you are not happy with our response to a request, you can contact us to resolve the issue. You also have the right to contact your local data protection or privacy authority at any time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Finally, because there is no common understanding about what a&nbsp;“Do Not Track”&nbsp;signal is supposed to mean, we don’t respond to those signals in any particular way.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">Where we send your information</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">We are a Canadian company, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world. To operate our business, we may send your personal information outside of your state, province, or country, including to the United States. This data may be subject to the laws of the countries where we send it. When we send your information across borders, we take steps to protect your information, and we try to only send your information to countries that have strong data protection laws. If you would like more information about where your information might be sent, please contact us.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Transfers outside of Europe and Switzerland</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">If you are in Europe or Switzerland, your personal information is controlled by, LoyaltyMatch Inc. Your information is then sent to other LoyaltyMatch locations and to service providers who may be located in other regions, including Canada (where we are based) and the United States. When we send your personal information outside of Europe, we do so in accordance with European law.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10">If you are in Europe or Switzerland, when we send your personal information to Canada it is protected under Canadian law, which the European Commission has found will adequately protect your information. If we then send this personal information outside of Canada (for example, when we send this information to our&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c18">Subprocessors</span><span class="c6">), this information is protected by contractual commitments that are comparable to those provided in&nbsp;Standard Contractual Clauses.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Finally, while we do what we can to protect your information, we may at times be legally required to disclose your personal information (for example, if we receive a valid court order). &nbsp;</span></p>

	<p class="c5"><span class="c8">Data Retention</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">How long we retain your Personal Data depends on the type of data and the purpose for which we process the data. We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</span></p>
	<p class="c5"><span class="c8">How we protect your information</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform. However, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.</span></p><p class="c5 c11"><span class="c8"></span></p>

	<p class="c5"><span class="c8">How you can reach us</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">If you would like to ask about, make a request relating to, or complain about how we process your personal information, you can contact us by email at privacy [at] LoyaltyMatch.com, or at one of the addresses below.
