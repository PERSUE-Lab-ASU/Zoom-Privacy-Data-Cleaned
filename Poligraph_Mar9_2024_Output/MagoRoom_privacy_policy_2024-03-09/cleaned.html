We may also receive information from other affiliated companies that are a part of our corporate group. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new prospects for marketing, and provide products and other services that may be of interest to you.<!-- --> </p><h4 class="my-2 block font-bold rem:text-[18px]">Location Information:</h4><p>We collect your location-based information for the purpose of providing and supporting our Services and for fraud prevention and security monitoring. If you wish to opt-out of the collection and use of your collection information, you may do so by turning it off on your device settings.</p><h4 class="my-2 block font-bold rem:text-[18px]">Device Information:</h4><p>When you use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier.</p></li><li class="pl-2"><h3 class="my-2 inline-block underline font-bold rem:text-[22px]">How We Use the Information We Collect and Receive</h3><p>We may access (which may include, with your consent, limited viewing or listening) and use the data we collect as necessary: (a) to provide and maintain the Services; (b) to address and respond to service, security, and customer support issues; (c) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, unlawful, or technical issues; (d) as required by law; (e) to fulfill our contracts; (f) to improve and enhance the Services; and (g) to provide analysis or valuable information back to you and other users.

With their express consent, we may also directly provide product and other Product-related information to attendees.<br>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p><p class="mt-2">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.</p></li><li class="pl-2"><h3 class="my-2 inline-block underline font-bold rem:text-[22px]">Your rights in relation to your information</h3><p>You have the right to:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-4"><li class="pl-2 marker:[content:unset]">Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li><li class="pl-2 marker:[content:unset]">Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li><li class="pl-2 marker:[content:unset]">Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li><li class="pl-2 marker:[content:unset]">Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li><li class="pl-2 marker:[content:unset]">Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:<ul class="list-disc pl-4"><li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li><li>Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</li><li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li><li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li></ul></li><li class="pl-2 marker:[content:unset]">Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li><li class="pl-2 marker:[content:unset]">Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li></ul><h4 class="my-2 block font-bold rem:text-[18px]">No fee usually required</h4><p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><h4 class="my-2 block font-bold rem:text-[18px]">What we may need from you</h4><p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><h4 class="my-2 block font-bold rem:text-[18px]">Time limit to respond</h4><p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p><h4 class="my-2 block font-bold rem:text-[18px]">If you fail to provide personal data</h4><p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p><p class="mt-2">If you wish to cancel your account; no longer require the use of our Services; or if we hold personal information about you and you want it to be removed from our database or inactivated, please use the relevant “Delete account” sections within the Services or contact us at the DPO Email address.<!-- --> </p></li><li class="pl-2"><h3 class="my-2 inline-block underline font-bold rem:text-[22px]">Analytics, Cookies and Other Web Site Technologies</h3><p>We are continuously improving our websites and Services through the use of various third-party web analytics tools, which help us understand how visitors use our websites, desktop tools, and mobile applications, what they like and dislike, and where they may have problems.
