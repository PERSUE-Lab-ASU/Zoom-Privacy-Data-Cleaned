We may also receive information about the pages you visit, the time you spend on them, the links or advertisements you see, click on and follow, the referring URL or the webpage that led you to our Sites, the search terms you enter, how often you open an application, and other similar information. Please see the section “Our Use of Cookies and other Tracking Mechanisms” below for more information on this.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Location, direction and journey information: this will be collected based on any connected device you may use our Services on. It includes your ZIP/postal code and street address, as well as the whereabouts of your device. Location Information is generated when your device communicates with cell towers, Wi-Fi routers or access points and/or with other technologies. Any connected device that you own, or which is otherwise linked to you will generate such information that will then be associated with you.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">We may collect the above personal data in the course of providing Services to you or to someone who has provided you with access to our Services. We may obtain this information in a number of ways, for example:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">directly from you: for example, when you make a purchase or provide your details in order to subscribe to our Services, submit a web enquiry or set up an account with us;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">automatically: when personal data is generated through your use of our Services or our Sites; and</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">from third party sources: we sometimes collect personal data about you from trusted third parties, in connection with Services that we provide to you or propose to provide to you, where appropriate and to the extent we have a justified basis to do so. These include fraud-prevention agencies, business directories, credit check reference/vetting agencies and connected network providers. Anyone who provides you with access to your Services may also provide us with your personal data in that context.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">We may combine the personal data that we receive from such other sources with personal data you give to us and with information we automatically collect about you, for example where we need to run a credit check, and then compile a profile of you based on the credit check data and the personal data you have provided.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">HOW DO WE USE THE PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT?</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">We set out below some of the ways in which we process personal data:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">to fulfil obligations under contract. This includes providing our Services to you; to communicate with you about your use of our Services; to obtain and process payment from you and to fulfil your orders for Services and any obligations on us relating to those services;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">for the purpose for which you specifically provided the information to us, including, to respond to your inquiries, to provide any information that you request, to address technical support tickets, and to provide customer service support;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">to make our Services and communications more relevant to you, including generating customer profiles, delivering customized content to you, to offer location customization, personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise tailor your experiences while using our Sites or our Services;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">to better understand how customers and other third parties access and use our Sites and Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">to administer, monitor, improve and customize our Sites and Services, for our internal operations, including troubleshooting, network management and network optimization, research and analytical purposes, so that we can provide our customers with a better customer experience;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, threats to our property or personnel and violations of our Terms of Service and/or applicable law and also to meet our legal and regulatory obligations;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">to notify you about our new product releases and service development, alerts, events, updates prices, terms, special offers and associated campaigns and promotions (including via newsletters). Therefore, we and selected third parties may use your personal data to send you marketing communications about products and services based on your preferences and interest. You have a choice and can object to our use of your personal data for marketing purposes. When we are required by law to do so, we will obtain your consent before using your personal data for marketing purposes. If you do opt out, we will stop sending you marketing communications, but we will continue sending you non-marketing communications that relate to the Services you are using (for example billing information, software/portal update communications, password resets etc);</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">if you attend an event, we may process information about you gathered in relation to the event and may share information about your attendance with your company. We may also permit designated event partner or conference sponsors to send you communications related to the event if you have shared your contact information at the event. Please note that sponsors from other companies may directly request information about you at their conference booths or presentations, and their use of your personal data that you provide to them will be subject to their privacy policies;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">to assist us in advertising our products and services in various mediums including, sending promotional emails, advertising our services on third party sites and social media platforms, direct mail, and by telemarketing;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">where we ask you for specific consent to a use of your personal data, we will use it in the ways we explain at the time of obtaining that consent; and</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">in any way required by law, regulation or the public interest such as in response to requests or orders by government or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation or to respond to an emergency. This use may require us to disclose your personal data including contact details and/or information about your usage of our Services to relevant authorities or to block, intercept or otherwise interfere with your use of our Services and any personal data generated by that usage. Achieving a balance between, on the one hand ensuring protections for the privacy and other fundamental human rights that may be exercised through use of our Services and, on the other, the exercise of lawful investigatory powers for the public good on the other can be complicated. We do not accede to such requests without careful consideration of all the circumstances. Even where we are legally obliged to disclose personal data, we will give careful consideration to the extent to which doing so will infringe on the fundamental rights, including the right to privacy, of any person whose personal data is to be disclosed or intercepted and we take whatever steps are practicable to mitigate and minimize any such infringement.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">WHAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE USES?</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">In the EU, our justification (sometimes referred to as “legitimate” or “lawful basis” legal basis) for processing any particular category of personal data will vary depending on the information itself, our relationship with the subject of the personal data, the Service being provided, the specific legal and regulatory requirements of the country in which the Services are being provided, the personal data processed and many other factors. Subject to modifications in specific countries, the legal bases for our processing are as follows:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">In order to communicate adequately with you as a user of our Services and to respond to your requests, we need to process information about you and therefore have a legitimate interest in processing this information to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our business;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">In order to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners, and to process purchases and effect installation of our products and deliver Services, we need to process information about you as necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">We process personal data for marketing and sales activities based on your consent, where it is required and so indicated on our sites or at the time your personal data is collected, or further to our legitimate interest to market and promote our products and services;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">We rely on our legitimate interests to process personal data and other information in order to analyze, develop, improve and optimize our Sites, products and Services, and to maintain the security and integrity of our Sites, network and systems. We also have a legitimate interest in using your personal data in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory and investigative purposes as necessary or because applicable laws (including telecommunications laws), regulations or the public interest require us to, such as to comply with legal processes, law enforcement or regulatory authorities or to assist in the prevention, detection or prosecution of crime or to process an opt-out request.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">We have carried out balancing tests for all the data processing we carry out on the basis of our legitimate interests and which we have described above. You can obtain information on any of our balancing tests by contacting us using the details set out in this Policy. In all other countries (except in the EU or in jurisdictions where similar EU type requirements exist), our justification for processing your personal data will be based on your consent and/or acceptance of the Terms of Service and this Policy. In all situations, where you withhold any personal data requested by us, we may not be able to provide you with certain Services or parts of Services or functionality.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">WHEN DO WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE THE PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT?</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Subject to obtaining your consent as may be required in some jurisdictions, we may share or disclose your personal data as necessary for the purposes described above and as further detailed below:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Corporate Affiliates. We may disclose the personal data we collect from you to our corporate affiliates. Where permitted by law and with your consent where required, our affiliates may use your information for the purposes indicated in this Policy, including to market their products and services to you. In processing your personal data, our affiliates follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Policy.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Business, Sales and Marketing Partners. We may offer some of our Services together with or through third parties who may be system integrators, resellers, solution partners, network partners and affinity organizations. If we do so, we will need to share your personal data with these third parties to assist in providing and marketing that Service to you, as well as to enable the third parties to market their own products and services to you (with your permission, if required). We may also share your personal data with companies that are system integrators, resellers, solution partners, network partners and affinity organizations, and whom we believe might offer products and services of interest to you (again with your permission, if required).</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Third-Party Service Providers. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions that are necessary for the provision of the Services or for any of the purposes described above. Examples include: where permitted, jointly offering a product or service, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks to give you access to our Services, fraud and financial crime prevention detection and prosecution, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), customer relationship management, providing training, these third parties include; system integrators, resellers, solution partners, network partners, affinity organizations, third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents, and other carriers or providers that we may disclose personal data to where necessary to provide our Services or fulfil your requests or orders, as well as entities that provide website hosting, service/order fulfilment, customer service, and credit card processing, effecting payments, among others. These third-party service providers have access to personal data needed to perform the functions we have entrusted to them but may not use it for other purposes where they process your personal data on our behalf. Whenever we share personal data with third parties, we take steps to ensure that third party contracts contain appropriate protections for your personal data.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Business Transfers. If we are acquired by or merge with another company, or if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company (which may occur as part of bankruptcy proceedings), we may transfer your personal data to the other company. We may also need to disclose your personal data before any such acquisition or merger, for example to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s adviser.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Legal Protection and in Response to Legal Process. We may disclose the personal data we you hold about in order to comply with applicable law, in response to or to pursue judicial proceedings, court orders and in other legal processes. We may also disclose, transfer or share it when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary: to protect or enforce our rights; protect your safety or the safety of others; investigate or prevent fraud; to respond to government requests – including from government and national or international law enforcement authorities outside of your country of residence – or for national security, public safety and/or law enforcement purposes. Personal data shall only be disclosed when we in good faith believe that we are obliged to do so in accordance with the law or that there are compelling reasons of public interest for us to do so. This will only be after a careful evaluation of all legal requirements and other relevant considerations, including any infringement on the fundamental rights to privacy or freedom of expression that might be impacted by the disclosure.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Sharing Aggregated and De-Identified Information. We may use your personal data to create aggregated and anonymized information which we may share with third parties. Nobody can identify you from that anonymized information. In other circumstances we may pseudonymize your personal data before sharing it with a third party so that we can re-associate you with the information once it has been processed and returned to us. Whilst the third party will not be able to identify you from the pseudonymized information, we will still be able to. We treat pseudonymized data as though it were personal data and ensure the same level of protection for it when sharing with third parties.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Personal data held by NTSCOM is stored on and processed on computers situated in the United States, United Kingdom, the EEA, and in other jurisdictions. NTSCOM and/or our service providers also process data in some other countries for customer care, account management and service provisioning.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">If you are an EEA resident, your personal data held by NTSCOM may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the EEA that may not be subject to equivalent data protection laws, including the United States. When you sign up for service with NTSCOM or inquire about our services, we transfer your information to the United States and other countries as necessary to perform our agreement with you or to respond to an inquiry you make. It may also be processed by staff situated outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Accordingly, by using our services, you authorize the transfer of your information to the United States, where we are based, and to other locations where we and/or our service providers operate, and to its (and their) storage and use as specified in this Privacy Policy and any applicable terms of service or other agreement between you and NTSCOM. In some cases, NTSCOM may seek specific consent for the use or transfer of your information overseas at the time of collection. If you do not consent, we may be unable to provide you with the services you requested. The United States and other countries where we operate may not have protections for personal information equivalent to those in your home country.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Subject to obtaining your consent as required in some jurisdictions, NTSCOM may transfer personal data across national borders in running our business and delivering the Services. In doing so, your personal data may be transferred to and processed by other NTSCOM entities and/or unrelated third parties outside of the country where you are located or where the personal data was collected.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">For relevant jurisdictions only (e.g. Mexico, Russia, China and Argentina): By using the Services, you expressly agree to the transfers of personal data to third countries where this requires your consent.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS</p>

Network advertisers select and display advertisements on third-party sites, based on your visits to our Sites as well as to other websites.

<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">SECURITY</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">At NTSCOM, security is our highest priority. We design and deliver our systems and Services with your security and privacy in mind. We maintain a wide variety of compliance programs and accreditations that validate our security controls. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal data we collect through our Sites and in the provision of our Services. We have put in place reasonable controls (including physical, technological and administrative measures) designed to help safeguard the personal data that we collect via the sites. No security measures are perfect, however, and so we cannot assure you that personal data that we collect will never be accessed or used in an unauthorized way, which may happen due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control. We have put in place procedures to deal with a suspected personal data breach, and we shall notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. If you have a user name and password to access our Services, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity or other security breach caused by you.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">WHAT RIGHTS DO I HAVE IN RELATION TO MY PERSONAL DATA?</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Under the law of many countries, you have certain rights in relation to your personal data that is held by us and we respect and observe these rights. Such rights may include the rights to: ask us to confirm that we are processing your personal data, ask us for a copy of your personal data (including information regarding who we share your personal data with); to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal data; to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data; and to ask us to share (port) your personal data to another person, such as another provider of telecommunications services.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">In addition, in certain countries you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing). Where applicable, you can also withdraw the consent you have given us to process your personal data and request information on the consequences of not providing such consent.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">These rights may be limited, for example: if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person; where it would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights); or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">To exercise any of these rights, to raise any concerns about our privacy practices, or to obtain other privacy related information, you can get in touch with us, see our contact details above.

<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">We have updated our Number Porting Policy – Last updated December 20, 2021. References to “Customer”, “You” or “Your” in this document shall include both the Customer and its end users.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">NTSCOM works with third party carriers who, on our behalf, ports telephone numbers in accordance with applicable Regulatory Rules and Industry Guidelines. Our third-party carriers and regulators require very specific and detailed information and requirements when completing a port request. Please be informed that You may be required to provide such detailed and specific information to complete a port request.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">If You are porting your number in from another carrier, please follow the instructions for Inbound Number Porting. If You would like to port your NTSCOM number out to another carrier, please follow the instructions for Outbound Number Porting.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Inbound Number Porting</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">IMPORTANT: YOU MUST KEEP YOUR PREVIOUS SERVICE ACTIVE IN ORDER TO PORT YOUR NUMBER TO NTSCOM.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Check to see if your number can be ported into NTSCOM by entering your number into our online verification system.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">NTSCOM’s online verification system will immediately conduct a validity search to verify portability. A validity search will determine if your telephone number can be ported into NTSCOM. Certain numbers are not supported by our regional calling network and/or certain providers will not port numbers, therefore, these numbers cannot be ported. If your number can be ported, You will receive a message on your computer screen that your number can be ported, and You will be immediately directed to fill out an online Letter of Authorization (“LOA”). If your number cannot be ported, NTSCOM will notify You on screen that your number cannot be ported.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Upon verification of portability, NTSCOM will notify You on-screen that your number can be ported. You must then submit an LOA to NTSCOM, authorizing your previous service provider to port your number to NTSCOM. You may submit an online LOA and submit your LOA in PDF format via email or fax to NTSCOM’s porting department as detailed on the LOA. Please be advised that if You do not fill out the information on the LOA properly, your porting request will be rejected. Most providers accept digital signatures on the LOA to port numbers; however, some providers require a handwritten signature on the LOA to port your number. If your previous provider requires a handwritten signature on the LOA, NTSCOM will notify You via email and request that You fax or email us a copy of your signed LOA.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Depending on the type of number You are trying to port in, NTSCOM may notify You via email that You are required to fax or email to NTSCOM a copy of your bill from your previous provider to verify your customer and account information.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">For Toll Free number porting requests, You must fax or email (i) a copy of your LOA with a handwritten signature and (ii) a copy of a billing statement from your previous provider. Local and business numbers. For local and business number porting requests, You may be required to provide a copy of your billing statement and/or a copy of your LOA with a handwritten signature.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">If You would like to ensure that your port is processed as quickly and efficiently as possible, You may also upload, fax or email to NTSCOM a copy of your CSR (customer service record). You may request a copy of your CSR from your previous provider. If You cannot obtain a CSR from your previous provider, You may request your previous provider to send a letter on company letterhead that lists your account number, billing telephone number, service location address and specific numbers You are porting.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">The following information must be listed on your bill, LOA or CSR to verify your customer and account information:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Number(s) You are asking to port Your Name Address – both billing and service addresses (if your address is a P.O. Box, please provide NTSCOM with an additional physical location address where the number resides) If there are additional numbers on your account with the previous provider other than the number to be ported, You must contact your previous provider’s porting department and tell them whether You intend to retire those numbers when canceling service.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">NTSCOM will then submit your LOA to your previous provider and wait for approval to port your number. You will be notified by NTSOCM via email if your previous provider requires additional information and/or corrections to your LOA before NTSCOM can port your number. When NTSCOM receives approval to port your number from your previous provider, we will begin porting your number.</p>

<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">(“Emergency Service Policy”)</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">We have updated our Emergency Service Policy – Last updated December 20, 2021.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Emergency Services calling operates differently with NTSCOM’s SIP/VoIP based VOICE CALLING SERVICES (“NTSCOM VOICE SERVICES”) than on traditional telephone services. It is important that you understand these differences and communicate them to all users with NTSCOM Voice Calling Plan Services. Customer acknowledges and agree that you have read and understand the differences in our Emergency Services calling and will provide this notice to each End User utilizing the NTSCOM Voice Calling Plan Services.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">REFERENCES TO “CUSTOMER” OR “YOU” OR “YOUR” IN THIS DOCUMENT SHALL INCLUDE BOTH CUSTOMER AND ITS END USERS.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">IMPORTANT EMERGENCY SERVICES CALLING LIMITATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS (ALL COUNTRIES):</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Non-Traditional Emergency Services Calling Acknowledgement. Customer acknowledges that NTSCOM’s emergency services calling is different in important ways from traditional landline and mobile/wireless emergency services dialing, depending upon where the Customer is located, the voice calling plan and the device(s) used with the NTSCOM Voice Services. The Customer affirmatively acknowledges that they have reviewed and accept the potential limitations arising from the delivery of Emergency Calling Services described herein when using the NTSCOM Voice Services.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Emergency Service Calling Availability Limitations. Customer acknowledges that the Emergency Services Calling may not be available in the following events:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Service Interruption. In the event of power, network, or Internet outages (including congestion), or if a service is disconnected or suspended due to non-payment, Customer may experience a failure, disruption or delay in contacting emergency services. NTSCOM recommends that Customer maintains an alternative phone service (such as a mobile phone) to ensure access to emergency services during any service interruption.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Power Failure or Disruption: Emergency dialing will not function in the event of a broadband, power, satellite or ISP Service failure or disruption. If there is an interruption in the power supply, a power surge or a power failure, the Voice Calling Service and emergency dialing will not function until power is restored. A power failure, power surge or power disruption may require Customer to reset or reconfigure equipment prior to using the Voice Calling Service or being able to make emergency calls.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Service Suspension or Termination by NTSCOM: A Service outage or suspension (including, without limitation, suspension of Service due to billing issues or delinquent or unpaid invoices) or termination of Service by NTSCOM will prevent ALL Service, including the ability to make emergency calls.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Other Service Outages: If there is a Service outage for ANY reason, such outage will prevent ALL Service, including the ability to make emergency calls.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Correctness of Information: Customer is responsible for providing, maintaining, and updating correct contact information (including name, address, location and telephone number) for the Customer accounts. If the Customer does not correctly identify the actual location where they are located, or if the Customer’s account information has recently changed or has otherwise not been updated, Emergency Service calls may be misdirected to an incorrect emergency response site.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">SIP/VoIP-Based Device and/or Unified Communications App Emergency Calls. If the Customer uses a SIP/VoIP based device and/or Unified Communications as a Service application on any device (“SIP/UC Device”), emergency calls will be routed to the local emergency center serving the emergency location that is associated with the SIP/UC Device. Therefore, if the Customer is using the SIP/UC device in a nomadic manner (e.g., from a hotel, from a home office, etc.), the Customer must update the emergency services location on an ongoing basis to ensure that emergency services calls will be sent to the appropriate local emergency center that serves the then current Customer location.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Customer Obligation to Inform Emergency Services of Accurate and Updated Physical Location: Since a Customer device can be moved between locations and for technical reasons the emergency operator may not have the Customer’s name, location or contact information available, Customer must immediately inform the emergency operator of the accurate location of where the call is being made, as well as the contact particulars any time a call is made to the emergency services operator, otherwise there is a risk that the emergency services may be sent to the wrong location.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Do Not Disconnect When Calling Emergency Services: When utilizing any Emergency Service, do not disconnect emergency services call until told to do so by an emergency dispatcher. If the call is inadvertently disconnected, call back immediately.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Customer Obligation to Inform All Users. Customer agrees to notify and inform all users or potential users, employees, guests and other third persons who may place calls using the NTSCOM Voice Services of the potential complications and limitations arising from the delivery of Emergency Calling Services described herein. If applicable, Customer agrees to place a label on and/or near each telephone or other Customer equipment/devices on which the NTSCOM Voice Services may be utilized regarding the limitations or unavailability of Emergency Services Calling.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">EMERGENCY SERVICE CONFIGURATION BY CUSTOMER ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATORS (ALL COUNTRIES):</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Registered Location Required: Upon creation of the Customer account, NTSCOM initially assigns all extensions and devices to the physical street address on file for the Customer. Prior to Service activation, the Customer Administrator shall: (i) register additional emergency services locations where the Unified Communications Services are to be used, as necessary; and (ii) assign all Customer devices to such emergency services locations. In some cases, one extension may have multiple devices, and each such device needs to be assigned an emergency services location. A Customer Administrator may register multiple emergency services locations per account and assign all active extensions and devices to such emergency services locations. Individual end users may assign and re-assign their current location(s) on an as-needed basis. The Customer agrees to ensure that the physical location(s) provided to NTSCOM are correct, and to immediately update such location(s) whenever the physical location(s) of the devices change. If a device will be used in a different or new location, a Customer Administrator must create and/or register the location for the device. If Customer does not register the new location, any emergency services call made from the device may be sent to an emergency center near the prior, registered location. In most cases, the registration process occurs in real-time. In some cases, the registration will be referred to an emergency services provider for validation, which could take days. Customer (i) acknowledges and understands that any location information passed to emergency personnel by NTSCOM will be based upon the physical location information provided by the Customer and (ii) agrees to promptly assist NTSCOM with validating an emergency services location address that has been rejected by the emergency services provider. The Customer will receive a confirmation email when the emergency services location has been validated for: (i) the initial registered location; and (ii) for any subsequent locations submitted by the Customer.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Failure to Designate and Update the Correct physical address when Changing Geographic Location. NTSCOM Calling Services are technically capable of being used in locations that are not associated with the traditional geographic area of a telephone number. These capabilities can cause problems with providing Emergency Service. All Emergency Service capabilities will only be available in the location that you have associated with the particular NUWAVE assigned direct-inward-dial (“DID”) telephone number assigned to the Customer. For any Emergency Service to be accurately routed to the appropriate emergency call center, the Customer must provide accurate DID telephone numbers as the call-back telephone number for all Emergency Service calls and accurate address information. Additionally, if Customer is using the service in a location that uses a different country and/or area code than the country and/or area code in the number Customer is using with the NUWAVE Voice Service, when Customer dials Emergency Services you may not be able to reach any emergency personnel. Even if you do reach emergency personnel, your call may not reach the emergency personnel near your actual physical location and the emergency personnel may not be able to transfer your call or respond to your emergency.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Failure to Designate and Update the Accurate Location When Customer Moves Phone/Device to a Location Different from the Location Initially Registered. It is important that you register accurate location information every time you move the equipment associated with your NTSCOM Voice Service. If you move your NTSCOM equipment to another location without reregistering, when you dial Emergency Services, you may not be able to reach any emergency personnel. Even if you do reach emergency personnel, if you have not provided valid location information you will not be calling the emergency personnel near your actual location and this emergency personnel may not be able to transfer your call or respond to your emergency.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Customer May Not Be Able to Reach the Correct Emergency Services If You Fail to Accurately Register or Reregister Your New Location or Call Emergency Services Within 48 Hours of Updating Your Location. It is important that you register an accurate location when you initiate your service and every time you move the equipment associated with your NTSCOM Voice Service. When you change your location, it may take up to 48 hours (or longer for Customers outside of the United States) for your location change to be reflected in our records. During that time, you may not be able to reach may not be able to reach the correct emergency services center or any emergency service provider by dialing your applicable local Emergency Services number.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">NTSCOM Calling Services Allow One Emergency Service Address to be Associated with Each Telephone Number. Certain NTSCOM Calling Services do not have a telephone number associated with them but allow for placing and receiving calls. For example, NTSCOM offers a “softphone client” service and/or Call Path Service (shared trunk VoIP Service). Customers may choose to buy calling services from NUWAVE that have a telephone number but then use the softphone client to allow multiple users to place and receive calls using one telephone number. Customers must use the softphone client and the NTSCOM Calling Service that has a telephone number associated with it from the same location. Using a service that does not have a telephone number in a remote location will result in the wrong address information being sent in the event of placing an emergency call by dialing the local Emergency Service number. The emergency call operator may not be able to transfer the call to appropriate emergency call operators. In the event that Customer intends to use NTSCOM Voice Services in multiple locations, at least one telephone number will be required for each location. You acknowledge and agree to this limitation and agree that you will obtain at least one telephone number for each location associated with the NTSCOM Calling Service.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Additional Emergency Call Service Requirements for Multi-Line Telephone Systems (United States): For Services provided in the United States, the Customer acknowledges and agrees to comply the following additional requirements:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Kari’s Law Compliance: Kari’s Law requires that all outbound dialing Multi-Line Telephone Systems (MLTS) must provide direct access to 911 service without the caller having to dial an initial number, digit, prefix or other access number before dialing 911. All Customers with enterprise phone systems are required to be configured as follows:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Enable dialing 911 directly without requiring a prefix or outside code;</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Notify an on-site party such as the receptionist or security manager when an emergency call is placed from within the organization; and</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Send a valid callback number that a 911 dispatcher can utilize to reconnect with the 911 caller. (Customer should not send the main number of its office as it could connect the dispatcher to a receptionist or auto attendant, instead of the 911 caller).</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Ray Baum Act Compliance (Dispatchable Location): Section 506 of the Ray Baum’s Act requires that all Multi-Line Telephone Systems (MLTS) Customers provide a “dispatchable location” on all emergency 911 calls. A dispatchable location is defined not only as the street address of the 911 calling party, but also must include additional information such as room number, floor number, or similar information necessary to adequately identify the location of the calling party. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer is responsible to ensure their Multi-Line Telephone Systems are up-to-date and compliant with the dispatchable location requirements of the Ray Baum Act.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Disclaimer of Liability. Customer acknowledges and agrees that NTSCOM, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, underlying local provider(s) or other public or private agencies and any third party providers will not be liable for any injury, death or damage to persons or property, arising directly or indirectly out of, or relating in any way to the Emergency Services, including without limitation any inability on the part of the Customer or an end user to access the Emergency Service, unless such claims or causes of action arose from NTSCOM’s gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Addendum, Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless NTSCOM, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, underlying local provider(s) or other public or private agencies and any third party providers from any liabilities, claims, damages, losses and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) which NTSCOM, its affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, underlying local provider(s) or other public or private agencies and any third party providers may incur, arising directly or indirectly out of or relating to the Emergency Services.</p>

This Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) governs the use of NTSCOM’s services, systems, networks, websites, software, hardware, and products (collectively, “Services”) by NTSCOM’s customers and its end users (collectively “Customer” or “You”). Upon any violation or reasonably suspected violation of this AUP, NTSCOM shall be entitled to immediately suspend provision of the Services in a manner reasonably tailored to address the potential harm. Customer shall immediately report any violations of this AUP to NTSCOM and cooperate with NTSCOM to investigate and remedy such violations. Customer shall not, and shall not authorize, encourage, assist, or enable any other party to engage in, any of the following in connection with the Services:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">General Prohibitions</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Violating applicable laws or regulations.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Using the Services in a manner that may expose NTSCOM or its suppliers to civil or criminal liability, or regulatory enforcement.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Customer may not sell, resell, sublicense, assign, license, or sublicense the Service or any component thereof or use or offer the same on a service-bureau or time-sharing basis, except where expressly permitted by NTSCOM.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Activities Impacting Security, Reliability or Normal Usage</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Damaging, interfering with, overburdening, or otherwise adversely impacting the availability, reliability, or stability of the Services or third-party systems or networks.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Attempting to circumvent or break any security mechanism of the Services, or using the Services in a manner that poses a security or other risk to NTSCOM, NTSCOM’s suppliers, any customer of the Services, or any third party.</p>

<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Unauthorized or excessive use of the Services beyond normal, reasonable business use and inconsistent with the types and levels of usage by typical customers on the same business calling plan. “Typical” refers to the calling patterns of at least 95% of NTSCOM’s business Customers on the same business calling plan. Certain calling and messaging plans, including unlimited calling and messaging plans, are designed for normal commercial use and are not intended to represent typical usage by unique organizations such as call centers (unless purchasing the NTSCOM specific contact center services), resellers, fax messaging services, telemarketing firms, or for use without live dialog, such as transcription services, intercom or monitoring services. Unauthorized or excessive use beyond that normally experienced by other NUWAVE customers may cause extreme network capacity and congestion issues and interfere with NTSCOM’s network and the third party networks with which NTSCOM connects for call initiation and completion services.</p>

For all calls terminating to the U.S., interstate or intrastate call jurisdiction shall be determined, on a per call basis, based on the originating and terminating information in the call stream data starting with JIP information then dialed number. Customer shall not route calls to NTSCOM that have been re-originated or that contain ANI masking or other systems or techniques designed to obscure callback information or the true original jurisdiction of the call. The origination location of each call will be determined using the NPANXX of the origination number determined from call stream. information in the following order: (i) originating Calling Party Charge Number, then (ii) originating Billing Telephone Number (BTN), then (iii) originating Calling Party Number ANI. The termination location of each outbound call will be determined from call stream information in the following order: (i) Terminating LRN, then (ii) Dialed Number. The termination location will be determined by the location of the NTSCOM or IXC switch to which the Customer’s service is connected. If a call originates and terminates in the same state, then the call will be an intrastate call, and the call shall be billed at the applicable intrastate rate. If a call originates in one state and terminates in a different state, then the call will be an interstate call, and the call shall be billed at the applicable interstate rate. If the origination location of a call cannot be determined, then NTSCOM will treat the call as being of “Indeterminate Jurisdiction,” and the jurisdiction of the call would default to interstate for the state associated with the designated termination location. Factors leading to “Indeterminate Jurisdiction” designations include, but are not limited to, the following: Blank ANI, Charged Number, and BTN, Unrecognizable Calling Party Number according to the LERG, ANI/Charged Number/BTN values beginning with any toll-free NPA including but not limited to 800, 855, 866, 877, or 888, ANI/ Charged Number/BTN values beginning with special NPAs, e.g. 911, 900, or 700, ANI/Charged Number/BTN value is an international number, i.e. a phone number outside of the U.S. Any of the above result in a rate charge of $0.015 per minute.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">4.2 Average Call Duration For Termination. Customer agrees to maintain at least thirty (30) seconds Average Call Duration (“ACD”) measured on a monthly basis for the aggregate of all Customer’s termination traffic. If Customer’s ACD is less than the required thirty (30) second duration threshold, then NTSCOM reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to bill Customer an additional surcharge of $0.0075 for each call below the required ACD threshold multiplied by the number of calls billed for that billing period. This surcharge is in addition to all applicable usage rates. Customer agrees to maintain a call connection rate of greater than 70% of attempted calls. If this threshold is not met, NTSCOM will have the option to adjust the minimum ACD.</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">4.3 Impermissible Traffic. NTSCOM will monitor Customer’s traffic to verify that no Impermissible Traffic is being terminated.

If within five (5) days after receiving notice thereof from NTSCOM, Customer continues to terminate Impermissible Traffic, then NTSCOM may suspend Services until such time as Customer has provided adequate assurances to NTSCOM that Impermissible Traffic will not be terminated. If adequate assurances are not provided to NTSCOM within thirty (30) days of the date of NUWAVE’s notice to Customer, then NTSCOM may terminate Service. If Service is resumed and subsequently NTSCOM determines that Impermissible Traffic is being terminated, NTSCOM may suspend or terminate Service upon twenty-four (24) hours prior written notice to Customer. Any suspension of service pursuant to this provision will not excuse Customer from its obligation to pay any outstanding bills for Services. Termination of Service by NTSCOM will be considered due to Customer’s breach of this Addendum. “Impermissible Traffic” consists of calls resulting from the following activities:</p>
<p class="preFlex" style="transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1); transition-duration: 0.8s;">Sequential dialing of telephone numbers at the NPA or NXX level;

NTSCOM and the NTSCOM Affiliate shall have no obligation to provide any Services until it receives such Supporting.  If a Service Order requires the delivery of Services in a jurisdiction where, in order for such Service Order to be enforceable, additional terms must be added, the Parties shall incorporate such additional terms in the Service Order (preserving to the fullest practicable extent this Agreement).</p>
