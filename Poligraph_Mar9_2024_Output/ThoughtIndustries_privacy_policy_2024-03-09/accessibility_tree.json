We may provide information and/or personal user content to service providers to help us provide the TI Service. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service, to send out email updates about TI Service, and to process payments for products or services offered by our Subscribers. In connection with these business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information and/or content for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. When you sign up for TI Service, we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service. We occasionally provide demonstrations of the TI Service to potential Subscribers. Any information provided in a demonstration is provided in a form which protects your information. We may be required to disclose your personal information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the TI Service. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. All such sharing of information by you on a Subscribers\u2019 Website is done at your own risk."}, {"role": "whitespace", "name": "\n"}, {"role": "whitespace", "name": "\n"}, {"role": "text leaf", "name": "We use your IP Address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.
