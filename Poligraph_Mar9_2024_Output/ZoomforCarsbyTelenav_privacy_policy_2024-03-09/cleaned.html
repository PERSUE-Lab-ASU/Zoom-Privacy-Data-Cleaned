If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access our services, products, or our website or engage in any of these activities.</p><p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Policy describes our approach to data protection, data privacy and data security, including our compliance with various governmental regulations and requirements, and explains why and how we may process your personal information where we are the data controller of that information. We also describe in this Policy your rights in relation to that information.</p><p>By "<strong>Personal Data</strong>", we refer to data that relates to you as an identified or identifiable natural person.

Some collected information is provided directly by you (e.g., when you create an account to access our services) and other information is indirectly collected through your use of our technology, access our websites and/or use of our products and services -- which include mapping, navigation, in car commerce and other services (collectively the "<strong>Telenav Platform</strong>").&nbsp;</p><p>The information collected through your interaction with and use of our Telenav Platform may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, demographic information, geographic or geo-location or routing information, information from your vehicle sensors, statistical and aggregated information ("<strong>Other Information</strong>"). We may collect and use your Personal Data to provide you with our products and services, to process your requests or as otherwise may be necessary to perform the contract between you and Telenav, to ensure the functionality and security of our products and services, to identify you, and to prevent and investigate fraud and other misuses.</p><p>We may also collect Personal Data and Other Information that you voluntarily provide. It is entirely your decision whether to provide the requested information, but certain features of our Telenav Platform may not be available if you elect not to provide the requested information (e.g., if you want to submit a request for support, but are unwilling to provide us with your name and email address).</p><p><strong>Navigation Services</strong></p><p>Each time you access the navigation services, your location, search and route information, including your point of origin or current location, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, your points of interest, favorites and other similar saved data, and the route you are instructed to follow are recorded and stored locally or in our cloud database. During an active navigation session, we periodically record your current location, data from your vehicle's sensors, and GPS heading and speed from the GPS hardware associated with your vehicle in order to provide you with your route or traffic flow data. Our navigation services also make use of your current location or route in order to respond to your requests for nearby points of interest (such as gas stations, restaurants, shopping, etc.). We maintain a database with these locations and route information and may use such information to improve our database, map coverage and to provide other features that may enhance your service capabilities, functions, and your user experience. We may share such location data in anonymized form with our third-party partners performing research and analysis about traffic conditions and road segment usage.</p><p><strong>Scout Mobile GPS Link (including Toyota &amp; Lexus Users)</strong></p><p>When your mobile device's location services are being used by Scout Mobile GPS Link or other third-party applications or your mobile operating systems services, the Scout Mobile GPS application may periodically collect and store data about your current location or route along with a non-personally identifiable version of your device ID. This location or route data may be used by us for anonymous traffic flow data or floating car data. For additional information about this data usage and how to opt-out, please refer to the "Contacting Telenav" section below.&nbsp;</p><p>When you choose to use your current GPS location for specifying the locale for a business finder search or obtaining a map within one of our mobile applications, we use your location or route information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. We anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis. Further, we anonymously record transactions for the purpose of paying directory listing and mapping data providers.</p><p><strong>Location Sharing (GPS Navigator, Scout Mobile GPS Link, Scout for Cars, Scout Marketplace, Scout Mobile, Partner-Branded Navigator Apps)</strong></p><p>Some versions of our Telenav GPS Navigator application, Scout mobile application, and our partnered-branded versions of our Navigator application include a location and information sharing feature that enables you to share your location or other information with another party. These location exchanges are transmitted within the Application or via the internet or text messages using SMS. For example, when you create, join, or navigate to a "Meet Up" with the Scout application, your name, profile photo, current location and/or ETA at the "Meet Up" location will be displayed on a map visible by other "Meet Up" participants. The "Meet Up" and your location and/or ETA will be removed from the map visible to other participants when you delete the "Meet Up". We record these location exchanges. Also, if you set up a "Notification" within the app, the phone numbers you provide will be automatically notified via SMS message each time you arrive at or depart from the location you select. You can turn off a "Notification" from within the Application's settings menu.</p><p><strong>Contact Sharing (Scout Mobile GPS Link/ Scout Mobile Application)</strong></p><p>In some versions of our Scout and Telenav navigation mobile applications, you can allow our Application to access the data stored in the address book and/or calendar on your mobile device. Our applications may use data from your address book or from your Facebook or Google+ contacts (if you signed in with a Facebook or Google+ sign-in) to allow you to search for and navigate to the addresses of your contacts, chat with your contacts within the Application, or create a "Meet Up" within the Application. Our applications may use calendar entry data to provide you with reminders about upcoming appointments and to provide navigation to the locations of your appointments. We will only access this data if you have given permissions for a particular Telenav application to do so, and you can revoke such permissions at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device.</p><p><strong>Ford Navigation and FordPass</strong></p><p>When you use Ford Navigation services in connected mode or the FordPass Application to search for a point of interest or an address, we receive and store your unique user ID assigned by Ford, your current GPS location and planned route and/or destination information, your address or point of interest search requests and search results selections, information about your use of the location and routing search service, its performance, and your related actions and selections. We may use this information to provide, improve, and enhance our products and services. It may also be shared with Ford in aggregated, anonymized format.</p><p><strong>GM Users of Navigation, OnStar® Connected Navigation and Connected Navigation</strong></p><p>Your most recent destinations will be saved to allow you to easily navigate to these destinations again.</p><p>When you choose to use your current location for specifying the locale for a business finder search, or obtaining a map, we use your location information for the requested purpose, and then discard it. For OnStar Connected Navigation users, we anonymously record any search activities and results for comparative analysis and product improvement.</p><p>For GM Navigation-only users, location and route information will be stored on your navigation system's local memory. For OnStar Connected Navigation and Connected Navigation users with an active subscription who have opted-in to use connectivity, location and route information in identifiable form will be stored in our secure cloud database, until your account is deleted, to allow us to understand what actions users are taking within a session and over time so as to improve our user interface, search results, ease of use, and accuracy and to develop other features that may enhance your user experience. For OnStar Connected Navigation and Connected Navigation users, your home and work addresses, favorite places, and recent destinations may also be stored with your account information in our secure cloud database until your account is deleted.</p><p>For OnStar Connected Navigation and Connected Navigation users who have enabled the predictive navigation functionality, we will regularly receive and record your location (latitude and longitude coordinates and road edges) from your vehicle's GPS hardware, whenever you are operating your vehicle. This data will be stored in our secured cloud database until your account is deleted and we will use such information to customize and improve your navigation and search experience and our services, for example to provide preferred brand point of interest search results, personalized routing, and commute alerts.</p><p><strong>BYD Navigation</strong></p><p>When you use the Telenav Software on BYD vehicles in connected mode to search for a point of interest, or an address, create a route, we receive and store (i) a unique hashed identifier assigned by BYD; (ii) your current GPS location and planned route and/or destination information,(iii) your address or point of interest search requests and search results selections; (iv) and information about your use of the location and routing search service, its performance and your related actions and selections. We use this information to provide the navigation and search services to you and may also use this information to provide, improve, and enhance our products and services. It may also be shared with BYD in aggregated, anonymized format. You may view this Privacy Notice within the BYD navigation system by visiting the "Vehicle Settings."</p><p><strong>Rivian Automotive LLC</strong></p><p>When you use the search feature on Rivian vehicles in connected mode to search for a point of interest or address, we receive and store (i) a unique hashed identifier assigned by Rivian; (ii) your current GPS location; (iii) your point of interest or address search request and search result selections; and (iv) information about your use of the search service, the performance of the search service, data usage, and OTA updates requested and delivered to your vehicle. We use this information to provide the search services to you and may also use this information to provide, improve, and enhance our products and services. It may also be shared with Rivian in aggregated, anonymized format. You may view this Privacy Notice within the Rivian navigation system by visiting the "Vehicle Settings."</p><p><strong>Intelligent Speed Assistance ("ISA")</strong></p><p>ISA is a vehicle safety feature that informs, warns, and discourages the driver from exceeding the statutory local speed limit, which recently became mandatory within Europe according to Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council.&nbsp;</p><p>If your vehicle is used in Europe, it is most likely equipped with ISA. In order to provide users with accurate digital speed limit data through our ISA service, we collect and process your current GPS location and encrypted device ID. This information is necessary for us to determine the speed limit of the road on which you are driving and to provide real-time notifications if you exceed the limit. Usually, such a system gives the driver feedback through a visual or audio signal, informing the driver of current speed limits and speeding. Please note that for the Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) feature, we may share data with the original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") of the vehicle. This is necessary for the proper functioning of the ISA feature, as the OEM may need to update the vehicle's software or hardware to support ISA. The data shared with the OEM may include GPS location and encrypted device ID information. Sometimes the ISA system may involve combining at least two technologies, i.e., combining GPS location speed data provided by Us with visual data extracted via cameras installed in the vehicle. As a standard, the collection of data from in-car cameras is usually not done by Us but by the OEM (directly or through other third parties), and the combination of the visual data with the location-based data is done directly by the OEM. More details in this respect can be found by consulting the OEM's Privacy Policy and Terms &amp; Conditions.

Telenav, as the provider of the car infotainment system, needs to share specific user data with Zoom to establish the necessary connections and enable communication between the two platforms. This data sharing is essential for the smooth operation of the Zoom application while driving, allowing you to join meetings, access meeting details, and participate in video conferences without interruption.</p><p>As the infrastructure provider of the video conferencing platform, Zoom may require certain user data to ensure the security and authentication of the Zoom meetings. This includes information such as your name, email address, and meeting ID, which are necessary to validate your identity and grant you access to the appropriate meetings. By sharing this data between Telenav and Zoom, both parties work together to deliver a reliable and integrated Zoom experience within the car infotainment system, allowing you to stay connected and productive while on the road.</p><p>Telenav processes user data, such as your name, meeting ID, email, and participant's names to facilitate seamless integration between the car infotainment system and the Zoom application. This integration ensures that you can access and utilize the features of Zoom conveniently while driving. By processing this data, Telenav establishes a connection between the two platforms, enabling the transfer of meeting information, participant details, and other relevant data. Telenav also aims to improve the user experience by optimizing the display of meeting information, providing intuitive controls, and enabling easy navigation within the Zoom interface. The goal is to make it more convenient and efficient for you to interact with the Zoom application while focusing on safe driving practices.</p><p>To facilitate logging into future Zoom calls, Telenav may locally store your meeting ID and participant login name within the car's infotainment system. This local storage ensures that you can quickly access and join your scheduled meetings without repeatedly entering your credentials. By securely storing this data locally, Telenav aims to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience when using the Zoom application on the go.</p><p>Overall, Telenav's data processing within its interfaces for the Zoom application is driven by the goal of improving integration, enhancing the user interface, and ensuring a convenient and user-friendly experience for Zoom users.</p><p><strong>Telematics (United States Only)</strong></p><p>Some Telenav products allow you to voluntarily "opt in" to the collection of telematics data from your wireless device and/or in-dash navigation or infotainment unit.

Telematics data is collected for the purpose of drawing insights and making predictions about driving patterns, safety, and the impact of external factors (such as weather) on accidents and driving events.

Having your carrier change the assigned phone number for your wireless device does not change the account number we maintain with regard to that device, which will result in your device not being able to access your Telenav account established using the previous phone number. If this happens, please contact Telenav Customer Support via email at <a href="mailto:support@telenav.com">support@telenav.com</a>.</p><h2 id="childrens-privacy"><strong>2 	CHILDREN'S PRIVACY&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We recognize that we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. Our services and products are not intended to be used by children. Therefore, we will not knowingly request or collect personal information from any child, or process such information, without prior verifiable parental or legal guardian consent. If, however, you authorize a child to use our Telenav Platform, including by providing them a device associated with your Telenav service, any Personal Data associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this Policy. Telenav encourages parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental or guardian consent. For the purpose of this Policy, a child means any individual who is under the age of 13 (or the minimum legal age to consent to the collection and processing of personal information where this is different under applicable law).&nbsp;</p><p>If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through the Telenav Platform. If you have reason to believe that we may have accidentally received information from an individual under age of 13, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:privacy@telenav.com">privacy@telenav.com</a> to have the information deleted from our records, except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="safeguarding-personal-data"><strong>3 	SAFEGUARDING PERSONAL DATA</strong></h2><p>Your privacy is important to us, and we maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. For instance, Telenav limits access to Telenav systems that store such information to authorized personnel. Telenav also uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to ensure transmissions of Personal Data are secured through encryption.&nbsp;</p><p>While Telenav maintains a multitude of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your Personal Data, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed. We recommend you protect yourself against any unauthorized access to your account by keeping your password and log in credentials confidential.&nbsp;</p><p>If required by law, we will notify you if it determines there were unauthorized acts that violate the law or this policy, or other security breaches.</p><h2 id="retention-of-personal-data"><strong>4 	RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></h2><p>We will retain your Personal Data for no longer than we believe is necessary for the purposes outlined in this Policy. The length of time we retain Personal Data, and criteria for determining that time, are dependent on the nature of the Personal Data and the purpose for which it was provided. For example, we retain your Personal Data related to managing your application account (such as name, email address, account content and preferences) for as long as they are retained by you within your account. We may typically maintain other data, such as records of your activity within the Application, only for a short period before anonymizing such data for further authorized use. We may also retain your Personal Data for other purposes permitted under applicable law, including, for example, defense of any legal claims. Additional information may be provided based on what is applicable to the product or service you are using. You may contact the <a href="mailto:privacy@telenav.com">privacy@telenav.com</a> to obtain additional information about retention of your Personal Data.</p><h2 id="sharing-of-personal-data"><strong>5 	SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>Telenav affiliates and authorized third parties</strong></p><p>We may share Personal Data with our affiliates, partners, vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy.

Therefore, we or our partners, vendors or agents may transfer your Personal Data across international borders outside the country where you use our Telenav Platform, including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that do not have laws providing specific protection for Personal Data or that have different legal rules on data protection, for example, the United States of America. In such cases we ensure that, prior to any transfer, there is a legal basis for such a transfer and that adequate protection for your Personal Data is provided as required by applicable law, for example, by using standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or relevant authorities (where necessary) and by requiring the use of other appropriate technical and organizational information security measures. You may contact the Telenav privacy team at <a href="mailto:privacy@telenav.com">privacy@telenav.com</a> to obtain additional information about the safeguards we take in connection with these transfers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mandatory disclosures</strong></p><p>We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.

Pour fournir aux utilisateurs des données numériques précises sur les limitations de vitesse par l'intermédiaire de notre service ISA, nous collectons et traitons votre position GPS actuelle et l'identifiant crypté de votre appareil. Ces informations sont nécessaires pour déterminer la limite de vitesse de la route sur laquelle vous conduisez et pour fournir des notifications en temps réel si vous dépassez la limite. En général, ce type de système informe le conducteur par un signal visuel ou sonore des limitations de vitesse en vigueur et des excès de vitesse. Veuillez noter que pour la fonction d'assistance intelligente à la vitesse (ISA), nous pouvons partager des données avec le fabricant de l'équipement d'origine ("OEM") du véhicule. Cela est nécessaire au bon fonctionnement de la fonction ISA, car l'équipementier peut avoir besoin de mettre à jour le logiciel ou le matériel du véhicule pour prendre en charge l'ISA. Les données partagées avec l'équipementier peuvent inclure la localisation GPS et des informations cryptées sur l'identification de l'appareil. Parfois, le système ISA peut impliquer la combinaison d'au moins deux technologies, c'est-à-dire la combinaison de données de vitesse de localisation GPS fournies par l'utilisateur avec des données visuelles extraites par des caméras installées dans le véhicule. En règle générale, la collecte des données provenant des caméras embarquées n'est pas effectuée par nous, mais par l'équipementier (directement ou par l'intermédiaire de tiers), et la combinaison des données visuelles avec les données de localisation est effectuée directement par l'équipementier. Pour plus de détails à ce sujet, il convient de consulter la politique de confidentialité et les conditions générales de l'équipementier. Ces documents peuvent fournir une explication plus détaillée du fonctionnement de l'ISA, ainsi que toute disposition spécifique relative à la collecte, à l'utilisation et au partage des informations liées à cette fonctionnalité.</p><p><strong>Accès aux services de cartographie et de données de Telenav par le biais d'applications tierces</strong></p><p>Quand vous accédez aux services de cartographie et de données Telenav par le biais d’une application tierce, nous recevons et stockons les renseignements sur votre emplacement et votre itinéraire provenant de votre appareil avec toute demande de recherche d'adresse ou de point d’intérêt ainsi que les renseignements connexes sur l’emplacement et l’itinéraire.
