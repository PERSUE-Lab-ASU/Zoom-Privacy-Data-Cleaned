In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Slack (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information, and/or a billing address. 2. Usage information: \u25aa Services metadata. When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way that an Authorized User uses the Services. For example, Slack logs the Workspaces, channels, people, features, content, and links you view or interact with, the types of files shared and what Third-Party Services are used (if any) \u25aa Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page you visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, and your language preferences. \u25aa Device information. Slack collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings. \u25aa Location information. We receive information from you, our Customers and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer (who is our Customer) or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location to assist with localization or for security purposes. 3. Cookie information: Slack uses a variety of cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services to help us collect Other Information. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out controls and other options, please visit our Cookie Policy. 4. Third-Party Services information: A Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services for its Workspace and Slack can receive personal data from such Third-Party Services. Typically, Third-Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for its Workspace (for more details on third-party application management, settings and permissions, click here). Slack may also develop and offer Slack applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party Service. Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share certain information with Slack. For example, if a cloud storage application you are using is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive the user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application makes available to Slack to facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Slack. When a Third-Party Service is enabled, Slack is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to Slack in accordance with our agreement with the provider of the Third-Party Service and any permission(s) granted by our Customer (including, by its Authorized User(s)). Examples of information which Slack may receive in this manner include whether you successfully created a new account or interacted with a third-party application in a way that is attributable to Slack usage activity. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Services. For more information on Slack\u2019s interaction with Third-Party Services, click here. 5. Contact information: In accordance with the consent process provided by your device or other third-party API, any contact information that an Authorized User chooses to import (such as importing an address book to find coworkers and Slack Connect contacts or calendar from a device or API), forward or upload to the Services (for example, when sending emails to the Services) is collected when using the Services. 6. Third-Party data: Slack may receive data about organizations, industries, lists of companies that are customers, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners, or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed. 7. Audio and video metadata: Slack may receive, capture, and store metadata derived from your use of features such as Slack Huddles or Clips, and additional related data such as data regarding the date and time of your Slack Huddle and the Authorized User that you connected with. 8. Additional information provided to Slack: We also receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or in other ways, such as responses or opinions you provide if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, feedback you provide about our products or services, information you provide if you apply for a job with Slack, enroll in a certification program or other educational program hosted by Slack or a vendor, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Slack.", "level": 1, "children": [{"role": "list item marker", "name": "\u2022 "}, {"role": "text leaf", "name": "Other Information."}, {"role": "text leaf", "name": " Slack also collects, generates and/or receives the following categories of Other Information:"}, {"role": "list", "name": "", "children": [{"role": "listitem", "name": "1.
