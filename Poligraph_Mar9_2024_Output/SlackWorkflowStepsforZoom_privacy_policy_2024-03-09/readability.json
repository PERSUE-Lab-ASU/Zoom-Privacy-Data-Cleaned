In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the \u201c<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>\u201d), including the processing of data such as messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, \u201c<strong>Customer Data</strong>\u201d). The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (\u201c<strong>Customer</strong>\u201d) controls its instance of the Services (its \u201c<strong>Workspace</strong>\u201d) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have an account, you can check <a href=\"file:///account/team\">http://slack.com/account/team</a> for the contact information of your Workspace owner(s) and administrator(s). If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.</p><p><em>California Notice of Collection of Personal Information: We collect the information described below under \u201cInformation We Collect and Receive\u201d for the business and commercial purposes described below under \u201cInformation Use.\u201d To learn more about exercising your California Privacy Rights please review the \u201cCalifornia Privacy Rights\u201d section below.</em></p><h2 id=\"collect\">Information We Collect And Receive</h2><p>Slack will collect and receive information through operating the Services and Websites, and through other interactions with Slack. Such information will include Customer Data and other information and data (\u201c<strong>Other Information</strong>\u201d) in a variety of ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Customer Data</strong>. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (\u201c<strong>Authorized Users</strong>\u201d) routinely submit Customer Data (such as messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts) to Slack when using the Services.</li><li><strong>Other Information.</strong> Slack also collects, generates and/or receives the following categories of Other Information:<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Workspace and account information</strong>: To create or update a Workspace account, you or our Customer (e.g. your employer) supply Slack with an email address, phone number, password, domain, and/or other account set up details (for more detail on Workspace creation, <a href=\"file:///help/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace\" data-no-clog=\"\">click here</a>. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Slack (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information, and/or a billing address.</li><li><strong>Usage information:</strong><ul><li><em>Services metadata</em>. When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way that an Authorized User uses the Services. For example, Slack logs the Workspaces, channels, people, features, content, and links you view or interact with, the types of files shared and what Third-Party Services are used (if any)</li><li><em>Log data</em>. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page you visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, and your language preferences.</li><li><em>Device information</em>. Slack collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.</li><li><em>Location information</em>. We receive information from you, our Customers and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer (who is our Customer) or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location to assist with localization or for security purposes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cookie information</strong>: Slack uses a variety of cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services to help us collect Other Information. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out controls and other options, please visit our <a href=\"https://slack.com/cookie-policy\" data-no-clog=\"\">Cookie Policy</a>.</li><li><strong>Third-Party Services information</strong>: A Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services for its Workspace and Slack can receive personal data from such Third-Party Services. Typically, Third-Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for its Workspace (for more details on third-party application management, settings and permissions, <a href=\"file:///help/articles/1500009181142-Manage-app-settings-and-permissions\" data-no-clog=\"\">click here</a>). Slack may also develop and offer Slack applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party Service. Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share certain information with Slack. For example, if a cloud storage application you are using is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive the user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application makes available to Slack to facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Slack. When a Third-Party Service is enabled, Slack is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to Slack in accordance with our agreement with the provider of the Third-Party Service and any permission(s) granted by our Customer (including, by its Authorized User(s)). Examples of information which Slack may receive in this manner include whether you successfully created a new account or interacted with a third-party application in a way that is attributable to Slack usage activity. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Services.

This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.</li><li><strong>Audio and video metadata</strong>: Slack may receive, capture, and store metadata derived from your use of features such as Slack Huddles or Clips, and additional related data such as data regarding the date and time of your Slack Huddle and the Authorized User that you connected with.</li><li><strong>Additional information provided to Slack</strong>: We also receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or in other ways, such as responses or opinions you provide if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, feedback you provide about our products or services, information you provide if you apply for a job with Slack, enroll in a certification program or other educational program hosted by Slack or a vendor, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Slack.</li></ol></li></ul><p>Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, \u201c<strong>Information</strong>\u201d). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.</p><h2 id=\"information\">How We Process Your Information and our Legal Bases for Doing So</h2><p>Customer Data will be used by Slack in accordance with a Customer\u2019s instructions, including to provide the Services, any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, a Customer\u2019s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. Slack is a processor of Customer Data and the Customer is the controller. Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to a Workspace, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share, and remove Customer Data, and otherwise apply its policies to the Services.</p><p>Slack uses Other Information to operate our Services, Websites, and business. More specifically, Slack uses Other Information for the following purposes:</p><p><u><strong>Compliance With A Legal Obligation:</strong></u> <br> Slack processes Other Information when we comply with a legal obligation including, for example, to access, preserve or disclose certain information if there is a valid legal request from a regulator, law enforcement or others.

Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of Information to third parties. Slack does not control how a Customer or any third party chooses to share or disclose Information.</p><ul><li><strong>The Customer\u2019s Instructions.</strong> Slack may share and disclose Information in accordance with a Customer\u2019s instructions and with appropriate consent, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and the Customer\u2019s use of Services functionality and in compliance with applicable law and legal process. Some sharing at a Customer\u2019s request may incur additional fees.<ul><li>To enable Slack to follow our Customers\u2019 instructions, Slack provides several <a href=\"file:///help/articles/115005594006-Guide-to-the-Enterprise-Grid-admin-dashboard\">administrator controls</a> to allow Customers to manage their Workspaces. For example, we follow our Customers\u2019 instructions to enable or disable Authorized Users use of various features of the Services, such as <a href=\"file:///help/articles/4406235165587-Record-audio-and-video-clips-in-Slack\">Clips</a> or <a href=\"file:///help/articles/4402059015315-Use-huddles-in-Slack\">Slack Huddles</a>, <a href=\"file:///help/articles/360004635551-Manage-channel-posting-permissions-\">channel posting permissions</a>, the sharing and visibility of direct messages including files, or whether and how Authorized Users can connect with other organizations\u2019 Workspaces through Slack Connect.</li><li>We also follow Customer and Authorized User instructions on how an Authorized User\u2019s profile may be displayed within a <a href=\"file:///help/articles/212281478-Customize-member-profiles\">Customer\u2019s Workspace</a> or when shared through <a href=\"file:///help/articles/4417558556691-Manage-profile-details-for-Slack-Connect\">Slack Connect</a> or other features.</li><li>Customers may also provide their Authorized Users with the ability to adjust the audience and visibility of certain Customer Data. To learn more, visit our <a href=\"file:///help\">Help Center</a> to understand what choices and settings are available. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Displaying the Services.</strong> When an Authorized User submits Information, it may be displayed or discoverable to other Authorized Users in the same or connected Workspaces or Slack Connect instances. For example, an Authorized User\u2019s email address may be displayed with their Workspace profile, or other profile and organizational information may be displayed to Authorized Users. Please consult the <a href=\"https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us\" data-no-clog=\"\">Help Center</a> for more information on Services functionality.</li><li><strong>Collaborating with Others.</strong> The Services provide different ways for Authorized Users working in independent Workspaces to collaborate, such as Slack Connect or email interoperability. Information, such as an Authorized User\u2019s profile and organizational information, may be shared, subject to the policies and practices of the Workspace(s) you use. For example, depending on the settings of your Workspace, to enable connections with other Authorized Users, your profile may be shared or searchable or discoverable by Authorized Users or other users outside of Workspace(s) you belong to, or shared via email when you invite an Authorized User or other user to collaborate via Slack Connect. In many instances, Slack includes either administrator controls or user controls, depending on the use case, with respect to external collaboration. Authorized Users may also decide to expand the visibility of certain content and Customer Data, such as files.</li><li><strong>Customer access.</strong> Owners, administrators, Authorized Users, and other Customer representatives and personnel may be able to access, modify, or restrict access to Information.

For example, Slack logs the Workspaces, channels, people, features, content, and links you view or interact with, the types of files shared and what Third-Party Services are used (if any)Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files.

Typically, Third-Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for its Workspace (for more details on third-party application management, settings and permissions, click here). Slack may also develop and offer Slack applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party Service. Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share certain information with Slack. For example, if a cloud storage application you are using is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive the user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application makes available to Slack to facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Slack. When a Third-Party Service is enabled, Slack is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to Slack in accordance with our agreement with the provider of the Third-Party Service and any permission(s) granted by our Customer (including, by its Authorized User(s)). Examples of information which Slack may receive in this manner include whether you successfully created a new account or interacted with a third-party application in a way that is attributable to Slack usage activity.

How We Share and Disclose InformationThis section describes how Slack may share and disclose Information, as described in the section entitled 'Information We Collect and Receive' above. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of Information to third parties. Slack does not control how a Customer or any third party chooses to share or disclose Information.The Customer\u2019s Instructions. Slack may share and disclose Information in accordance with a Customer\u2019s instructions and with appropriate consent, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and the Customer\u2019s use of Services functionality and in compliance with applicable law and legal process. Some sharing at a Customer\u2019s request may incur additional fees.To enable Slack to follow our Customers\u2019 instructions, Slack provides several administrator controls to allow Customers to manage their Workspaces. For example, we follow our Customers\u2019 instructions to enable or disable Authorized Users use of various features of the Services, such as Clips or Slack Huddles, channel posting permissions, the sharing and visibility of direct messages including files, or whether and how Authorized Users can connect with other organizations\u2019 Workspaces through Slack Connect.We also follow Customer and Authorized User instructions on how an Authorized User\u2019s profile may be displayed within a Customer\u2019s Workspace or when shared through Slack Connect or other features.Customers may also provide their Authorized Users with the ability to adjust the audience and visibility of certain Customer Data. To learn more, visit our Help Center to understand what choices and settings are available. Displaying the Services. When an Authorized User submits Information, it may be displayed or discoverable to other Authorized Users in the same or connected Workspaces or Slack Connect instances. For example, an Authorized User\u2019s email address may be displayed with their Workspace profile, or other profile and organizational information may be displayed to Authorized Users. Please consult the Help Center for more information on Services functionality.Collaborating with Others. The Services provide different ways for Authorized Users working in independent Workspaces to collaborate, such as Slack Connect or email interoperability. Information, such as an Authorized User\u2019s profile and organizational information, may be shared, subject to the policies and practices of the Workspace(s) you use. For example, depending on the settings of your Workspace, to enable connections with other Authorized Users, your profile may be shared or searchable or discoverable by Authorized Users or other users outside of Workspace(s) you belong to, or shared via email when you invite an Authorized User or other user to collaborate via Slack Connect. In many instances, Slack includes either administrator controls or user controls, depending on the use case, with respect to external collaboration. Authorized Users may also decide to expand the visibility of certain content and Customer Data, such as files.Customer access. Owners, administrators, Authorized Users, and other Customer representatives and personnel may be able to access, modify, or restrict access to Information. This may include, for example, your employer using features of the Services to access or modify your profile details, or to export logs of Workspace activity.
