<p><strong>13. Cookies</strong><br>
Cookies are text files stored in your browser. They are often encrypted. They are created when a user’s browser loads a particular website: the website sends information to the browser, which then creates a text file. Each time the user returns to the same website, the browser retrieves this file and sends it to the website’s server.<br>
The Solution uses different types of cookies, which have different purposes:<br>
• Technical cookies are used throughout your browsing experience to facilitate your navigation and to perform certain functions. A technical cookie may be used, for example, to store the answers given in a form or the user’s preferences for the language or layout of a website, where such options are available.<br>
These cookies are essential for the performance of the service.<br>
Among these technical cookies, several third-party cookies are used to offer functionalities based on services external to the Solution: for the login buttons placed on the homepage: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn; for access to customer support: Crisp; for the captcha on the registration page: FriendlyCAPTCHA.<br>
• Audience analysis cookies are used for statistical purposes and allow us to measure the number of visits to the Solution, the number of pages viewed and the use of the site’s features. Using this information base, we can further improve the product and your user experience on our website as we gain a better understanding of our users’ expectations. Your IP address is also collected to determine the city from which you are connecting.<br>
Among these audience analysis cookies, Beekast use Google Analytics third-party cookie.<br>
• Marketing cookies give us insight into how our customers use the Solution, so we can provide them with personalised support for their experience of the Solution and the way they use it. These cookies also allow us to adapt our communication policy to each customer.<br>
Among these marketing cookies are several third-party cookies: Zoho, LinkedIn, Facebook, Google Ads, Outbrain.<br>
Be advised that you can configure your browser to block cookies. However, doing so may prevent the Solution from working properly.</p>

Individuals whose data is collected on the basis of our legitimate interest, as mentioned in Article 4, are reminded that they may object to the processing of their data at any time. Nevertheless, we may continue to carry out processing if there are legitimate grounds for the processing which override your rights and freedoms or if the processing is necessary to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>15. Right to provide instructions for the processing of your data after your death</strong><br>
You have the right to set up instructions for the retention, deletion and disclosure of your personal data after your death.<br>
These instructions can be general, covering all your personal data. In this case, they must be registered with a trusted digital third party certified by the CNIL.<br>
The instructions may also be specific to the data processed by our company. You can send your instructions to the following addresses:<br>

When you die, the designated person will then be entitled to be made aware of these instructions and to ask us to implement them. In the absence of a designation, your heirs will be entitled to be made aware of your instructions on your death and to ask us to implement them.<br>
You can change or revoke your instructions at any time by writing to us using the contact details above.</p>
<p><strong>16. Portability of your personal data</strong><br>
You have a right to the portability of the personal data you have provided to us, understood as data that you have actively and consciously declared in the course of accessing and using the services, as well as data generated by your activity in the course of using the services. Keep in mind that this right does not apply to data collected and processed on a legal basis other than consent or the performance of the contract between us.<br>
This right can be exercised free of charge at any time, particularly when closing your account on the Platform, in order to recover and retain your personal data.<br>
In this context, we will send you your personal data, by any means deemed suitable, in a standard open format that is commonly used and machine-readable, in accordance with good practices.</p>
<p><strong>17. Lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority</strong><br>
You are also hereby informed that you have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority (the Commission nationale informatique et libertés for France) in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement of your rights, if you consider that the processing of your personal data hereunder constitutes an infringement of the applicable laws.<br>
This remedy may be exercised without prejudice to any other remedy before an administrative or judicial court. You also have the right to an effective administrative or judicial remedy if you consider that the processing of your personal data hereunder constitutes an infringement of the applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>18. Restriction of processing</strong><br>
You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data in the following cases:<br>
• During the period of verification we carry out, when you dispute the accuracy of your personal data;<br>
• When this data has been unlawfully processed, and you wish to restrict this processing rather than have your data erased;<br>
• When we no longer need your personal data, but you wish to retain it to exercise your rights;<br>
• During the period of verification of legitimate reasons, when you have objected to the processing of your personal data.</p>
<p><strong>19. Changes</strong><br>
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change this policy in whole or in part at any time. These changes will come into force as of the publication of the new charter. Your use of the Solution following the entry into force of these changes will constitute your acknowledgement and acceptance of the new charter. If you do not agree with this new charter, you should no longer access the Solution.</p>
