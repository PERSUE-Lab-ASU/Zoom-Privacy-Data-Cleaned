(referred to as \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\"),  believes in protecting your privacy. We participate in and commit  to adhering to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework which includes  the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer,  security, data integrity, access and enforcement (the \"Principles\")  for all transfers of personal data from EEA to the U.S. When we use  the term \"Sensitive Personal Information\" in this Privacy Shield  Policy, we are referring to a particular subset of an individual\u2019s  Personal Information that provides details of his or her race,  ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or  philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership or that concerns  his or her health. The purpose of this Privacy Shield Policy is to  outline our general practices for implementing the Principles with  respect to the Personal Information we collect. If you would like  to obtain additional information regarding our privacy practices in  connection with information collected on this website in general,  please refer to our online Privacy Policy.</span></p><h2>Principles</h2><p><span><strong>1. Notice.</strong> We will provide you with timely and appropriate notice in our Terms  of Use and Privacy Policy, describing what Personal Information we  are collecting, how we will use that information, and the types of  third parties with whom we may share such information (and  the reasons we do so). Please review these documents carefully.  Where we process personal data on behalf of our business partners,  we will work with them to help them provide appropriate notice to you.<p><strong>2. Choice.</strong> We will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal  Information (or to provide explicit consent for Sensitive Personal  Information) being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than a  service provider as set forth below); or (ii) used for a purpose  materially different from the purpose for which it was originally  collected (as set out in our Privacy Policy), or subsequently  authorized by you, when the circumstances arise. You also have the  ability to opt out at any time from the use of your personal  information for direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right,  please check your settings options. Where we process personal data  on behalf of our business partners, we will work with them to  ensure you are offered appropriate choices (and means to exercise  those choices) for limiting use or disclosure of your personal data  (where appropriate). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that  we may disclose Personal Information under the following  circumstances without offering you an opportunity to opt out of  such disclosure: (i) to our partner institutions and other service  providers that we have retained to perform requested services on  our behalf; (ii) if we are required to do so by law or legal  process; (iii) pursuant to valid requests by law enforcement or  other government authorities (which we are legally required to  respond to); and (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary to  prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an  investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. In addition,  we reserve the right to transfer Personal Information in the event  we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets  (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or  liquidation). Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use  reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the Personal  Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Shield Policy.</p><p><strong>3. Onward Transfers (Transfer to Third Parties).</strong> We will only transfer Personal Information to third parties where  the third party: (i) has provided satisfactory assurances to us  that it will protect the Personal Information in accordance with  this Privacy Shield Policy and the Principles; (ii) is located in  the EU or a country considered \"adequate\" for privacy by the EU  Commission, and therefore is required to comply with the EU data  protection laws or substantially equivalent privacy laws; or (iii)  has certified to Privacy Shield, and is independently responsible  for complying with the Principles. Where we have knowledge that a  third party to whom we have provided Personal Information is  processing that Personal Information in a manner contrary to this  Privacy Shield Policy or the Principles, we will take reasonable  steps to prevent or terminate processing by the third party until  such time the third party can process Personal Information in  compliance with this Privacy Shield Policy and the Principles.  Under certain circumstances, we may be potentially liable if these  requirements are not met.</p><p><strong>4. Data Security.</strong> We will take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect  Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,  disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have implemented  appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to  help safeguard and secure Personal Information from loss, misuse,  unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.</p><p><strong>5. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation.</strong> We will process Personal Information in a manner that is compatible  with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected or  authorized by you. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we  will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is  accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.</p><p><strong>6. Access.</strong> Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the  Personal Information about you that we hold. We will also take  reasonable steps to correct, update, amend or delete any  information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate, except where  the burden or expense of doing so would be disproportionate to the  risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights  of third parties would be violated. Where we process personal data  on behalf of our business partners, we will work with them in  complying with such requests in accordance with applicable law.</p></span></p><h2>Modifications</h2><p><span>We may amend this Privacy Shield Policy from time-to-time in  accordance with the requirements of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield  Framework.

We participate in and commit  to adhering to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework which includes  the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer,  security, data integrity, access and enforcement (the \"Principles\")  for all transfers of personal data from EEA to the U.S. When we use  the term \"Sensitive Personal Information\" in this Privacy Shield  Policy, we are referring to a particular subset of an individual\u2019s  Personal Information that provides details of his or her race,  ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or  philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership or that concerns  his or her health. The purpose of this Privacy Shield Policy is to  outline our general practices for implementing the Principles with  respect to the Personal Information we collect. If you would like  to obtain additional information regarding our privacy practices in  connection with information collected on this website in general,  please refer to our online Privacy Policy.Principles1. Notice. We will provide you with timely and appropriate notice in our Terms  of Use and Privacy Policy, describing what Personal Information we  are collecting, how we will use that information, and the types of  third parties with whom we may share such information (and  the reasons we do so). Please review these documents carefully.  Where we process personal data on behalf of our business partners,  we will work with them to help them provide appropriate notice to you.2. Choice. We will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal  Information (or to provide explicit consent for Sensitive Personal  Information) being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than a  service provider as set forth below); or (ii) used for a purpose  materially different from the purpose for which it was originally  collected (as set out in our Privacy Policy), or subsequently  authorized by you, when the circumstances arise. You also have the  ability to opt out at any time from the use of your personal  information for direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right,  please check your settings options. Where we process personal data  on behalf of our business partners, we will work with them to  ensure you are offered appropriate choices (and means to exercise  those choices) for limiting use or disclosure of your personal data  (where appropriate). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that  we may disclose Personal Information under the following  circumstances without offering you an opportunity to opt out of  such disclosure: (i) to our partner institutions and other service  providers that we have retained to perform requested services on  our behalf; (ii) if we are required to do so by law or legal  process; (iii) pursuant to valid requests by law enforcement or  other government authorities (which we are legally required to  respond to); and (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary to  prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an  investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. In addition,  we reserve the right to transfer Personal Information in the event  we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets  (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or  liquidation). Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use  reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the Personal  Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Shield Policy.3. Onward Transfers (Transfer to Third Parties). We will only transfer Personal Information to third parties where  the third party: (i) has provided satisfactory assurances to us  that it will protect the Personal Information in accordance with  this Privacy Shield Policy and the Principles; (ii) is located in  the EU or a country considered \"adequate\" for privacy by the EU  Commission, and therefore is required to comply with the EU data  protection laws or substantially equivalent privacy laws; or (iii)  has certified to Privacy Shield, and is independently responsible  for complying with the Principles. Where we have knowledge that a  third party to whom we have provided Personal Information is  processing that Personal Information in a manner contrary to this  Privacy Shield Policy or the Principles, we will take reasonable  steps to prevent or terminate processing by the third party until  such time the third party can process Personal Information in  compliance with this Privacy Shield Policy and the Principles.  Under certain circumstances, we may be potentially liable if these  requirements are not met.4. Data Security. We will take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect  Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,  disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have implemented  appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to  help safeguard and secure Personal Information from loss, misuse,  unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.5. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation. We will process Personal Information in a manner that is compatible  with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected or  authorized by you. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we  will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is  accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.6. Access. Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the  Personal Information about you that we hold. We will also take  reasonable steps to correct, update, amend or delete any  information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate, except where  the burden or expense of doing so would be disproportionate to the  risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights  of third parties would be violated. Where we process personal data  on behalf of our business partners, we will work with them in  complying with such requests in accordance with applicable law.ModificationsWe may amend this Privacy Shield Policy from time-to-time in  accordance with the requirements of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield  Framework.
