Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.\n\nWe will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.\n\n7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?\n\nIn Short:\u00a0We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.\n\nOur servers are located in\u00a0the\u00a0United States.

However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.\n\nEuropean Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses:\n\nWe have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations.\u00a0Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request.\u00a0We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.\n\n8.

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other\u00a0unauthorized\u00a0third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

At this stage no uniform technology standard for\u00a0recognizing\u00a0and implementing DNT signals has been\u00a0finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.\n\n13.
