<h2 id="a-introduction">A. Introduction</h2>

<p>This Policy tells you how we use and protect personally identifiable information collected through use of the App and Services.  This Policy covers only information that is collected through this App and our Services.

<h2 id="f-password-and-security">F. Password and security</h2>

<h2 id="g-data-retention">G.  Data Retention</h2>

<p>We will hold your personal data on our systems only for as long as required to provide you with the Services you have requested or to perform the purpose for which that data was collected.</p>

<p>Where you sign up to receive e-mail marketing from us we will retain your e-mail address on file should you ever ‘opt-out’ of receiving e-mails from us. We will retain your e-mail address in this way in order to ensure that we continue to honour and respect that opt-out request.</p>

<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ‘Your Rights’ below for further information.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this data indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

<h2 id="h-international-transfers">H. International Transfers</h2>

<p>Your personal data may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide your personal data to us, we may transfer your personal data to the United States and process it there.</p>

<p>If you would like more information about how the mechanism via which your personal data is transferred, please contact <a href="mailto:support@noomin.us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">support@noomin.us</a>.</p>

<h2 id="i-applicability">I. Applicability</h2>

<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Policy, this Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are users on the App or other Apps throughout the Internet, different rules may apply.</p>

<p>The App and Services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the Services of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these external websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these websites or their policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to these external websites.</p>

<h2 id="j-children">J. Children</h2>

<p>The App and Services are not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from such children. If you are younger than thirteen, please do not provide any personally identifiable information to us.  If a person 13 years of age or younger has provided personal information to us, a parent or guardian of such person should contact us at <a href="mailto:support@noomin.us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">support@noomin.us</a> so that we can remove such personal information from our database.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to limit participation in particular programs, offers or promotions to those over 18 years of age.</p>

<h2 id="k-your-rights">K. Your Rights</h2>

<p>As a data subject you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.</p>

<h3 id="right-of-access">Right of Access</h3>

<p>You may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (you may have heard of this right being described as a "subject access request").</p>

<p>Please note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to your personal data.</p>

<p>You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out <a href="mailto:feedback@noomin.us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feedback@noomin.us</a> and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.</p>

<h3 id="your-right-to-rectification-and-erasure">Your Right to Rectification and Erasure</h3>

<p>You may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be forgotten”). To do this, we recommend that you log into the App or Services.</p>

<p>We will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.</p>

<p>You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<h3 id="your-right-to-restrict-processing">Your Right to Restrict Processing</h3>

<p>Where we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the sections of this Policy which explain how and why we use your information) you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.</p>

<p>We may process your data on the basis of a legitimate interest in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Optimized App content</li>
<li>Track products and services that are popular</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us verify that data's accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>

<p>Please note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it.</p>

<p>You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out <a href="mailto:support@noomin.us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">support@noomin.us</a> and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.</p>

<h3 id="your-right-to-portability">Your Right to Portability</h3>

<p>Where you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means, to a third party you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.
Because of the kind of work that we do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party we are happy to consider such requests.</p>

<h3 id="your-right-to-stop-receiving-communications">Your Right to stop receiving communications</h3>

<p>Where we send you e-mail marketing communications (or other regulated electronic messages) you have the right to opt-out at any time. You can do this by using the ‘unsubscribe’ link that appears in the footer of each communication (or the equivalent mechanism in those communications).</p>

<p>Alternatively, if for any reason you cannot use those links, or if you would prefer to contact us directly – you can unsubscribe by writing to us at <a href="mailto:support@noomin.us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">support@noomin.us</a> and telling us which communications you would like us to stop sending you.</p>

<h3 id="your-right-to-object-to-automated-decision-making-and-profiling">Your Right to object to automated decision making and profiling</h3>

<p>You have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.</p>

<h3 id="exercising-your-rights">Exercising your rights</h3>

<p>When you write to us making a request to exercise your rights we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID documents to help us to verify your identity.</p>

<p>It will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific you can be, the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with sufficient information then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional information (and where this is the case we will tell you).</p>

<h2 id="l-jurisdiction">L. Jurisdiction</h2>

<p>Noominus, Inc. is located in the United States, as are the servers that make the App available.  All matters relating to privacy issues are governed by the laws of the United States.</p>

<h2 id="m-policy-changes">M. Policy Changes</h2>

<p>We may amend this Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the App, which will automatically take effect after they are initially posted except as otherwise specified. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice in the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>

<h2 id="n-contact-details">N. Contact Details</h2>

<p>You may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@noomin.us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">support@noomin.us</a> to request access, correction or deletion of any information we have about you, or to submit questions or complaints about this Policy.</p>
