You must only provide us with Billing and Financial Account Information for accounts and credit cards that you have the lawful right to access. All payment information is handled only by PCI compliant organizations. When paying with a credit card we do store (or our payment processor on our behalf will store) just the last four digits of your credit card number to comply with credit card processing requirements of authorizations, charges and chargebacks.

We work with third parties to provide Behavioral Advertising, such as advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, \u201cAdvertising Service Providers\u201d).\u00a0 Advertising Service Providers perform services such as facilitating targeting of advertisements and measuring and analyzing advertising effectiveness on the Service (collectively, all such services, \u201cTargeting Services\u201d). Targeting Services help us display Behavioral Advertising, prevent you from seeing repeated ads, and enable us to research the usefulness of ads. We adhere to self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising issued by the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cEDAA\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cOBA Principles\u201d).

Web Beacons are embedded in, or otherwise associated with, certain emails or other communications that you receive from us or our partners. Web Beacons help us track your responses and interests and deliver relevant content and services to you. For example, they may let us know when you take actions based on the emails that we send. Web Beacons also allow us to enhance our Behavioral Advertising (defined below), which is further discussed below in the section titled \u201cOnline Behavioral Advertising\u201d below. Social Media Widgets: some parts of our Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook \u201clike\u201d button, and widgets, such as the \u201cshare this\u201d button. These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Service. When you use these tools, the party that provides the tool, the third party that operates the social media services, and/or we may receive Personal Data about you. By using these tools, you acknowledge that some information, including Personal Data, from your social media services will be transmitted to us, and that information is therefore is covered by this Privacy Policy, and some information, including Personal Data, may be shared with the third party services, and that information is therefore governed by their privacy policies.

We work with third parties to provide Behavioral Advertising, such as advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, \u201cAdvertising Service Providers\u201d).\u00a0 Advertising Service Providers perform services such as facilitating targeting of advertisements and measuring and analyzing advertising effectiveness on the Service (collectively, all such services, \u201cTargeting Services\u201d).

The Service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave our Service. 6.

If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or use a different device, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. 2.
