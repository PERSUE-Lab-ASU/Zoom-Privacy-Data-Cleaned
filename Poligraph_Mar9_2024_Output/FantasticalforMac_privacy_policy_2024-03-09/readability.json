We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently for any revisions or amendments. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Sites and will be effective immediately upon posting.

The specific requirements of this Privacy Policy apply unless disallowed by applicable laws or regulations.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section id=\"collection\">\n        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>\n\n        <h3>Personal Information</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          We collect information that personally identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with you (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d), including:\n        </p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <em>Identifiers</em> such as name, email address, IP address, billing address, phone number, device ID;\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <em>Commercial Information</em> such as transaction history, payment method information, content of correspondence with us such as emails, chats, or text messages, crash reports, usage analytics, customer satisfaction surveys;\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <em>User-Created Data</em> such as events, tasks, meeting proposals, reminders, contacts, calendar names, meeting templates, notes; and\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <em>Geolocation Information</em> (approximate).\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          The specific Personal Information we collect about you may vary based on how you use the Sites and/or Services and your relationship with us such as if you are a user of our products or if you are a contact person for a company with which we do business.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>User-Created Data</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          When using our Services, you may create data such as calendars, events, tasks, and more that we refer to in this Privacy Policy as \u201cUser-Created Data\u201d. We believe that User-Created Data should be kept on-device and not sent to us to the greatest extent possible; however, there will be times when User-Created Data will need to be sent to us in connection with providing the Services to you. We also believe that it is important for our users to understand how their User-Created Data is handled. Accordingly, we have created a <a href=\"file:///privacy/faq\">Privacy at Flexibits FAQ</a> which explains in more detail the instances when we need to receive and process User-Created Data off-device and steps we take to limit our ability to access User-Created Data as much as reasonably possible when it is stored on or transmitted through our servers.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Sites Activity</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          We may automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Sites using a tool called <a href=\"https://matomo.org/\">Matomo</a>.

This information is anonymized and therefore is not considered Personal Information as defined in this Privacy Policy.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Usage Analytics</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          Depending on which of our applications you use, we may collect analytics information about your use of our applications in order to understand how our applications are being used so we can improve them. This analytics data is transmitted to us approximately every 24-48 hours. This data may be anonymized and therefore, if anonymized, is not considered Personal Information as defined in this Privacy Policy. If you are using an application that collects analytics data, we will give you the option to disable analytics in your in-application account settings.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Communication Recordings</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          We may retain the content of text messages or other written/electronic communications between you and us.

For example, we may require you to verify certain information in our files or submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury verifying your identity. We will not process requests without verifying your identity, so please respond promptly.

If you request access to specific Personal Information and that information creates a high risk of potential harm from disclosure to an unauthorized person, we will withhold that information and replace it with a category identifier and/or redacted information. For example, if we withhold a payment card number, we will inform you that we have a payment card number on file and we may provide you with the card type and the last four digits of the card number.

(\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d) works hard to build and maintain a relationship of trust with you. This Privacy Policy (the \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) governs our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information (as defined below) in connection with your use of our website(s) on which this Privacy Policy is linked (the \u201cSites\u201d), such as www.flexibits.com and any services, transactions, or other engagements you might have with us including your use of our applications (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d).\n        \n\n        \n          This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you, how we use or disclose such information, how to exercise any rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information (including any rights to opt-out of certain uses of your information), and the safeguards we have in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and use. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the Personal Information (defined below) of our employees, independent contractors, and job applicants.\n        \n\n        \n          Please carefully read this Privacy Policy, which is part of our Terms of Service, before using our Sites and/or Services. If you do not agree with our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, you must refrain from using our Sites/Services. By accessing or using our Sites or Services, you agree to our use of your information consistent with our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY\n\n        Privacy Policy Changes\n\n        \n          This Privacy Policy is subject to change. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently for any revisions or amendments. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Sites and will be effective immediately upon posting. You will be deemed to have been made aware of and have accepted the changes by your continued use of our Sites or Services. If we determine that a change to this Privacy Policy will result in using your Personal Information acquired before the change being used in a materially new way, we will provide you notice before using your Personal Information in the new way such as by sending you an email, posting a notice on our Sites, or sending a notice through our applications.\n        \n\n        Conflict Between this Policy and Laws and Regulations\n\n        \n          When federal, state, or local laws and regulations require a higher level of protection for your Personal Information, they take precedence over this Privacy Policy. The specific requirements of this Privacy Policy apply unless disallowed by applicable laws or regulations.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        INFORMATION WE COLLECT\n\n        Personal Information\n\n        \n          We collect information that personally identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with you (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d), including:\n        \n\n        \n          \n            Identifiers such as name, email address, IP address, billing address, phone number, device ID;\n          \n          \n            Commercial Information such as transaction history, payment method information, content of correspondence with us such as emails, chats, or text messages, crash reports, usage analytics, customer satisfaction surveys;\n          \n          \n            User-Created Data such as events, tasks, meeting proposals, reminders, contacts, calendar names, meeting templates, notes; and\n          \n          \n            Geolocation Information (approximate).\n          \n        \n\n        \n          The specific Personal Information we collect about you may vary based on how you use the Sites and/or Services and your relationship with us such as if you are a user of our products or if you are a contact person for a company with which we do business.\n        \n\n        User-Created Data\n\n        \n          When using our Services, you may create data such as calendars, events, tasks, and more that we refer to in this Privacy Policy as \u201cUser-Created Data\u201d. We believe that User-Created Data should be kept on-device and not sent to us to the greatest extent possible; however, there will be times when User-Created Data will need to be sent to us in connection with providing the Services to you. We also believe that it is important for our users to understand how their User-Created Data is handled. Accordingly, we have created a Privacy at Flexibits FAQ which explains in more detail the instances when we need to receive and process User-Created Data off-device and steps we take to limit our ability to access User-Created Data as much as reasonably possible when it is stored on or transmitted through our servers.\n        \n\n        Sites Activity\n\n        \n          We may automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Sites using a tool called Matomo. For example, each time you visit our website, we may automatically collect the type of web browser you use, the type of device you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, the pages you view, referring and exit pages, the date and time of your visit, the number of clicks to, from, and within the Sites, and the duration of your visits to the Sites. This information is anonymized and therefore is not considered Personal Information as defined in this Privacy Policy.\n        \n\n        Usage Analytics\n\n        \n          Depending on which of our applications you use, we may collect analytics information about your use of our applications in order to understand how our applications are being used so we can improve them. This analytics data is transmitted to us approximately every 24-48 hours. This data may be anonymized and therefore, if anonymized, is not considered Personal Information as defined in this Privacy Policy. If you are using an application that collects analytics data, we will give you the option to disable analytics in your in-application account settings.\n        \n\n        Communication Recordings\n\n        \n          We may retain the content of text messages or other written/electronic communications between you and us. By communicating with us, you consent to our recording and retention of communications.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION\n\n        Voluntary Disclosure\n\n        \n          We may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you communicate with us (online or offline), use the Sites, purchase Services, and at other times. You are not required to provide us your Personal Information; however, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Sites or Services or we may not be able to fulfill your requested interaction.\n        \n\n        Cookies\n\n        \n          We use cookies in a few instances.

Each Service Provider is expected to use reasonable security measures appropriate to the nature of the information involved to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by us.\n        \n\n        \n          You may also be asked to provide Personal Information directly to a Service Provider. For example, we may connect you with a payment processor and request that you provide Personal Information directly to them.\n        \n\n        \n          Additional information about certain Service Providers we use to whom we disclose your Personal Information can be found in our Privacy at Flexibits FAQ.\n        \n\n        Third-Party Selling and Targeted Advertising\n\n        \n          We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties under any circumstance.

For example, we may disclose certain Personal Information if you request that we share a calendar invitation to a third party, we may disclose your approximate geolocation with AccuWeather if your application provides the weather at your location but we will not do so in a way that identifies you, or we may permit you to integrate our Services with Apple Maps.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        OTHER PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS\n\n        Security\n\n        \n          We recognize the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of Personal Information from loss, misuse, or alteration. Accordingly, we employ commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect such Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, and use. Even with these safeguards, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through our Sites or Services, you do so at your own risk.\n        \n\n        Other Websites & App Stores\n\n        \n          Please be aware that third-party websites or app stores accessible through the Sites or recommended through our Services may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. We are not responsible for any actions, content of websites, or privacy policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information.\n        \n\n        Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement\n\n        \n          We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to respond to legal requests (including court orders, investigative demands, and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property, or rights of ourselves, consumers, or any other third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with law. We have not made any such disclosures in the past twelve months.\n        \n\n        Other Transfers\n\n        \n          We may disclose Personal Information among businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with us. If we are merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information in connection with such transaction.

For example, if we withhold a payment card number, we will inform you that we have a payment card number on file and we may provide you with the card type and the last four digits of the card number. If you have an online account with us, we will provide the response to your request via the online account, otherwise, we will give you the option to choose between mail and electronic delivery.
