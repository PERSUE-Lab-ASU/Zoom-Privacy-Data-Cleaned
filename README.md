# Zoom Privacy Data

This repository contains processed and raw data related to privacy policies and permissions for applications on the Zoom Marketplace. The data and scripts in this codebase are organized to facilitate analysis of data collection practices and permission changes over time.

## Repository Structure

- **Zoom_Store_Permissions_Data/**  
  Weekly snapshots of permissions required by all apps listed on the Zoom Marketplace, allowing for longitudinal analysis of permission changes over time.

- **Direct_Root_Leaf_Script.py**  
  The script that processes Poligrah output folders and generates direct root-to-leaf CSVs for each app.
  
- **Poligraph_Feb9_2025_Output/**  
  Raw output data from Poligrah for privacy policies as of February 9, 2025. Each subdirectory represents an app and contains extracted graph data.

- **Poligraph_Mar9_2024_Output/**  
  Raw output data from Poligrah for privacy policies as of March 9, 2024. Each subdirectory represents an app and contains extracted graph data.

- **Direct_Root_Leaf_Feb9_2025/**  
  CSV files generated by the Direct Root Leaf Script, using the data from `Poligraph_Feb9_2025_Output`. Each CSV represents a direct root-to-leaf path for an app, showing detailed data collection by each party.

- **Direct_Root_Leaf_Mar9_2024/**  
  CSV files generated by the Direct Root Leaf Script, using the data from `Poligraph_Mar9_2024_Output`. Each CSV represents a direct root-to-leaf path for an app, showing detailed data collection by each party.




## Usage

1. **Analyzing Privacy Policy Data**  
   - Use the data in `Poligraph_Feb9_2025_Output/` and `Poligraph_Mar9_2024_Output/` for raw graph representations.
   - Run `Direct_Root_Leaf_Script.py` to generate direct root-to-leaf graphs for detailed analysis. The output will be stored in the corresponding `Direct_Root_Leaf_Feb9_2025/` or `Direct_Root_Leaf_Mar9_2024/` folders.

2. **Tracking App Permissions**  
   - Explore the `Zoom_Store_Permissions_Data/` directory to see how app permissions evolve week by week.
