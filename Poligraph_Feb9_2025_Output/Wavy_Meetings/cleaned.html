    <h3 id="collection_and_use_of_personal_information">COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    We may collect personal information when you:
    <ul type="1">
        <li>Register for an Experience</li>
        <li>Participate in an Experience</li>
        <li>Request a Meeting or Demo</li>
        <li>Engage with us through social media</li>
        <li>Sign-up to receive marketing emails such as newsletters and blog posts</li>
        <li>Enter a contest or participate in a promotion</li>
        <li>Participate in our surveys</li>
        <li>Contact us with a comment, feedback, question, or complaint</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>Register for an Experience:</b> You do not have to register to visit or use our Website. However, if you choose to
        participate in an Experience, we require certain information in order to facilitate the Experience (this may
        include
        the delivery of virtual gift cards and/or the sending of meeting links to join the Experience). The information
        we
        collect may include your first and last name, email address, and payment card information (if applicable).
        Please note that
        if the Experience you will be participating in involves the delivery of a kit (e.g. physical items such as food
        ingredients in the case of a cooking-related Experience), we will also collect your home address and phone
        number, which may be shared with any of our Fulfilment Partners (defined under the "Sharing of Personal
        Information" section below) involved
        in your upcoming Experience. If you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account, you are
        required to notify us immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Participate in an Experience:</b> All of our Experiences are recorded. We use these recordings to help us assess the
        quality
        of each Experience and improve Experiences in the future by collecting information such as the number of
        Participants in
        attendance and general Participant engagement levels. We may also share the recording of an Experience with your
        employer (or other team leader through which you signed up for an Experience) and use short recording snippets
        of a
        recording for marketing purposes with your consent. We do not share Experience recordings with anyone other than
        Wavy
        employees. Please note that we use platforms such as Zoom, Teams and other providers to host Experiences. Please
        refer
        to those platforms‘ privacy policies for further information about how your personal information may be
        processed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Request a Meeting/Demo:</b> If you choose to request a meeting/demo with us through our Website, we will ask
        for certain
        information from you in order to connect with you and prepare for a telephone meeting, including your first
        name,
        pronoun, work email, company name, and team size.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Wavy‘s Blog:</b> Following an Experience, we may ask Participants to provide a testimonial about their
        Experience to
        feature
        on our Website‘s Blog in order to provide future Wavy Participants with information about different types of
        Experiences
        and past Participant feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Social Media:</b> We may offer you the opportunity to engage with our content and/or services on or through
        third-party
        social networking websites, plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our content and/or services on or
        through
        third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain
        information associated with your social media account (e.g., name, username, email address, profile picture,
        gender)
        to
        deliver the content or as part of the operation of the website, plug-in or application. When you provide
        information
        from your social media account, we may use this information to personalize your experience on the Website and on
        the
        third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, and to provide you with other services you
        may
        request.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Marketing Communications:</b> If you sign-up to receive email marketing communications such as newsletters,
        we collect
        your email address as well as other information on an optional basis to help us tailor our communications to
        you. You can
        unsubscribe at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link included at the bottom of each email. Alternatively,
        you
        can opt-out of receiving email marketing communications by contacting us at the contact information provided in
        the
        "Contact Us" section below. Please note that you may continue to receive transactional or
        account-related communications from
        us.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Surveys:</b> Following an Experience, we may ask you to fill a survey to obtain feedback about your Wavy
        Experience. We
        may
        also email you a survey prior to an Experience involving your company or other team you are a part of in order
        to
        determine your team‘s level of interest in various Experiences. These surveys are anonymous (unless you choose
        to
        provide your email address for the purpose of a future feedback interview) and the information obtained through
        our
        surveys is used in an aggregated, de-identified form. We use this information to help us improve future
        Experiences,
        understand our customers, and enhance our Website and other offerings.

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Contact Us:</b> When you contact us with a comment, question or complaint through email, telephone, our
        Website Chat, or
        the
        Contact Us form on our Website, you may be asked for information that identifies you, such as your first name,
        email
        address and telephone number, along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question
        or
        respond to your comment. We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer
        service
        and service offerings.

        purposes
        of
        investigating a breach of an agreement or contravention of law or detecting, suppressing or preventing fraud, or

        otherwise may be required or permitted by applicable Canadian, U.S. or other law or legal process, which may

        <b>Third Party Links:</b> Our Website may contain links to other websites that Wavy does not own or operate. We

        we
        work
        with) as a convenience to the user. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked
        websites. The linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies, notices and terms of use. We do
        not
        have
        any control over such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the
        organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat
        personal
        information. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.
    </p>


    <h4>Interest-Based Advertising</h4>

    <p>
        We work with third-parties such as ad networks and other advertising companies that use their own tracking
        technologies
        (including cookies and pixel tags) on our Website in order to provide you with tailored advertisements across
        the
        Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our Website and third-party websites
        (such
        as
        web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information
        to
        make
        predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver ads that are more relevant to you
        on
        third
        party websites. This information may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our online advertising
        campaigns.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising:</b> For more information about interest-based advertising and to
        understand
        your
        options, including how you can opt-out of receiving behavioural ads from third-party advertising companies
        participating
        in the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website
        at
        <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices" target="_blank">http://youradchoices.ca/choices</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies
        may
        still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will
        not be
        targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your
        interests.
    </p>

    <p>
        To successfully opt out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser (see your browser‘s instructions for
        information on cookies and how to enable them). Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must
        opt-out
        of each web browser on each computer you use. Once you opt out, if you delete your browser‘s saved cookies, you
        will
        need to opt-out again.
