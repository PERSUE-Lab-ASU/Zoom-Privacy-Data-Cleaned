As the processor for Customer Content, Miro processes Customer Content that is Personal Data only on Customer\u2019s request and in accordance with Customer\u2019s written instructions, including the applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, Customer\u2019s use of the Services, and as required by applicable law.
