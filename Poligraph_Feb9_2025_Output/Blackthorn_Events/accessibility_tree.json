PROVIDER and Practice each acknowledge and agree that any controversy, disagreement, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the Services or the Authorization or this Agreement, or any breach in connection therewith or herewith (each, a \u201cDispute\u201d), will be settled by following the procedures set forth below: (a) PROVIDER, on the one hand, and Practice, on the other hand, agree first to contact the other to advise of any such Dispute. The party alleging, asserting and/or initiating the Dispute shall contact the other party or parties who is or are alleged to be liable or responsible for such Dispute, and provide a written description of the Dispute, all relevant documents/information and the proposed resolution (the \u201cClaim Notice\u201d). Practice agrees to contact PROVIDER, Blackthorn.io, Inc., as contemplated above by writing to or calling: 228 Park Ave S, PMB 36824, New York, NY 10003-1502. +1.917.509.5971. (b) Practice and the Claims Administrator for PROVIDER shall then seek in good faith to resolve the Dispute. As part of this process, each party to the Dispute shall provide a monetary amount that, if paid to the party alleging, asserting and/or initiating the Dispute, would settle the Dispute (the \u201cSettlement Amount\u201d). If the parties do not agree to a Settlement Amount, or the parties are otherwise unable to settle the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of the Claim Notice, then the parties shall proceed to arbitration, as set forth below. (c) IN THE ABSENCE OF RESOLVING THE DISPUTE, AND INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, PROVIDER AND PRACTICE EACH AGREE TO SETTLE AND RESOLVE FULLY AND FINALLY ALL DISPUTES EXCLUSIVELY BY ARBITRATION, EXCEPT IN THE FOLLOWING LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES: (I) PROVIDER OR PRACTICE MAY COMMENCE AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT WHERE THE AMOUNT OF THE DISPUTE DOES NOT EXCEED THE JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT OF SUCH COURT; AND (II) PRACTICE MAY FILE A DISPUTE WITH ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY THAT CAN, IF THE LAW SO AUTHORIZES, SEEK RELIEF AGAINST PROVIDER ON BEHALF OF PRACTICE. THE AGREEMENT TO HAVE DISPUTES RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION IS MADE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH PARTY IS IRREVOCABLY, KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVING AND RELEASING ITS RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE DISPUTES. Without limitation, PROVIDER and Practice agree that Disputes, as defined above, shall include the following matters: (a) any Dispute by any party against any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the other party or parties, including to the full extent permitted by applicable law, third parties who are not parties to the Authorization or the Agreement, whether related to the Services or otherwise; (b) any past, present, and future Dispute; and (c) any Dispute as to the scope, validity or applicability of this Dispute Resolution provision, and/or the arbitrability of any Dispute; and (d) any Dispute against PROVIDER, or any other party as stated above, related in any way to the Services, including, but not limited to, the characterization of the transactions referenced in the Authorization or the Agreement, privacy, solicitation, or advertising, even if it arises after the SR Website Service has terminated. (d) The foregoing arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the \u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect when a Claim Notice is duly provided. If any AAA procedure or rule conflicts with the terms of the Authorization or the Agreement, the Authorization or the Agreement, as applicable, will apply. (e) The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16. Any award by the arbitrator may be entered as a judgment in any court having jurisdiction. Any arbitrator\u2019s decision and award is final and binding, subject only to those exceptions under the FAA. PROVIDER and Practice agree the FAA\u2019s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. (f) Unless PROVIDER and Practice agree otherwise, the foregoing arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator selected by utilizing the process provided in the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect when Claim Notice is duly filed. The arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney and/or retired judge. Except as otherwise provided below, the arbitration shall be conducted in the county where the principal address of the party against whom the Dispute is initially commenced is located \u2013 and for any claim against PROVIDER, that address shall be Blackthorn.io, Inc., 228 Park Ave S, PMB 36824, New York, NY 10003-1502. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, consequential or other monetary damages not measured by the prevailing party\u2019s actual damages, except as may be required by statute or as otherwise provided below. (g) The award of the arbitrator shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. (h) For Disputes of $10,000.00 or less that are initiated by Practice (\u201cSmall Disputes\u201d), the following rules shall apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the procedures or rules of the AAA: (1) The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA\u2019s Expedited Procedures. (2) The arbitrator shall include a finding as to whether the initiation of such Dispute was frivolous. If it is determined by the arbitrator not to be frivolous, then PROVIDER shall pay the fees and costs assessed by the AAA in administering the arbitration. (3) If the arbitrator finds that PROVIDER is liable to Practice for an amount greater than the Settlement Amount presented by PROVIDER prior to the commencement of arbitration (after all offsets and counterclaims are applied), then PROVIDER shall be required to pay in addition to any award of the arbitrator an amount equal to the greater of (x) $500.00, or (y) the amount of Practice\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. (4) Practice may choose to conduct the arbitration in the state of its principal address. (i) PROVIDER AND PRACTICE EACH AGREE NOT TO PURSUE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING."}]}, {"role": "section", "name": "", "children": [{"role": "whitespace", "name": "\n"}]}, {"role": "section", "name": "", "children": [{"role": "text leaf", "name": "15.
