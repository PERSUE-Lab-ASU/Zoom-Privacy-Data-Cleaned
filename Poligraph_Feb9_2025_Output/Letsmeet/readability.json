However, there are several common traits about how we handle the data, regardless of type:Appcues\u00a0never sell this data to third parties.\u00a0In limited cases, we provide it to third-party services for usage strictly within the Appcues product or business; for example, to provide analytics graphs on the Appcues dashboard.All data is subject to the protections of the General Data Protection Regulation, in the case it originates from the European Union.Type 1: End-user PIIThis data can be used to identify a specific user. Examples of end-user PII include:User profile data passed to Appcues by the customer, using the `Appcues.identify()` SDK function;Browser information that is collected by default in the Appcues SDK (e.g., OS, device type, browser language, user agent), when associated with a particular user; andBrowsing history data that is collected by default in the Appcues SDK (e.g., current page URL, current page title).Again, like all data we collect, Appcues\u00a0never sell end-user PII to third parties.\u200dType 2: End-user Appcues DataThis data pertains to how end users are interacting with Appcues content; for example, whether a flow was shown to a given user, whether a user has interacted with a tooltip, etc. This category also includes user responses to in-Appcues forms or surveys.Appcues does not actively collect PII for use in this category, and no PII is required in this category in order to use Appcues. Note, however, that form or survey responses may add PII to this data.Appcues uses data in this category to customize and deliver Appcues content, as well as display analytics on the Appcues dashboard.It is this data stream which is available for CSV download on the Appcues dashboard.UXCAMWe use UXCam, which is an analytics solution. UXCam may record: Screens visited, Interaction patterns (such as screen actions, gestures: taps, scrolls), and Device details (Type, Version, Model, Operating System). We are using the information collected by UXCam to improve our app.UXCam stores and processes this information on our behalf and may contain personally identifiable information although\u00a0we proactively remove it where possible.For more information visit UXCam Privacy Policy.CHARTER UPDATEThe Company may be required to amend this Charter at any time, in particular as a result of:The introduction of new services or new technologiesChanges in the legislative and regulatory frameworkIn the interest of transparency, the Company invites the persons concerned to consult this page as often as they wish to take note of any changes.", "length": 40401, "excerpt": "Last updated on the\u00a01st of June 2023.", "siteName": null, "applied": false}
