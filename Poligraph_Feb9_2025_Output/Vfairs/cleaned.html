<h4 id="overview-section">OVERVIEW</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">vFairs LLC (“vFairs”, “We” or “Our”) has drafted this Privacy Policy to ensure that you can clearly understand our personal information practices as you use vFairs Platform (the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our collection, use, and disclosure of your information. We also describe in this Privacy Policy the measures we take to protect the security of your Personal Information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy may be posted on one of the Sites that we run for a customer (“Customer Site”). On a Customer Site, vFairs is collecting, using and sharing your Personal Information on behalf of our customer rather than vFairs. Please contact the customer for information about how they will collect, use and share your Personal Information. The customer is in control of the Customer Site, and it is operated by vFairs on its behalf subject to the terms of the agreement with the customer. Subject to the foregoing, this Privacy Policy describes generally how vFairs uses data in connection with the typical Customer Site, as well as use by vFairs from any interactions separate from the Customer Site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Customer Site may also enable you to interact with third parties (“Third Party”) similar to an in person job fair or trade show. In this event, your Personal Information may be collected, used and shared by the Third Party according to any terms established between our customer and the Third Party, as well as the policies of the Third Party, and your own choices and settings. The relationship with the Third Party is managed by our customer and not vFairs.</span></p>

When you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you consent to our use and disclosure of the information we collect or receive as described in this Privacy Policy and you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the policy.</span></p>

This also includes the conversation (chat) history from conversations with any other participant and/or organization. If providing information for an Event, this information may become subject to the policies of the respective company(ies) after it has been shared, as vFairs is not responsible for these policies. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share your Personal Information with third party contractors or service providers to provide you with the services that we offer you through our Sites; to provide technical support, or to provide specific services in accordance with your instructions.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of vFairs, our customers, or other users of the Sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should be aware that any Personal Information you submit on the Sites may be read, collected, or used by other users of vFairs, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">vFairs maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist us in protecting the Personal Information we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that no electronic transmission of information can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard Personal Information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information will always remain private. As a user of the Sites, you understand and agree that you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Sites, the internet generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off the sites.
