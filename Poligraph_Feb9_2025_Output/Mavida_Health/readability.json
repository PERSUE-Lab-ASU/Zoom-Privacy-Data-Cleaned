Policy</h2><div><p>Last Revised October 16, 2023</p><div><h2>1. Introduction</h2><p>This Privacy Policy describes how Mavida Health, Inc. (<b>\u201cMavida,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d</b> or <b>\u201cus\u201d</b>) collects and uses Personal Information about you through the use of our Website, mobile applications and through email, text, and other electronic communications between you and Mavida. Mavida respects your privacy, and we are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy (our <b>\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d</b>) describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit mavidahealth.com or any of our affiliated websites where this Policy is posted (collectively, <b>\u201cWebsite\u201d</b>) and the Mavida application (<b>\u201cApplication\u201d</b>, together with the Website referred to as the <b>\u201cSite\u201d</b>) and use our services available through the Site and Application (the <b>\u201cServices</b>) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. This policy applies to information we collect on our Site and Services; in emails, text message, phone conversations, audio and video interactions and other electronic messages between you and our Site and Services; when you interact with our advertising and applications on third party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this policy. It does not apply to information collected by us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Mavida or any third party; any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Site or Services.</p><p>In order to understand how we use your personal information, we need to explain Mavida\u2019s legal organization because it affects how we use your personal information. For purposes of clarification, Mavida Health, Inc. does not provide any medical or clinical services. As further described in our Terms of Service, Mavida operates the Site and Services. Associated but independent clinical practices, including Mavida Care Group of California, P.C., Perinatal Maternal Psychiatry of New York, P.C., or other United States based health care providers (each, a \u201cProvider\u201d), provide the licensed professionals who treat you on the Site. Both Mavida Health, Inc. and the Providers (collectively, <b>\u201cMavida,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d</b> or <b>\u201cus\u201d</b>) may use and disclose your personal information collected through the Site and Services, but how we use and disclose that information depends on whether it is health information or another type of personal information. <b>If you do not agree to be bound by those terms, you are not authorized to access or use our Site or Services, and you must promptly exit our Site or Services.</b></p><p>We believe that your health information should have heightened privacy protections, which are also required by certain federal and state privacy laws.

We treat all health information that you provide when becoming a patient with us and via interacting with your Provider as health information under the Provider\u2019s Notice of Privacy Practices. That means if we need to collect, use, or disclose that health information for any reason, we follow the Notice of Privacy Practices. Please review the Notice of Privacy Practices for more information on how we protect your health information and your rights under applicable laws.</p><p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.

IntroductionThis Privacy Policy describes how Mavida Health, Inc.

This Privacy Policy (our \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit mavidahealth.com or any of our affiliated websites where this Policy is posted (collectively, \u201cWebsite\u201d) and the Mavida application (\u201cApplication\u201d, together with the Website referred to as the \u201cSite\u201d) and use our services available through the Site and Application (the \u201cServices) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. This policy applies to information we collect on our Site and Services; in emails, text message, phone conversations, audio and video interactions and other electronic messages between you and our Site and Services; when you interact with our advertising and applications on third party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this policy.

For purposes of clarification, Mavida Health, Inc. does not provide any medical or clinical services. As further described in our Terms of Service, Mavida operates the Site and Services. Associated but independent clinical practices, including Mavida Care Group of California, P.C., Perinatal Maternal Psychiatry of New York, P.C., or other United States based health care providers (each, a \u201cProvider\u201d), provide the licensed professionals who treat you on the Site.
