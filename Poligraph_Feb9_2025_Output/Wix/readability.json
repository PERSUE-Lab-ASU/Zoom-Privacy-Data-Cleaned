For example, we may share your Personal Information with Wix.com Inc., our US-based subsidiary, in the course of facilitating and providing you (and your Users-of-Users) with our Services.\nSharing Personal Information by Wix subsidiaries and affiliated companies in the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland with Wix\u2019s subsidiaries located outside these regions will only take place under an approved transfer mechanism, such as the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses.4.5. In connection with a change in corporate control:In addition, should Wix or any of its affiliates undergo any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all of its assets, your Personal Information may be shared with the parties involved in such event.4.6.

If you choose to engage with such Third Party Services, they may have access to and process Personal Information of your Users-of-Users collected through your web or mobile sites. For example:\n\na) Framed Pages: our Services may enable you to integrate Third Party Services directly into your web or mobile sites, such as via page framing techniques to serve content to or from Third Party Services\u00a0 or other parties (\u201cFrames\u201d).

These Social Media Features may collect certain Personal Information from your Users-of-Users such as identifiers, including name, alias, unique personal identifier, online identifier, internet protocol address, email address, or other similar identifiers. Social Media Features are hosted either by a third party or directly on our Services.\n\nPlease note that in the examples listed above in this Section 4.6, Wix merely acts as an intermediary platform allowing you to procure the services of such Third Party Services (including, but not limited to, Third Party Developers, Third Party Apps and Social Media Features) with which you are interacting directly, and at your discretion. In this respect, Wix acts as a service provider to you, disclosing information to the Third Party Services on your behalf. Wix will share your Users-of-Users\u2019 Personal Information with Third Parties Services only upon your direction or with your permission and is not, and shall not be, in any way responsible for such Third Party Services processing of such Personal Information, or liable with respect thereto.\n\nWix does not control and is not responsible for the actions or policies of any Third Party Service, and your use of any Third Party Service is at your own risk. We encourage you to review any privacy policy accompanying a Third Party Service and ask such Third Party Service for any clarifications you may need before deciding to install and/or use their services.5.
