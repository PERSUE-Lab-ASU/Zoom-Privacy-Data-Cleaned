You will be able to change your Privacy Preferences at any time throughout your time using the Platform and thereafter.</p><h3>Purpose of this Privacy Statement</h3><p>HeySummit's purpose in establishing this Privacy Statement is to give you information about how HeySummit collects and processes your personal data through your use of the HeySummit Services, including any data you may provide through the HeySummit platform. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the HeySummit Services, websites or any other aspect of HeySummit’s business.</p><p>This Privacy Statement applies to all users of HeySummits Platform and associated technology. It is important that you read this Privacy Statement together with any other Privacy Statement or fair processing policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting, or processing, personal data about You, so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This Privacy Statement supplements other notices and privacy policies and is not intended to override them.</p><h3>Controller/Processor</h3><p>Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of information. HeySummit and Event hosts are independent controllers of certain types of your personal data, such as your registration data (like name and email) and attendance data (like Event name, date and time of Event, and Event sessions attended). Event hosts are the controller, and HeySummit is the processor of Event data, such as information and materials submitted to, or during an Event.</p><h3>Changes to our Privacy Statement and your duty to inform us of changes to your personal data</h3><p>We keep our Privacy Statement under regular review and it may be updated periodically. Laws, regulations, and industry standards evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or we may make changes to our services or business. We will notify you by posting an updated, date-stamped version of this Privacy Statement on our website. If we make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, we will provide notice to you in accordance with applicable law. Notice may be by posting a notice on our website, by email to you at the email address that you most recently provided to us, or by other means, consistent with applicable law. Accordingly, please keep your account information, including email address, updated.</p><h3>Your access to and use of third party websites or services accessible through the HeySummit Services</h3><p>The HeySummit Services include links to third-party websites and applications as well as to partner providers of multiple different types of services associated with a particular Event.</p><h3>Third party web sites and applications.</h3><p>Clicking on links to third party websites, content or applications may allow those third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control those third-party websites or content and are not responsible for their privacy statements or the way in which they collect or use your data.</p><p>Where you access or use third party services provided by an Event organiser, advertiser, sponsor or any other party who participates in an Event, we encourage you to request details of and read the Privacy Statement of that party. We do not control those third parties and are not responsible for their privacy statements or the way in which they collect or use your data.</p><h3><strong>1.

The information which we receive from third parties depends on what policies that third party follows and our and your respective relationships with the third party.</li></ul><h3><strong>3.

This is how we decide which services and offers may be relevant for you. Subject to applicable law, we may send you information that we think may be of interest to you.</p><p><strong>Opting out</strong></p><p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time. You can contact us or, where applicable, use the instructions located at the bottom of your email. Please note that regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by this Privacy Statement or as required by applicable law. For example, you may not opt out of certain operational communications, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you.</p><p><strong>Cookies</strong></p><p>We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve the HeySummit Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.</p><p><strong>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others</strong></p><p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the internet and to provide analytics services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the HeySummit Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.

If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p><p><strong>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</strong></p><h3>4. Disclosures of your personal data</h3><p>We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table “Purposes for which we will use your personal data” above.</p><ul><li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li><li>Third parties in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale or transfer of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Statement.</li></ul><p>Where third parties provide Events or support the provision of Services made available to you, these third parties may receive certain personal data about you. Whilst we are not in control of these third parties, we require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.</p><p>To help constantly improve and tailor the service we provide to you, we may use aggregated information so that we can administer and improve our services, analyze trends, gather broad demographic information and detect suspicious or fraudulent transactions and most importantly monitor and improve our operations on a day to day basis. In carrying out this activity, we may pass some information to third parties in aggregate and anonymized format.</p><p><strong>Your disclosure to third parties</strong></p><p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Statement, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you provide to them. HeySummit does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p><h3><strong>5. International transfers</strong></h3><p>We may transfer your personal data outside your country of residence, including the European Economic Area (EEA), in our performance of services.</p><p>Whenever we transfer personal data out of the EEA, we ensure an appropriate degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p><ul><li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</li><li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li><li>Where we use providers based in the US, we only transfer data to them under the scope of a Data Processing Agreement which incorporates Standard Contractual Clauses, or another legally applicable data transfer mechanism, which require them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.</li></ul><p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p><h3><strong>6. Data security</strong></h3><p>We have put in place commercially reasonable security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. That said, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security.</p><p><strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong></p><p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint, if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you, or as required or permitted by applicable law.</p><p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p><p><strong>If you provide personal data in connection with the submission of Event Content, we may process sensitive personal data as part of the HeySummit Services.</strong></p><p>This includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data.</p><p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.</p><p>In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p><h3>7. Your legal rights</h3><p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to:</p><ul><li><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li><li><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li><li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li><li><strong>Request restriction</strong> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</li><li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li><li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li><li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li><li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li><li><strong>Request the transfer </strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li><li><strong>Object to processing </strong>of your personal data. We will assess your request and determine whether we have any legal or other justification for continued processing. </li><li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li></ul><p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p><p><strong>No fee usually required</strong></p><p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><p><strong>Time limit to respond</strong></p><p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month or within the timeline provided by applicable law. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p><h3>8.
