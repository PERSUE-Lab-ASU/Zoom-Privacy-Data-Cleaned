The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity. Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally\n        identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you). For example, we may tie this information to personal information about you that we collect from other sources or that you provide to us. If this happens, we will treat the combined\n        information as personally identifiable information.</p>\n    <p><u>Cookies</u>: The Website uses cookies, which are small text files that, within the scope of your visit to the Website, are transmitted to your browser and are stored by your browser on your computer for later retrieval.

When you visit the Website, a request is sent to Google and Google processes the domain name and the IP address of the Website visitor\n                to dynamically return the advertising content of the Website. Google sets a cookie. The display of the advertising content is the primary purpose of the Website, and the setting of the cookie is technically necessary to provide the advertising\n                content of the Website. The advertising content is not personalized, and no profile of the Website visitor is generated. You can prevent the setting of cookies by Google by setting your browser accordingly, in particular by suppressing\n                cookies from third-party providers, and thus prevent cookies from being set. See here for further information: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/\">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.\n            </p>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><u>Choices as to Cookies and Other Automatic Tracking Technologies</u>: It may be possible to disable some (but not all) cookies or automatic data collection technologies through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality\n        of all or a portion of the Website.

You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>\n    <p><i>General Requirements</i>. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you\n        are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. It must also describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\n    </p>\n    <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require\n        you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>\n    <p><i>Response Timing and Format</i>. We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at: <a href=\"https://www.bodis.com/contact\">https://www.bodis.com/contact</a>. We endeavor to respond to\n        a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we may deliver our written\n        response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>\n    <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests,\n        we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>\n    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you\n        with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>\n    <p><u>Non-Discrimination</u>:</p>\n    <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value\n        and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>\n    <p><u>Other California Privacy Rights</u>:</p>\n    <p>California's \"Shine the Light\" law permits users of the Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
