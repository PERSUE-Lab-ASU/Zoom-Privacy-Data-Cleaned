This Privacy Policy provides you with information about how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal data collected in connection with your use of our websites, mobile applications, software solutions and other Smokeball services (collectively, the \u201c<strong>Services</strong>\u201d).</p><p>In this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise specified:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>\u201c<strong>Smokeball</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>we</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>our</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>us</strong>\u201d, and any similar terms refers to:<ul role=\"list\"><li>if you are accessing or using Smokeball Services in the United States; and</li><li>if you are accessing or using Smokeball\u2019s Services, or accessing Smokeball\u2019s U.S. websites,</li></ul></li><li>the \u201c<strong>Smokeball Group</strong>\u201d refers to Smokeball UK Limited, Smokeball Australia Pty Ltd, and Smokeball Inc, as well as any of their parent or subsidiary companies (or companies controlled by the same parent) from time to time.<strong>\u200d</strong></li></ul><p>\u200d</p><p>\u200d</p><h3><strong>3. What data does Smokeball collect?</strong></h3><p>\u200d</p><p><strong>3.1 User Data</strong>\u200d</p><p>We may collect, store, and otherwise process information about you that you provide, upload, input, or generate from your use of our Services.&nbsp;Depending on the Services you use, this may include information about your work emails, calendar, meetings and appointments, time recordings, invoices, memos, work-related documents, interactions with other colleagues and counterparties through our Services, and account passwords. We may also collect or infer certain information from your use of our Services, such as the particular Services you access, features you use, time of access, login attempts, duration of each usage session, where you access our Services from, and your Service settings, preferences, and usage habits.</p><p>\u200d</p><p><strong>3.2 Client Data</strong></p><p><strong>\u200d</strong>If you are a client of one of our customers (for example, a client receiving legal services from a law firm that is using our Services), then we may collect, store, and otherwise process information about you and your legal matter, which our customers upload or import to, or generate from, our Services.&nbsp;This data may include sensitive category data as described in section 3.3 below.Our Services may also give customers the ability to grant limited access to certain parts of the Services (including data stored on those Services, such as Client Data) to third parties. This will allow those third parties to access certain Client Data that our customers choose to share through the Services. Some examples of how our customers may use this feature to share Client Data with third parties include:</p><ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"><li>a customer may set up a virtual data room through our Service as part of a corporate acquisition, to share certain Client Data with the purchasing party and their professional advisors for the purposes of conducting due diligence;</li><li>a customer may create a shared space to share Client Data relating to legal proceedings with an external attorney; or</li><li>a customer may create a shared space to enable sharing of Client Data with relevant third parties in the context of a conveyancing transaction.</li><li>We collect, share, and otherwise process Client Data as a data processor on behalf of our customers (i.e. law firms, attorneys, and other legal professionals that use our Services). This means that in the vast majority of cases, the customer is the controller of this data and will determine how your Client Data is processed and who it is shared with. If you have any questions about our processing of Client Data, you should first speak with the law firm or legal professional that you are a client of, and that has provided us the Client Data for processing.</li></ol><p>\u200d</p><p>We only collect and process Client Data as required to provide our Services to our customers, or where required to comply with applicable law. We do not access or share Client Data stored on our servers except in the following circumstances:</p><ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"><li>where Client Data may be made temporarily visible to us when providing technical support or training to our customers, or when we are responding to a customer's questions;</li><li>where we are required or compelled by law (including by court order or subpoena) or at the direction of a government or law enforcement authority to share Client Data with another party (and in such cases, we may act as the controller of the data); or</li><li>where our customer has authorized the Client Data to be shared with a third-party.</li></ol><p>\u200d</p><p><strong>3.3 Sensitive Category Data</strong>\u200d</p><p>Sensitive category data means:</p><ol role=\"list\" start=\"3\"><li>data about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, sexual practices or orientation, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, criminal history, or physical or mental health;</li><li>your genetic or biometric data; and</li><li>any other specific categories of data that are subject to more onerous requirements under applicable data protection laws from time to time.</li><li>We do not proactively seek to collect or process sensitive category data. However, we may store, share, and otherwise process sensitive category data to the extent that this data is Client Data, as described in section 3.2 above. We describe the purposes for which we process Client Data (including where this contains sensitive category data) in sections 3.2 above.</li></ol><p>\u200d</p><p><strong>3.4 Aggregated Data</strong></p><p>We also collect and process high-level statistical and/or demographical data about how our customers interact with our Services (for example, how customers of a certain size or type like to use our Services).&nbsp;This data relates only to our customers, and cannot be used to directly or indirectly identify a specific individual user of our Services.&nbsp;As such, this data is not considered personal data and may not be subject to the same safeguards as described in this Privacy Policy.We use this aggregated data to better understand our customers, what features they use the most, to identify opportunities to improve our Services, and to determine what marketing content, guides, and publications will be of most value to our customers.</p><p>\u200d</p><p>\u200d</p><h3><strong>4.

Your PrivacyYour privacy is important to Smokeball, and we are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy provides you with information about how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal data collected in connection with your use of our websites, mobile applications, software solutions and other Smokeball services (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d).In this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise specified:\u201cSmokeball\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, and any similar terms refers to:if you are accessing or using Smokeball Services in the United States; andif you are accessing or using Smokeball\u2019s Services, or accessing Smokeball\u2019s U.S. websites,the \u201cSmokeball Group\u201d refers to Smokeball UK Limited, Smokeball Australia Pty Ltd, and Smokeball Inc, as well as any of their parent or subsidiary companies (or companies controlled by the same parent) from time to time.\u200d\u200d\u200d3. What data does Smokeball collect?\u200d3.1 User Data\u200dWe may collect, store, and otherwise process information about you that you provide, upload, input, or generate from your use of our Services.\u00a0Depending on the Services you use, this may include information about your work emails, calendar, meetings and appointments, time recordings, invoices, memos, work-related documents, interactions with other colleagues and counterparties through our Services, and account passwords. We may also collect or infer certain information from your use of our Services, such as the particular Services you access, features you use, time of access, login attempts, duration of each usage session, where you access our Services from, and your Service settings, preferences, and usage habits.\u200d3.2 Client Data\u200dIf you are a client of one of our customers (for example, a client receiving legal services from a law firm that is using our Services), then we may collect, store, and otherwise process information about you and your legal matter, which our customers upload or import to, or generate from, our Services.\u00a0This data may include sensitive category data as described in section 3.3 below.Our Services may also give customers the ability to grant limited access to certain parts of the Services (including data stored on those Services, such as Client Data) to third parties. This will allow those third parties to access certain Client Data that our customers choose to share through the Services. Some examples of how our customers may use this feature to share Client Data with third parties include:a customer may set up a virtual data room through our Service as part of a corporate acquisition, to share certain Client Data with the purchasing party and their professional advisors for the purposes of conducting due diligence;a customer may create a shared space to share Client Data relating to legal proceedings with an external attorney; ora customer may create a shared space to enable sharing of Client Data with relevant third parties in the context of a conveyancing transaction.We collect, share, and otherwise process Client Data as a data processor on behalf of our customers (i.e. law firms, attorneys, and other legal professionals that use our Services). This means that in the vast majority of cases, the customer is the controller of this data and will determine how your Client Data is processed and who it is shared with. If you have any questions about our processing of Client Data, you should first speak with the law firm or legal professional that you are a client of, and that has provided us the Client Data for processing.\u200dWe only collect and process Client Data as required to provide our Services to our customers, or where required to comply with applicable law. We do not access or share Client Data stored on our servers except in the following circumstances:where Client Data may be made temporarily visible to us when providing technical support or training to our customers, or when we are responding to a customer's questions;where we are required or compelled by law (including by court order or subpoena) or at the direction of a government or law enforcement authority to share Client Data with another party (and in such cases, we may act as the controller of the data); orwhere our customer has authorized the Client Data to be shared with a third-party.\u200d3.3 Sensitive Category Data\u200dSensitive category data means:data about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, sexual practices or orientation, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, criminal history, or physical or mental health;your genetic or biometric data; andany other specific categories of data that are subject to more onerous requirements under applicable data protection laws from time to time.We do not proactively seek to collect or process sensitive category data. However, we may store, share, and otherwise process sensitive category data to the extent that this data is Client Data, as described in section 3.2 above. We describe the purposes for which we process Client Data (including where this contains sensitive category data) in sections 3.2 above.\u200d3.4 Aggregated DataWe also collect and process high-level statistical and/or demographical data about how our customers interact with our Services (for example, how customers of a certain size or type like to use our Services).\u00a0This data relates only to our customers, and cannot be used to directly or indirectly identify a specific individual user of our Services.\u00a0As such, this data is not considered personal data and may not be subject to the same safeguards as described in this Privacy Policy.We use this aggregated data to better understand our customers, what features they use the most, to identify opportunities to improve our Services, and to determine what marketing content, guides, and publications will be of most value to our customers.\u200d\u200d4.
