<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. <strong>How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data?</strong></h2>



<p>We will not keep your personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. Your personal data will therefore be kept for the following periods (or, where there is no fixed period, the following factors will be used to determine how long it is kept):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table terms-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of Data</strong></td><td><strong>How Long We Keep It</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes billing address, delivery address, email address, and telephone numbers.</td><td>Whilst you are a customer and for two years after you are a customer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Financial Data</strong> includes bank account and payment card details.</td><td>6 years.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth, and gender.</td><td>Whilst you are a customer and for two years after you are a customer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Transaction Data</strong> includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.</td><td>6 years.<br></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Technical Data</strong> includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type, and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.</td><td>2 years.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profile Data </strong>includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback, and survey responses.&nbsp;</td><td>Whilst you are a customer and three years after you are a customer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marketing and Communications Data </strong>includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.</td><td>Whilst you are a customer and for three years after you are a customer.<br>For three years after you make an enquiry with us or register to receive marketing communications</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enquiries</strong></td><td>Whilst you make an enquiry and for 12 months after you make an enquiry</td></tr><tr><td><strong>End client data</strong></td><td>Whilst you are a customer and for six years after you are a customer<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. <strong>How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data?</strong></h2>



<p>If any personal data is transferred outside of the United Kingdom and/or the EEA, we will take suitable steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the Data Protection Legislation, as explained below.<br><br>We may store or transfer some or all of your personal data in countries that are not part of the United Kingdom and/or EEA. These are known as “third countries” and may not have data protection laws that are as strong as those in the UK and/or the EEA. This means that we will take additional steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and EEA under the Data Protection Legislation as follows:<br><br>We use specific contracts with external third parties that are approved by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data to third countries. These contracts require the same levels of personal data protection that would apply under the Data Protection Legislation. More information is available from the European Commission and the Information Commissioners Office in the UK.<br><br>The security of your personal data is essential to us, and to protect your data, we take a number of important measures, including the following:<br> – limiting access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties with a legitimate need to know and ensuring that they are subject to duties of confidentiality;<br> – procedures for dealing with data breaches (the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, your personal data) including notifying you and/or the Information Commissioner’s Office where we are legally required to do so.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. <strong>Do You Share My Personal Data?</strong></h2>



<p>We will not share any of your personal data with any third parties for any purposes, subject to the following exceptions:<br><br>If we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or assets, your personal data may be transferred to a third party. Any new owner of our business may continue to use your personal data in the same way(s) that we have used it, as specified in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.<br><br>We may share your personal data with our third party service providers who provide various services to us which involve data processing (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of Our Site, or provide marketing or hosting services to us) or who otherwise process personal data for purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy or notified to you when we collect your personal data.</p>



<p>If any of your personal data is shared with a third party, as described above, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data is handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the third party’s obligations under the law, as described above in Part 8.<br><br>If we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or assets, your personal data may be transferred to a third party. Any new owner of our business may continue to use your personal data in the same way(s) that we have used it, as specified in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12. <strong>How Can I Access My Personal Data?</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.<br><br>All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part 12.<br><br>There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.<br><br>We will respond to your subject access request within one month and, in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.</p>
