Cookies are small files that are created by your browser and stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you use our services. The Cookies used do not cause any damage to your end device and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other malware. In the cookie, information is stored that arises in each case in connection with the specific end device used. This does not mean, however, that we gain direct knowledge of your identity. The use of cookies serves on the one hand to make the use of our offer more pleasant for you. We use so-called session cookies to recognize that you have already visited individual pages of our website or that you have already logged in with your user account. If you use our offer again at a later time, the cookie automatically recognizes that you have already been with us and which entries and settings you have made so that you do not have to enter them again. In addition, we also use temporary cookies for the purpose of user-friendliness. These are automatically deleted after you leave our website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already have a user account and are logged in, the information stored in the cookies will be assigned to your user account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, we use cookies to statistically record and analyze the use of our offers and to evaluate them for the purpose of optimizing them for you, as well as to display information tailored specifically to you, such as current job offers. These cookies enable us to automatically recognize when you visit our site again that you have already been with us or whether you have come to us via a job advertisement placed by us with third-party providers. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined period of time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without your explicit consent, we do not use cookies beyond what is necessary for the optimal display and functionality of our site.

The storage period of the cookies depends on their purpose and is not the same for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.5.2 Google Analytics</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purpose of demand-oriented design and continuous optimization of our platform, we use based on Art. 6 (1) lit. a) GDPR in conjunction with \u00a7 25 Abs.1 S.1 TTDSG the analysis service Google Analytics of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\u201cGoogle\u201d).

This information may also be transferred to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on our behalf. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other Google data. The IP addresses are anonymized so that an assignment is not possible (so-called IP masking). You can prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of our offer (including your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google and object to further processing via the cookie by downloading <a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de\">this browser add-on. </a>You can object to the use of the cookie at any time with effect for the future by <a href=\"https://join.com/toggleCookie/\">clicking here</a>.

Microsoft sets a cookie on your device if you have accessed our website via a Microsoft Bing ad.

Microsoft collects, processes and uses information via the cookie, from which usage profiles are created using pseudonyms. These usage profiles are used to analyze visitor behavior and are used to display advertisements. No personal information about the identity of the user is processed.

This allows us to identify frequently used features of our platform and further improve it. Hotjar uses a cookie to analyze our platform in terms of user behavior. The lifetime of these cookies is one year. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our platform like&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mouse movements and clicks,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shortened IP address,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>device used, especially screen size</li>\n\n\n\n<li>operating system used,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Browser type/version,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Referrer URL (the previously visited page),</li>\n\n\n\n<li>geographical origin,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Resolution and type of device,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Time of the server request,&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>are transferred to a server of Hotjar and stored there. However, your IP address is shortened before the usage statistics are analyzed, so that no conclusions can be drawn about your identity.

This pixel is integrated into the code of our platform. On the one hand, this allows us to ensure that the Facebook ads we initiate are only displayed to those Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our offer. In this way, we want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the respective user and do not annoy him. On the other hand, this allows us to track the actions of Facebook users after they have seen or clicked on one of our Facebook ads. This helps us measure the conversion of the respective campaign for statistical, market research and billing purposes. The following information is processed during the deployment:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Timestamp,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>URL,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>campaign-related information (especially specification of the impression, form field, activated button).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The data collected in this way is anonymous for us and therefore does not allow us to draw any conclusions about the identity of the respective user. If you log into your Facebook account after activating the pixel or if you visit our website while logged in, it is possible that this data will be stored and processed by Facebook, which we would like to inform you about here. Facebook may link this data to your Facebook account and also use it for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook\u2019s data usage policy: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/\">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.

The procedure is called Google Single-Sign-In (SSO) and is operated by Google Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. This data processing serves the purpose of facilitating registration or logging in to our platform and then using our services.

For this purpose, the referrer enters master data in the mask provided for the recommendation and is then sent a link which he can share with interested parties for the purpose of recommendation. The recommendation is transmitted by Cello, whereby the referrer\u2019s e-mail address, name and IP address are processed, and the e-mail address and IP address of the referrer (the recommended person). If the referrer accepts the recommendation, he receives a reward for the recommendation, which is sent by Cello. Here, the generated revenue is processed.\n\n\n\nWe have concluded a contract with Cello on commissioned processing in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR, in which Cello undertakes to process the data received only in accordance with our instructions and to comply with the EU level of data protection.\n\n\n\nThe processing of the aforementioned data is carried out via the servers in Cello on a voluntary basis and with the consent of the parties involved.

In addition, we use your personal data to promote and develop our business relationship with you, to identify services that may be of interest to you, to carry out business development activities, to send you publications and communications or to invite you to events.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe legal basis for the purposes described above is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR, provided that your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms do not prevail. You can object to this data processing at any time. To do so, please use the contact options of our data protection officer in section 2 (\u201cWho is responsible for processing your personal data and how can you contact us?\u201d) of this privacy policy. If your consent is required for the data processing described here in section 3.6 (\u201cFurther processing\u201d) in accordance with Art. 6 (1) a) or Art. 9 (2) a) GDPR, we will obtain this explicitly from you when collecting your personal data. In addition, we process your personal data if we have a legal obligation to do so (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c) GDPR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith whom do we share your personal data?\n\n\n\n\nWhere necessary or appropriate for our services or to fulfill the purposes defined in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose to third parties (such as service providers, consultants, related parties, courts, authorities and others) in Switzerland, the EU or other countries your personal data that we collect, for example, in the course of providing our services, when you contact us or when you visit our site.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn addition, we work with third parties who provide services to us and may share your personal information with those third parties in connection with the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, for example, banks, CRM tool providers, payment processing service providers, or IT providers who may have access to your personal information at our direction or in software support.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDetailed information about the service providers we use in connection with user and customer support (see section 3.4, \u201cUser and customer support\u201d) as well as our online presence and website optimization (see section 3.5, \u201cOnline presence and website optimization\u201d) can be found in the corresponding sections of this privacy policy.\n\n\n\nWe may also disclose your personal information to third parties if:\n\n\n\n\nYou have given your consent to do so, where required, or the organization for which you work has received your consent to do so, where required;\n\n\n\nwe are required to do so by legal, regulatory or business obligations;\n\n\n\nthis is necessary in connection with a company sale, merger, restructuring, dissolution or similar events, as well as in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar events;\n\n\n\nthis is necessary in connection with legal proceedings, or to assert or defend claims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the recipients of your personal data located outside of Switzerland or the EU?\n\n\n\n\nWe may also transfer your personal data to recipients located outside of Switzerland, the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) or the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d). This applies in particular to the aforementioned processing to analysis or targeting technologies, which may result in a transfer of data to the servers of the service providers. Other recipients may be affiliated service providers that we need to provide our services, e.g. hosters, CRM tools, analytics service providers, job posting portals for multi-posting or tendering companies. These servers may be located outside of Switzerland, the EU or the EEA, in particular in the USA.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe take great care to ensure that our service providers and other recipients of your data meet data protection standards that are equivalent to those of the DPA and the GDPR and that the applicable guidelines are adhered to. For example, we only transfer your data to recipients that are located in a country that has been recognized by the competent authority (in Switzerland, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (or the Federal Council) and in the EU, the European Commission) as a country with adequate data protection. If a recipient is located in a country that is not recognized as adequate, such as the U.S., we take further protective measures in accordance with applicable data protection laws or have these recipients provide us with appropriate contractual guarantees that ensure compliance with these Swiss and EU standards and the enforcement of data subject rights, for example, based on so-called standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or the FDPIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow long do we keep your personal data?\n\n\n\n\nIn principle, your personal data will only be processed and stored by us for as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected (see in detail section 3, \u201cWhy and on what legal basis do we process your personal data and with whom do we share it?\u201d) or we are legally obliged to do so.\n\n\n\nTherefore, unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, among other things:\n\n\n\n\nPersonal data processed for the purpose of fulfilling a contract concluded between JOIN and you will be stored at least until the complete fulfillment of this contract.\n\n\n\nPersonal data processed to safeguard the legitimate interests of JOIN (e.g. as part of the provision of our site, for user and customer support, for the further development of our offer, etc.) will be retained for as long as is necessary to fulfill these purposes.\n\n\n\nIn addition, JOIN is permitted to store personal data for a longer period of time if you have consented, as long as the consent is not revoked, or if this is necessary to fulfill a legal (storage) obligation (for example, accounting regulations or tax law) or by order of an authority or in the context of a procedure.\n\n\n\n\nAfter expiration of the retention period (usually six to ten years after the end of the contract), your personal data will be deleted, unless JOIN has a legitimate interest to keep your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat rights do you have in relation to your personal data?\n\n\n\n\n7.1 Overview\n\n\n\nYou may exercise various rights with respect to your data processed by JOIN.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, you have the right to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nReceive information regarding the processed data. You have the right to know whether data is processed by JOIN, to receive information about individual aspects of the processing and to receive a copy of the data.\n\n\n\nIn the case of transfers of your data abroad, the right of access or reference to the appropriate or adequate safeguards and how to obtain a copy of them or where they are available,\n\n\n\nVerify and have it corrected. You have the right to verify the accuracy of your data and request that it be updated or corrected.\n\n\n\nRequest restriction of processing. You have the right to restrict the processing of your data under certain circumstances.\n\n\n\nRequest deletion or other removal of the personal data. You have the right to request the deletion of your data under certain circumstances.\n\n\n\nYou have the right to receive your data and have it transferred to another person responsible. You have the right to receive your data in a structured, common and machine-readable format and, if technically possible, to have it transferred to another controller without hindrance.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have consented to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose, you may withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. If you inform us that you withdraw your consent, we will no longer process your personal data for these specific purposes, unless there is another legitimate interest.\n\n\n\nYou can exercise your rights by e-mail in accordance with section 2 (\u201cWho is responsible for processing your personal data and how can you contact us?\u201d) of this Privacy Policy directly to our Data Protection Officer. We have the right, in such a case, to request information from you to verify your identity. Please note that the granting of these rights may be denied or limited in part for legal reasons or based on applicable data protection laws. We will inform you of the reasons for our decision if legally required or permitted.\n\n\n\nIf you are of the opinion that we have not handled your request or concern to your satisfaction, or that we are not processing your personal data in a data protection compliant manner, you can also contact the competent supervisory authority (so-called right of complaint); in Switzerland, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.\n\n\n\n7.2 Right of objection\n\n\n\nThe general right to object applies to all processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy that are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Unlike the specific right of objection directed at data processing for promotional purposes (compare above), we are only obliged under the GDPR to implement such a general objection if you provide us with reasons of overriding importance for doing so (e.g. a possible risk to life or health). However, we may continue to process your personal data if we can demonstrate a legitimate interest that outweighs your interests, fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights.\n\n\n\nIn addition, it is possible to contact the supervisory authority responsible for this case, the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Friedrichstrasse 219, 10969 Berlin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\n\n\n\nWe use the highest standards of information security for our infrastructure and the processing of your data. For example, we use protective mechanisms for computers, such as firewalls and data encryption. Physical access controls apply to our buildings and data. Access to our customers\u2019 personal data is restricted to those employees who need it to perform their jobs.\n\n\n\nAll data transmitted by you personally, including your payment data, will also be transmitted using the generally accepted and secure standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer). SSL is a secure and proven standard that is also used, for example, in online banking. You can recognize a secure SSL connection by the s appended to http (i.e. https://\u2026) in the address bar of your browser or by the lock symbol in the lower area of the browser.\n\n\n\nWe also use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data stored with us against manipulation, partial or complete loss and against unauthorized access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously monitored in accordance with technological developments, regularly adapted to the respective risk and improved if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy update\n\n\n\n\nWe reserve the right to update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the way we process your personal data or changes in legal requirements.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny changes we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on our website. Please check regularly for updates or changes to our privacy policy.\n", "length": 62770, "excerpt": "Read the Privacy Policy of JOIN Solutions AG - The protection of your personal data is always our top priority.", "siteName": "JOIN", "applied": false}
