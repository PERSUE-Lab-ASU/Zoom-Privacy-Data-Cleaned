    <h3>For All Consumers</h3>
    <p>
      Regardless of your location and jurisdiction, Achievers may at its sole
      discretion choose to extend these rights to all individuals, and to comply
      with reasonable requests in the manner detailed below. We do not charge for
      these services. Where you are entitled to exercise a right, we will respond
      to your request within the timeframe set out by applicable law (for EU
      residents this is typically thirty (30) days, for California residents this

      basis, we will provide a response within a reasonable timeframe.
    </p>
  
    <h2>ACCESS, CORRECTION, PORTABILITY, AND DELETION</h2>
  
    <p>
      You have the right to access, correct (“rectify”), or delete your Personal
      Information held by us or may ask for a restriction of processing. You may
      also have the right to ask for an overview or copy of your Personal
      Information or to request that certain of your personal information be
      provided to you or to another provider in a machine-readable format where
      technically feasible (data portability).
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You can exercise these rights by sending an email to
      <a href="mailto:Privacy.Office@Achievers.com">Privacy.Office@Achievers.com</a>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Except in limited circumstances, as specifically provided by applicable
      privacy legislation, Achievers can tell you whether we hold Personal
      Information about you.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Please note that there are some limitations to these rights. For example, we
      will not be able to delete your personal information if we are required by
      law to keep it or if we hold it in connection with a contract with you.
      Similarly, access to your personal information may be refused if making the
      information available would reveal personal information about another person
      or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Achievers will only refuse access to your Personal Information in those
      circumstances permitted and required by applicable laws or regulations. If
      we cannot fulfill your request, we will inform you about why we cannot
      comply with your request.
    </p>
  
    <h2>WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT</h2>
  
    <p>
      Where we process your personal information based on your consent, you have
      the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the
      lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Applicable
      law may also give you the right to object to certain elements of our
      processing or to lodge a complaint.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Object to Processing</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to object to processing (including profiling) based on
      legitimate interest grounds, where we are relying upon legitimate interests
      to process personal information. If you object, we must stop that processing
      unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing
      that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need to process the
      personal information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
      claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing, we
      believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we
      will consider each case on an individual basis.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Object to Marketing</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to object to our use of your personal information
      (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use
      your personal information to invite you to our promotional events.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority, if
      you consider that the processing of your personal information infringes
      applicable law.
    </p>
  
    <h2>ENFORCEMENT</h2>
  
    <p>
      Achievers will conduct periodic assessments to validate its continued
      adherence to this Notice.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Where Achievers has knowledge that one of Achievers employees or Service
      Providers is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary
      to this Notice, Achievers will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the
      use or disclosure. Achievers holds its employees and Service Providers
      accountable for maintaining the trust that employers and users place in our
      company.
    </p>
  
    <h2>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h2>
  
    <p>
      The personal information we collect from you may be transferred to, stored
      at or processed in other countries, including the United States or other
      locations outside the European Economic Area, which may not provide
      equivalent levels of data protection to your home jurisdiction.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an
      adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it,
      including through appropriate written data processing terms and/or data
      transfer agreements. For transfers from the EU, United Kingdom (“UK”) or
      Switzerland to the US, Achievers relies on adequacy decisions by the EU
      Commission or putting in place standard contractual clauses as approved by
      the European Commission (the form for the standard contractual clauses can
      be found here:
      <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses</a>)
      or another applicable supervisory body.
    </p>
  
    <h2>PRIVACY SHIELD</h2>
  
    <p>
      Achievers, through its US affiliate Achievers LLC, complies with the EU-US
      Privacy Shield Framework (“EU Privacy Shield”) and the Swiss-US Privacy
      Shield Framework (“Swiss Privacy Shield”) as set forth by the US Department
      of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
      information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom (“UK”)
      and Switzerland to the United States.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      As part of the certification made via its prior affiliate, Blackhawk Network
      Inc., Achievers has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres
      to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. If there
      is any conflict between the terms in this Notice and the Privacy Shield
      Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about
      the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit:
      <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Prior to July 16, 2020, Achievers relied on its EU Privacy Shield and Swiss
      Privacy Shield certifications as one means of demonstrating adequacy and
      safeguarding transfers of data from the EU and Switzerland. In addition to
      Privacy Shield, Achievers also executed Standard Contractual Clauses with
      entities involved in such data transfers. As of July 16, 2020, Achievers
      will primarily rely on country-level adequacy decisions or the Standard
      Contractual Clauses for EU, UK, and Swiss transfers. For transfers occurring
      prior to July 16, 2020, Achievers will continue to be responsible for the
      processing of EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Information under the EU Privacy
      Shield Framework and will maintain full compliance with the requirements of
      that framework until further notice. Subsequent transfers of EU, UK, and
      Swiss Personal Information to any third-party acting as an agent on our
      behalf occurring after July 16, 2020, will be under the terms of the EU
      Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      With respect to Personal Information received or transferred pursuant to the
      EU or Swiss Privacy Shield Framework, Achievers is and will continue to be
      subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade
      Commission until further notice.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In certain situations, Achievers may be required to disclose Personal
      Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including
      to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. To the best of
      our knowledge, Achievers’ systems are not subject to routine access by
      government authorities without warrants or appropriate accountability via
      established legal process.
    </p>

      procedures have been exhausted.
    </p>
  
    <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
