We will support customers who run Corezoid Actor Engine products on supported Operating Systems, irrespective of whether they are running in VMware environments or not. We support Operating Systems, not specific hardware configurations. Accordingly, VMware operates as a hardware abstraction layer. VMware supports a set of certified Operating Systems and Hardware, and the customer and VMware will be responsible for any interactions or issues that arise at the Hardware or Operating System layer as a result of their use of VMware.</span></p></div><div><p><span>We will not require You to recreate and troubleshoot every issue in a non-VMware environment; however, We do reserve the right to request You to diagnose certain issues in a native certified Operating System environment, operating without the virtual environment. We will only make this request when there is reason to believe that the virtual environment is a contributing factor to the issue.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Any time spent on investigation of problems that may, in our sole opinion, be related to VMware, will be handled in the following fashion:</span></p><p><span>1. </span><span>We will provide standard support to all Corezoid Actor Engine products.</span></p><p><span>2. </span><span>If a problem is encountered while Corezoid Actor Engine is/are running in a VMware environment, You may be required to recreate the problem on a non-VMware server unit, at which time we will provide regular support.</span></p><p><span>3. </span><span>You can authorize Us to investigate the VMware related items at normal time and materials rates. If such investigation shows that the problem is VMware related, You may contract Us to provide a software change to resolve the issue if such a resolution is possible.</span></p><p><span>4. </span><span>Regardless of the problem type or source, if the problem is determined to be a non VMware related issue - time spent on investigation and resolution will be covered as part of regular maintenance, and support will be provided as usual.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Amazon Linux 2 is a supported OS for Corezoid Actor Engine. You will receive the same support on Amazon Linux 2 as they would on any other certified operating systems.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>", "textContent": "COREZOID CUSTOMER AGREEMENTLast update: June 28, 2022BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO FOLLOW ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

We will support customers who run Corezoid Actor Engine products on supported Operating Systems, irrespective of whether they are running in VMware environments or not. We support Operating Systems, not specific hardware configurations. Accordingly, VMware operates as a hardware abstraction layer. VMware supports a set of certified Operating Systems and Hardware, and the customer and VMware will be responsible for any interactions or issues that arise at the Hardware or Operating System layer as a result of their use of VMware.We will not require You to recreate and troubleshoot every issue in a non-VMware environment; however, We do reserve the right to request You to diagnose certain issues in a native certified Operating System environment, operating without the virtual environment. We will only make this request when there is reason to believe that the virtual environment is a contributing factor to the issue.Any time spent on investigation of problems that may, in our sole opinion, be related to VMware, will be handled in the following fashion:1. We will provide standard support to all Corezoid Actor Engine products.2. If a problem is encountered while Corezoid Actor Engine is/are running in a VMware environment, You may be required to recreate the problem on a non-VMware server unit, at which time we will provide regular support.3. You can authorize Us to investigate the VMware related items at normal time and materials rates. If such investigation shows that the problem is VMware related, You may contract Us to provide a software change to resolve the issue if such a resolution is possible.4. Regardless of the problem type or source, if the problem is determined to be a non VMware related issue - time spent on investigation and resolution will be covered as part of regular maintenance, and support will be provided as usual.Amazon Linux 2 is a supported OS for Corezoid Actor Engine. You will receive the same support on Amazon Linux 2 as they would on any other certified operating systems.", "length": 23540, "excerpt": "Learn more about terms and conditions of Corezoid.com", "siteName": "Corezoid", "applied": false}
