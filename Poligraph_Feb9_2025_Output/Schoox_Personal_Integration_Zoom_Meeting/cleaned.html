Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under DPF, should direct their query to <a href="mailto:privacy@schoox.com">privacy@schoox.com</a>. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
