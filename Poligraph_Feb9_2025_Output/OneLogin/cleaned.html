References to Quest in this policy document should be read to include One Identity unless the context requires otherwise.</p><p>This privacy policy (<strong>“Privacy Policy”</strong>) is applicable to the quest.com and oneidentity.com websites and any other websites owned and operated by Quest Software Inc. (<strong>“Quest”</strong>), 20 Enterprise, Suite 100, Aliso Viejo CA 92656, US, and its subsidiaries or affiliates (referred to as <strong>“this Website,” “We”, “our” or “us”</strong>). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the websites of our customers or Business Partners or to the websites of any other third parties, even if we have links to their websites on our website.</p><p>If you would like to view this Privacy Policy by country, <a href="/legal/privacy-policy-by-country.aspx"> please click here.</a></p><p>This Privacy Policy governs information we collect from you when you use any of our products or this Website. This Policy also outlines our specific practices related to collection, use, processing, transfer and/or storage of Personal Data (as defined below) in connection with your purchase, access and use of our SaaS software applications.</p><p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>"Business Partners"</strong>
					are subcontractors, vendors distributors, resellers and other entities with whom we have ongoing business relationships to provide products, services and information to our customers. “Affiliates” are legal entities that are owned by or under direct common ownership with Quest. "Personal Data" means information that can directly or indirectly identify you as an individual, such as your name, telephone number, address, billing information and email address or other similar information.</p><p>When you use our Website, we may seek your explicit consent to process Personal Data we collect or that you voluntarily provide. In case you do not grant the requested consent for the processing of your Personal Data or if you later inform Quest (in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below) that you do not want Quest to further process your Personal Data, any further use of certain offerings or services of Quest may be either prevented or limited in scope.</p><p><strong>When do we collect Personal Data?</strong></p><p>We may ask you to provide your Personal Data when you:</p><ul><li>Use This Website;</li><li>Register for an account on This Website;</li><li>Purchase a SaaS product or Service from This Website;</li><li>Use one or more of our SaaS (software-as-a-service) offerings;</li><li>Register products you have purchased from us;</li><li>Obtain a software trial or update;</li><li>Contact us, including for sales, professional services or technical

For example, when someone subscribes to an online product or service, we collect that person’s (<strong>“Subscriber’s”</strong>) first and last name as well as their company’s name, email, and phone number. Once registration is complete, we collect similar information from the person designated by the Subscriber as the designated administrator for the subscription. That administrator may share additional end user information to enable Subscriber’s end users to use the subscribed service. In all of this, however, it is the Subscriber who is responsible for notifying their end users that their information may be collected and shared with Quest as part of their use of the Service.</p><p>When you visit this Website Quest uses session <strong>“cookies”</strong>
					– – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Website to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable Quest to process your online transactions. Please see the “<strong>Use
						of Cookies</strong>” section for further information.</p><p><strong>Mobile:</strong> When you download and use Quest services (including SaaS services) we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, the frequency of usage, application version, operating system version, the time it been used, and the device location.</p><p><strong>Recruiting and hiring:</strong> We process your Personal Data, such as contact, job applicant data and biographical data, to assess your application and to evaluate and improve our recruitment system, our application tracking and our recruitment activities. You may also provide us with sensitive information like your Social Security Number or government identifier and other Personal Data in connection with your job application. We may use your Personal Data to communicate with you regarding your application for employment in connection with opportunities at Quest that appear over time that we believe may be of interest to you. We also use your Personal Data to send you new hire and employee experience information. We may verify your information, including through reference checks and, where allowed, background checks. Quest and our third-party utility-tracking partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.</p><p><strong>How We Use Personal Data</strong></p><p>We use your Personal Data to:</p><ul><li>Deliver the products and support or carry out the transactions you

These communications may include requests relating to our products or services, including SaaS services. As an example, we may share Personal Data to a payment processor who will bill you for services or an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. In these (and other similar) instances, we will only share Personal Data with Business Partners who share our commitment of protecting your Personal Data and who have agreed in writing to provide protection to your Personal Data that is both in compliance with legal requirements and commensurate with the protections we ourselves provide. We will not disclose Personal Data to third parties for their own marketing purposes in absence of your consent.</p><p>Except as described in this Policy, Quest will not give, sell, rent, share or loan any personal information to any third party other than as outlined in this Policy.

This “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings.

Similarly, third parties whose content or advertisements appear on this Website may also place web beacons in their ads or emails for the purposes of measuring the effectiveness of the content, advertisements or email messages.</p><p>A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email message. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of this Website and our advertising in various ways. For example, web beacons may count the number of individuals who visit this Website from a particular advertisement or who make a purchase from this Website after viewing a particular advertisement or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons may also measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message, determining when an email message is opened and determining how many times an email message is forwarded.</p><p>The information we collect through web beacons may include some limited Personal Data, and web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing our cookies. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other information we have collected from you. We use all this information to better tailor our marketing communications to you, and we may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customize content on this Website and undertake internal research.</p><p>We prohibit web beacons on this Website from being used by third parties to access Personal Data. We may allow Business Partners to compile individual information or aggregated (anonymous) statistics from the use of web beacons on this Website to determine the effectiveness of online marketing and to develop statistics related to purchase activity or any other action on the advertiser’s site. Aggregate information may include demographic and usage information, but no Personal Data about you is shared with Business Partners for this research.</p><p>You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies in your web browser and you can always change your preferences in the <a href="https://preferences.quest.com/privacy">Cookie Preference Center</a>, also available from our home page as <a href="https://preferences.quest.com/privacy">“Your Privacy Choices”</a>.</p><p><strong>How We Use Pixel Tracking</strong> </p><p>Similar to Cookies, this Website and some of our Business Partners use
