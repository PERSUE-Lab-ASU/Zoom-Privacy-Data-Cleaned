If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request\u2019s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.</p> <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p> <p><strong>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</strong></p> <p>As LeanData does not sell any personal information, no opt-out is needed.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;Non-Discrimination</strong></p> <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
