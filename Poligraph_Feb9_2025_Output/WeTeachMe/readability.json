For fundraising pages, we may provide your personal data both to the organiser of the fundraising page and the vendor of the class to which the fundraising page is linked. In some instances, a vendor may appoint a third party, which may or may not be affiliated with the vendor, to create an event or fundraising page on its behalf (we call these third parties (\"third party organisers\"). For example, and without limitation, a coffee school (the vendor, in this case) may allow third party promoters or supply companies companies (the third party organisers) to create events that will be hosted at the vendor's venue using its WeTeachMe account. In that case, we may provide your personal data to the third party organisers on behalf of the vendors. We are not responsible for the actions of these vendors, or their third party organisers, with respect to your personal data. It is important that you review the applicable policies of the vendor, and if applicable and available, their appointed third party organisers, of a class (and the related fundraising page, if applicable) before providing personal data or other information in connection with that class or related fundraising page.

After this period, we will securely delete or anonymize your data in accordance with our standard data retention and deletion protocols.</p><p><em><strong>Disclosure of personal information outside Australia</strong></em></p><p>3.16 &nbsp;We may disclose personal information to third party suppliers that are located outside of Australia including in the USA, UK, Hong Kong, the Philippines and the EU.</p><p>3.17 &nbsp;When you provide your personal information to us, you consent to the disclosure of your information outside of Australia and acknowledge that we are not required to ensure that overseas recipients handle that personal information in compliance with Australian Privacy Law (and where appropriate the GDPR).

Instead of paying for a month of classes in advance, you may request to be billed for these classes on a fortnightly basis. Your request to be billed in this way is a request for periodic purchase transactions.</em></p><p>3.22 &nbsp;All transactions are processed over an industry standard SSL/TLS connection, with a minimum of 128-bit encryption. All transactions are encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (<strong>PCI-DSS</strong>).</p><p>3.23 &nbsp;All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.</p><p>3.24&nbsp; PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our website and its service providers.</p><p><strong>4. Security of Your Personal Information</strong></p><p>4.1 &nbsp;We may hold your personal information in either electronic or hard copy form.</p><p>4.2 &nbsp;We take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold against loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure and against other misuse and we use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your personal information. However, we do not guarantee the security of your personal information.</p><p><strong>5.
