This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://smoothbook.co">https://smoothbook.co</a> (hereinafter, “us”, “we”, or “https://smoothbook.co”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website.

<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Yellow Melon Ltd. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Yellow Melon Ltd.’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Yellow Melon Ltd.’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Yellow Melon Ltd. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Yellow Melon Ltd. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://smoothbook.co blog posts.
