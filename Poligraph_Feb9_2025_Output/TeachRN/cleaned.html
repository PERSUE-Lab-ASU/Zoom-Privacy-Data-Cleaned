      <div><h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy tells you TeachRN LLC. (“TeachRN”) policies and procedures for the collection, use, and disclosure of information through www.teachrn.com  (“Site”). It includes websites, features, applications, widgets, or online services owned or controlled by TeachRN and that post a link to this Privacy Policy (together with the Site, the “Service”). It also includes any information TeachRN collects offline in connection with the Service.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the choices available to you for the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.  Note that we combine the information we collect from you from the Site, through the Service generally, or offline.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed to your satisfaction, please contact our Support team at Support@teachrn.com.</p>
<p>Certain features or services referenced in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on the Service at all times. Please also review our Terms of Service, which governs your use of the Service, and which is accessible at TeachRN Terms.</p>
<p>We’ve provided short summaries in this Privacy Policy (in italics throughout) to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices or rights you may have. While these summaries help explain some of these concepts in a simple and clear way, we encourage you to read the entire Privacy Policy to understand our data practices.</p>
<h2 id="1-information-collection">1. INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>
<p>Users of the Service may be Clients, Freelancers, or Agencies, or Site Visitors (as each is defined in the User Agreement).</p>
<h3 id="information-you-provide-to-us">Information You Provide to Us</h3>
<p>When you use the Service, you may provide us with information about you. This may include your name and contact information, financial information to make or receive payment for services obtained through the TeachRN platform, or information to help us fill out tax forms. When you use the Service, we may also collect information related to your use of the Service and aggregate this with information about other users. This helps us improve our Services for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Information: While using the Service (whether as a Client or Freelancer), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, company address, billing address, and phone number.</li>
<li>Payment Information: If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect certain payment information, such as credit card or other financial account information, and billing address.</li>
<li>Identity Verification: We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth or taxpayer identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete tax filings. We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification or photo or a billing statement.</li>
<li>Biometric Identifiers or Service Interaction Information: We may collect Personal Information to verify your identity and to detect fraud, identity theft, or other misuse of your account through facial recognition and other technologies. This might be a photograph of your face, a selfie, or data about your interactions with the Service. We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued ID. From time to time, TeachRN may require you to take and submit another or updated image of your face for comparison to your government-issued ID. The biometric identifiers or information collected are used only to verify your identity and platform security and use integrity purposes.</li>
<li>General Audience Service: The Service is general audience and intended for users 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone younger than age 18. If we become aware that a child younger than 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child younger than age 18 and believe that TeachRN has collected Personal Information from your child, please contact us at: Hello@teachrn.com</li>
<li>Non-Identifying Information/Usernames: We also may collect other information, such as zip codes, demographic data, information about your use of the Service, and general project-related data (“Non-Identifying Information”). We may combine information collected from TeachRN users, whether they are registered or not (“TeachRN Users”). In some cases, we may render Personal Information (generally, email address) into a form of Non-Identifying Information referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Hashed Information.” This is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code. The code does not identify you directly, but it may be used to connect your activity and interests.</li>
<li>Once a transaction occurs between a freelancer and a client, the first name and last initial will be disclosed for identification and communication purposes.</li>
<li>Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information: Sometimes when non-identifying information is combined, it can identify an individual. For example, if a birthdate is combined with a first name, it might identify a person even if the birthday or first name alone could not. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information, but TeachRN will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</li>
<li>Collection of Third-Party Personal Information: We collect the following personal information from you: First name, last name, and email address when you provide it to us for the purpose of adding your contacts to a service project communication board and SMS reminders.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not have a statutory obligation to provide us with any information, but you may have a contractual obligation to do so, and if we do not receive certain information from you, then we will not be able to provide our Service to you. If you have any questions regarding whether provision of information is mandatory and the consequences for withholding such information, please contact us using the contact information below.</p>
<h3 id="information-received-from-third-parties">Information Received from Third Parties</h3>
<p>Third parties may also give us information about you. If we combine that information with information about you collected through the Service, we will still treat that combined information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records, or third parties may provide information in connection with a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a third-party service). If we combine the information, we receive from others with information we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 id="information-collected-automatically">Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<p>Like other online companies, we receive technical information when you use our Services. We use these technologies to analyze how people use the Service, to improve how our Site functions, to save your log-in information for future sessions, and to serve you with advertisements that may interest you.</p>
<p>We and our third-party service providers, including analytics and third party content providers, may automatically collect certain information from you whenever you access or interact with the Service. This information may include, among other information, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to the Service, areas within the Service that you visited, which links you clicked on, which pages or content you viewed and for how long, other similar information and statistics about your interactions, such as content response times, download errors and length of visits to certain pages and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate with websites. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.</p>
<p>TeachRN use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movement around the website, the desktop app, and the mobile app, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. The technology used to collect information automatically from TeachRN Users may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies: Like many websites, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device (such as to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service and to track your compliance with the TeachRN Terms of Service) and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session (for example, to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how TeachRN Users interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by TeachRN Users and web traffic routing on the Service). You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functionality of the Service. For further information on cookies and how they are used for the Service, please visit our Cookie Policy.</li>
<li>Web Beacons: We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” and/or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Service is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Service, to monitor how TeachRN Users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</li>
<li>Embedded Scripts: We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as an Embedded Script. An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-we-respond-to-do-not-track-signals">HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h3>
<p>TeachRN does not respond to Do-Not-Track signals.</p>
<p>Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, TeachRN does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com .</p>
<h3 id="the-general-data-protection-regulation-data-processing-agreement">The General Data Protection Regulation: Data Processing Agreement</h3>
<p>To streamline compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), TeachRN has posted a <a href="https://vault.pactsafe.io/s/f89b37df-42d9-4971-bbcc-466469a68600/legal.html#contract-hkc-19e1q">Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”)</a> governing the relationship between the Customer (as defined in the DPA) acting as a data controller or processor, as applicable (and as defined in the DPA), of personal data under European Data Protection Legislation; and TeachRN (acting as a data processor or subprocessor, as applicable).</p>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by you and TeachRN, to the extent TeachRN processes any EU personal data for you as a controller (as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679) in your role as a Customer, the Data Processing Agreement applies.</p>
<h3 id="service-project-communication-board-and-sms-reminders">Service Project Communication Board and SMS Reminders</h3>
<p>We collect information about a Freelancer’s work for a Client, including automatically collected information about work on a particular project. If a Freelancer uses the commenting system, we will share messages, downloads and SMS text reminders with the relevant Client.</p>
<p>As part of the Service, we collect information about a Freelancer’s work on a project for a Client. This feature is known as Comments. Comments includes information provided by the Freelancer, such as a memo, as well documents and resources needed to work on a project. Comments will also send SMS reminders for Live one on one or group meetings booked within TeachRN.</p>
<p>We will share information contained in comments with the relevant Client and with any manager or administrator of any applicable TeachRN Support Team.</p>
<h3 id="user-profiles">User Profiles</h3>
<p>Freelancers may create a profile, with certain or all information publicly available. Clients may also create user profiles.</p>
<p>You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, and may include Personal Information, photographs, examples of your work, information on work previously performed via the Service and outside the Service, skills, tests taken, test scores, cost of services and feedback/rating information and other information, including your username (“Profile”). The information in your Profile may be visible to all TeachRN Users and the general public subject to the privacy choices you make within your TeachRN Profile. If you choose to make your profile publicly visible, your profile will be visible to the entire Internet, including clients, freelancers, visitors, and search engines such as Google and Bing, and may appear on TeachRN partners' sites. You may edit certain information in your Profile via your account. If, in any case, you believe that an unauthorized profile has been created about you, you can request for it to be removed by contacting us at Support@teachrn.com</p>
<h3 id="identity-verification">Identity Verification</h3>
<p>We place a premium on trust in our Service, so we may take steps to verify your identity.</p>
<p>Before a Freelancer can complete registration on the Service, or at any time thereafter, we may request or re-request identity verification. Without limiting the manner in which we request identity verification, we may require Freelancers to participate in a video call after submitting their government issued ID to enable us to confirm that the Freelancer is indeed the individual in the ID. We may record such video calls and take screenshots of the user during the call. TeachRN may use the information obtained from Identity Verification for purposes of verifying your identity, enforcing our Terms of Service and other agreements, and preventing fraud.</p>
<h3 id="messaging">Messaging</h3>
<p>Freelancers, and Clients may communicate with each other through the Service. For example, Freelancers, and Clients may wish to discuss Client needs and Freelancer work proposals. If you communicate with a Client, that Client will also be a “data controller” with respect to such communications.</p>

<p>We take a number of steps to protect your data, but no security is guaranteed.</p>
<p>TeachRN takes commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure the information it collects and stores about TeachRN Users. All access to the Site is encrypted using industry-standard transport layer security technology (“TLS”). When you enter sensitive information (such as tax identification number), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”). We also use HTTP strict transport security to add an additional layer of protection for our TeachRN Users. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, TeachRN cannot ensure and does not warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
<h2 id="8-international-transfer-of-personal-information">8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Because we are a U.S. company, we process and store your information in the United States and our service providers may process and store it elsewhere.</p>
<p>TeachRN is a U.S. company. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, TeachRN transfers Personal Information to the United States for processing, and our service providers may process Personal Information in the United States and elsewhere. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your information to the United States, we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When we transfer Personal Information from territories in the EEA or with similar laws to our affiliates or service providers in the United States and elsewhere outside the EEA, we rely on approved data transfer mechanisms, which may include standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission and the Privacy Shield, as described below. You may request a copy of the standard contractual clauses relevant to your Personal Information, if any, using the contact information below.</p>
<h2 id="9-links-to-other-sites">9. LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h2>
<p>Our Service contains links to other websites. If you choose to click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information from you. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
<h2 id="10-public-profile">10. PUBLIC PROFILE</h2>
<p>The profile you create on our Site will be publicly accessible unless otherwise indicated. This means it will be visible to the entire Internet, including clients, freelancers, visitors, and search engines such as Google and Bing, and may appear on TeachRN partners' sites. You may change the privacy settings of your profile through your account portal.</p>
<h2 id="11-phishing">11. PHISHING</h2>
<p>Phishing websites imitate legitimate websites in order to obtain personal or financial information. Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to TeachRN. For more information about phishing, visit the website of the Federal Trade Commission at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing . In addition, if you believe you have received an email or had a similar interaction with a third party pretending to be TeachRN, please report it at Support@teachrn.com.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</p>
<p>Under Nevada law, certain Nevada residents may opt out of the sale of “personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Personally identifiable information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.</p>
<p>We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by emailing Support@teachrn.com. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.</p>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy. If we make substantial changes, we will provide notice.</p>
<p>TeachRN may update this Privacy Policy at any time and any changes will be effective upon posting. In the event that there are substantial changes to the way we treat your Personal Information, we will display a notice through the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We may also notify you by email, in our discretion. However, we will use your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent to the new or revised policy.</p>

<h3 id="rights">Rights</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.</li>
<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li>
<li>Delete certain information we have about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights.</p>
<p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through the Data Request Form available by email at Support@teachrn.com. You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p>
<p>Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Service to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Service.</p>
<p>The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information. Based on the definition of “sell” under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months.</p>
