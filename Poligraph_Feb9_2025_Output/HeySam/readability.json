Data Controller / ProcessorCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR, UK GDPR, Brazilian Data Protection Act, and the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the \u201cdata controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cdata processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.HeySam is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of Prospect Data.

Such data is processed by HeySam for its own purposes (as described in Section 2 above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our Customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.Accordingly, HeySam processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with our Customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such Customer.Our Customers are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services, and for ensuring that all individuals using the Services on the Customer\u2019s behalf or at their request, as well as all individuals whose personal data may be included in Customer Data processed through the Services, have been provided with adequate notice and given informed consent to the processing of their personal data, where such consent is necessary or advised, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording, use or other processing of data through our Services are fully met by the Customer, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship. Our Customers are also responsible for handling data subject rights requests under applicable law, by their Users and other individuals whose data they process through the Services.10. Opt-Out of Sale / SharingSome cookie-based sharing may be considered a \"sale\" under US privacy laws.
