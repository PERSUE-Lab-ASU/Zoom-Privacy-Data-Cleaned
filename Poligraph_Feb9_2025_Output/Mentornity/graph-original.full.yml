  - As a Member we will collect additional Personal Data from you, sometimes for our
    own purposes and other times on behalf of an Organiser (see Section Data Protection
    Regulations for more information).
  - As an Organiser, we will collect additional Personal Data from you.
  - For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide
    to answer your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email
    address from which the contact came.
  - For instance, if you supply Personal Data relating to your identity or qualifications

    a decision as to granting you access to use such Services and to assess your ongoing
    qualification to use such Services.
  - However, certain Personal Data is collected automatically and, if some Personal
    Data, such as Organisation setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to
    provide the Services.
  - However, if you register for an Organisation as a Member, we will process your
    Personal Data to help administer that Organisation on behalf of the Organiser
    (for example, sending confirmation, notification and feedback emails, processing
    payments, etc.) and to help the Organiser target, and understand the success of,
    their program (for example, providing event/meeting reports, using analytics to
    gain insights into the effectiveness of various marketing channels, etc.).
  - However, we may retain Personal Data for an additional period as is permitted
    or required under applicable laws.
  - If you have an account with us, we will typically retain your Personal Data for
    a period of 90 days after you have requested that your account is closed or if
    it's been inactive for 7 years.
  - If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the Personal Data
    in connection with the purpose for which it was provided.
  - If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of the Services
    or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with
    access to or use of the Services or functionality and to analyze your use of such
