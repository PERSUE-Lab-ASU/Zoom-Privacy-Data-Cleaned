For example, a user will enter their password to log on to their account. Once they have entered the correct password, they will then receive a text message with a unique code (often, the user is asked to enter a valid cellphone number when first setting up the account). The account will prompt the user to enter that unique code. If the password and the code are both correct, the user is permitted entry to their account.</p>\n                                <p>Two-factor authentication offers a higher level of security than a password alone. This process makes it harder for attackers to gain access to a person\u2019s account because knowing the password is not enough to gain entry.  Sometimes, an account will only require two-factor authentication if you\u2019re logging in from a new device, such a computer that isn\u2019t yours.</p>\n                                <p>Two-factor authentication is available to all Condo Control users. We strongly encourage everyone to use it and add an additional layer of protection to their account.  </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <!-- col -->\n\n                  \n                    <p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20200%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" data-lazy-src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Use-two-factor.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n                    </p>\n                    <!-- col --> \n                     \n                </div>\n                <!-- row -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            </div>\n            <!-- best-practices -->\n\n\n\n            <div id=\"client-data\">\n                \n                <div>\n                       <h4>Some information should never be shared</h4>\n                        \n\n                        <p>We are in the business of selling software, not client data.

All data transfers are encrypted to prevent unauthorized third parties from gaining access to your data. In addition, your account password is stored using a technique called a \u201cone-way hash\u201d. This means that only you (not even Condo Control employees) know your password.\n                                  Firewalls. All access to the \u201cback-end\u201d functions of Condo Control is protected with a firewall to ensure that only authorized individuals have access.\n                                  Minimum password length and password lockout. Your Condo Control password must be at least 8 characters long. In addition, we will lock out your account and request that you to reset your password if 5 wrong passwords are entered. This is to prevent unauthorized users from guessing your password.\n                                  Notification of login from a new device. Every time your account is used on a new computer, you will receive an email notice. This ensures that you are aware if someone logs into your account without your permission. \n                                  Tracking of IP addresses. Whenever an end-user accesses Condo Control, we record their IP address so that we can identify where the request came from. This assists us in the event that a security-related investigation is required. \n                                   Two-factor authentication. We enable and use two-factor authentication wherever possible for back-end services used by Condo Control and it is also available for anyone who is accessing our platform.\n\n                                \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                \n                \n\n\n                \n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                       Process Safeguards                                        \n                                        \n                                  Training.

From time to time, we may work with third parties to conduct our business. Third parties will only be given access to client data if absolutely required, and in these cases, they will be contractually obligated to follow our privacy policy.

That includes the security features we have designed exclusively for them. We believe it\u2019s important to give you the tools you need to take full control of your own account. All of our clients should follow these best practices when using Condo Control.\n                    \n                \n            \n\n               \n\n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                     \n                  \n\n                    \n                       Customize groups and permissions \n                                       \n              Administrators have the authority to create separate groups for different roles, and make sure that people are in the correct groups for their role. That means all residents can be categorized into one group, and security staff can be added to a completely separate group. \n               You can confidently send sensitive information to a specific group without having to worry that it will end up in the wrong hands. You can even specify which Condo Control features your groups have access to, and how they can use certain features.\n              Groups can be created and edited under Setup > Groups. (include screenshots from setup of groups permissions listing for both a staff & resident groups) \n\n              When creating multiple groups, make sure that they are properly marked as \u201cstaff\u201d or \u201cresident\u201d to avoid any confusion or mix-ups. As a precautionary measure, groups marked as \u201cResident\u201d will never be able to access any of the administrative features or functions. \n                    \n                    \n\n                     \n                  \n                \n                \n\n\n                \n                \n                    \n                  \n                  \n\n                    \n                       Minimize access to a need-to-know basis\n                  Always give people the minimum access required to do their job, never more. If they need more access later, it\u2019s always easy to expand your team\u2019s access if necessary.\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                    \n                     \n\n                     \n                \n                \n\n\n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                     \n                    \n                       Always use individual accounts\n                                        \n                                        We can\u2019t emphasize this enough: Never use a shared account. Creating a joint or shared account for you and your colleague may seem harmless, but it can create issues if one person suddenly changes the password, and it makes it more challenging for you to track any changes made to the account.\n                                Condo Control never charges for additional administrative accounts, so there\u2019s no reason why you should feel obligated to share an account. When you\u2019re the only one who manages your account, you maintain control of everything that happens within it, and it\u2019s far less likely that you would be held accountable for something that you didn\u2019t do.     \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n\n                     \n                \n                \n\n\n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n\n\n                    \n                       Use two-factor authentication \n                                        \n                                        Two-factor authentication, sometimes referred to as two-step verification, is a security process where the person who is trying to log in to an account or app must provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. For example, a user will enter their password to log on to their account. Once they have entered the correct password, they will then receive a text message with a unique code (often, the user is asked to enter a valid cellphone number when first setting up the account). The account will prompt the user to enter that unique code. If the password and the code are both correct, the user is permitted entry to their account.\n                                Two-factor authentication offers a higher level of security than a password alone. This process makes it harder for attackers to gain access to a person\u2019s account because knowing the password is not enough to gain entry.  Sometimes, an account will only require two-factor authentication if you\u2019re logging in from a new device, such a computer that isn\u2019t yours.\n                                Two-factor authentication is available to all Condo Control users. We strongly encourage everyone to use it and add an additional layer of protection to their account.  \n                    \n                    \n\n                  \n                    \n                    \n                     \n                     \n                \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n\n\n            \n                \n                \n                       Some information should never be shared\n                        \n\n                        We are in the business of selling software, not client data.

This information is required of all units, not just the units which use the system, in order to provide full functionality to a condo\u2019s property management team. Many features, like reports, will not provide full and useful information if the entire list of units and owners is not loaded into the system.\n                            Below is a table that lists the data elements that we collect, and how we use that data to provide our services.\n                            In this table, the term \u201cAdministrative Users\u201d refers to board members or property managers.\n                            Upon commencing service with us, the board or property manager turns over current copies of the above personal information so that we may get all system functions up and running. By turning over this information to us, the board is providing their consent for us to use the information as outlined above.\n                            In cases where owners provide updates to their own information through our online system, the online system explains how the information will be used.\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n                \n                 \n                    \n                  \n                       \n\n                    \n                       Disclosure\n                                        \n                                        We will never share or disclose your private information to anyone unless directed by a court order.  \n                    \n                    \n\n                                     \n                    \n                \n\n\n                \n                 \n                    \n                       Retention\n                                        \n                                        If you terminate your relationship with Condo Control, your information will be removed immediately inaccessible in our production system.

As an additional precaution, all of our client data is backed up to a third site every 15 minutes. \n                    \n                    \n\n                                      \n                    \n                \n\n\n                \n                    \n                       Backups \n                  We retain backups of client data for 12 months rolling.

PIPEDA applies to private-sector organizations across Canada that collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of a commercial activity. Businesses must follow the  10 fair information principles to protect personal information, which are listed in Schedule 1 of PIPEDA. \n                           Our privacy policy specifically addresses all items required for compliance. For example, we will use your personal information to verify your identity, as required by PIPEDA, when you contact us with a request to make sure it is really you. \n                    \n                    \n\n                                      \n                    \n                \n\n\n                \n                    \n                       Anti-Spam Legislation \n                  \n                  We are compliant with the Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) and the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act. CASL protects consumers and businesses from the misuse of digital technology, including spam and other electronic threats. The U.S. CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to stop receiving emails from a company, and bestows penalties for violations. Our company is fully compliant with all requirements, including unsubscribe management, proper labeling of all messages, and conformation from administrators before they can post an announcement. \n                            We give residents the control to unsubscribe from Condo Control emails at any time. They can also customize their preferences so they can opt-out of certain notices without fully unsubscribing. \n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n                \n                    \n\n\n                  <\n                     \n\n                    \n                       PCI compliance\n                                        \n                                        Payment card industry (PCI) compliance is mandated by credit card companies to help ensure the security of credit card transactions. Payment card industry compliance refers to the technical and operational standards that businesses must follow to secure and protect credit card data provided by cardholders. We are not PCI compliant, because our partner, Stripe, is. Condo Control has integrated with Stripe so that residents can easily and conveniently pay for amenity bookings, buy items such as a replacement key or remote control, or pay a condo fee or invoice. Stripe manages and holds all card data submitted through Condo Control; we do not hold any payment card data.  \n                    \n                    \n\n                                       \n                    \n                \n\n\n                \n                    \n                       Do you have additional questions about compliance?\n                                        \n                                         If you have questions about compliance with any specific privacy laws that may apply to your state or country, please submit your inquiry  here\n                    \n                    \n\n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               \n            \n            \n\n\n\n         \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n    \n\n\n     \n\n \n\n    \n  \n     \n    \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\t\n\n\t", "length": 31005, "excerpt": "Our clients never have to sacrifice security for convenience.
