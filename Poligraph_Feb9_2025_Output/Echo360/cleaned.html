Our key business systems are GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA compliant and certified as SOC2 compliant. Systems and processes have been scrutinized for limiting access to only required personnel, and the proper protections and restrictions to physical accessibility have been implemented to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.&nbsp; We use reasonable security measures when transmitting Personal Information to consumers in responding to requests under the California Consumer Privacy Act.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends upon you.&nbsp; Where you use a password for access to restricted parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping your password confidential.&nbsp; Do not share your password with anyone.</p>

<p><em><u>Verification Process</u></em><em>.</em>&nbsp;We are required by law to verify the identities of those who submit requests to know or to delete. To determine whether the individual making the request is the consumer about whom we have collected information, we will verify your identity by matching the identifying information provided by you in the request to the personal information that we already maintain about you. As a part of this process, you will be required to provide your full name, account number, address, and telephone number. We will inform you if we cannot verify your identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we cannot verify the identity of the person making a request for categories of Personal Information, we may deny the request. If the request is denied in whole or in part for this reason, we will provide a copy of, or direct you to, our privacy policy.</li>
<li>If we cannot verify the identity of the person making the request for specific pieces of Personal Information, we are prohibited from disclosing any specific pieces of Personal Information to the requestor.

<li>If we cannot verify the identity of the person making a request to delete, we may deny the request.</li>
<li>If there is no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor to the degree of certainty required, we will state this in our response and explain why we have no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>

However, we will not require these actions if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to the California Probate Code.</p>
<p><strong><u>Excessive Requests</u></strong>. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either (1) charge a reasonable fee, or (2) refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the request. If we charge a fee, the amount will be based upon the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested.</p>
<p><strong><u>Time Period to Comply with Requests</u></strong>.&nbsp; We will disclose and deliver the required information as requested by you pursuant to this Section free of charge, correct inaccurate Personal Information, or delete your Personal Information, based on your request, within 45 days of receiving a verifiable request, but will confirm receipt of your request within 10 business days of receipt of same. We will promptly take steps to determine whether the request is a verifiable consumer request, as set forth herein, but this shall not extend our duty to disclose and deliver the information, to correct inaccurate Personal Information, or to delete Personal Information within 45 days of receipt of the request. However, the time period to provide the required information, to correct inaccurate Personal Information, or to delete Personal Information may be extended once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary, provided we provide you with notice of the extension within the first 45-day period.</p>

									<p class="p1">Echo360 is committed to providing a workplace that is free of verbal, physical and visual forms of harassment so that everyone can work in a productive, respectful and professional environment. We prohibit all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, as defined below. The company expects all relationships between employees will be business-like and free of bias, prejudice, and harassment. These expectations apply in the workplace and in any work-related settings. This policy applies to in-person conduct, email, text message, social media, and other communications. Please know that conduct may violate this policy and our expectations regarding workplace behavior even if it is not considered unlawful.</p><ul><li class="p1"><strong>Discrimination.</strong> Discrimination means treating employes differently in the terms or conditions of employment or denying a benefit because of or based on a Protected Category.</li><li class="p1"><strong>Sexual Harassment.</strong> Sexual harassment is a type of harassment that is illegal. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: submitting to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of employment; submitting to or rejecting the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision; or the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with your work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, even if the person making the report is not the intended target of the conduct. Sexual harassment also occurs when a person in authority tries to trade job benefits for sexual favors. This can include hiring, promotion, continued employment or any other terms, or conditions or privileges of employment. This is also called “quid pro quo” harassment.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors. Sexual harassment includes harassment based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and the status of being transgender or gender non-conforming. It can occur between males and females, persons of the same sex, and involve individuals who are transgender or gender non-conforming. An act may be sexual harassment regardless of the sexual desire, sexual orientation, or intent of the harasser.</p><p class="p1">Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendos; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual’s body, sexual capability or sexual deficiencies; staring, whistling or touching; obscene comments or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, including texting (a/k/a sexting) other such sexually suggestive objects or pictures via the company or personal cell phone or computer; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature.</p><ul><li class="p1"><strong>Harassment.</strong> This policy also applies to and prohibits harassment which is unwelcome verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct that degrades or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of their Protected Category and creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance. Examples of this type of prohibited harassment include, for example: use of racial or religious epithets, slurs, or physical gestures; mocking, ridiculing, or mimicking someone’s culture, accent, appearance, or customs; and/or making jokes, pranks, or behaving in a threatening, intimidating, or hostile way because of someone’s protected status.</li><li class="p1"><strong>Retaliation. </strong>Retaliation is any type of action that adversely affects the terms of employment or the working environment because the individual made a complaint pursuant to the company’s policies against discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; encouraged someone to make a report or complaint; participated in the company investigation or legal/administrative proceeding under this policy; or opposed practices or conduct prohibited by the company’s policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment.</li><li class="p1"><strong>Protected Categories:</strong> Protected categories include, for example, race; color; religion; creed; national origin; ancestry; citizenship; age; sex (including pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions and transgender status); gender (including gender identity and gender expression); sexual orientation; familial/marital status; reproductive health decision-making; genetic information (including predisposing genetic characteristics); disability; medical condition; military/veteran status; prior arrest/conviction record; or status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or any characteristic protected by federal law or the state or local laws in your work location (“Protected Categories”).</li></ul>								</div>

Anonymous complaints, however, are often more difficult to investigate. With that in mind, we strongly recommend that anyone who makes an anonymous complaint provide as much specific information as possible.</li><li class="p1">If you are a member of company management and you learn about conduct that is or may be in violation of this policy, whether informally, through a formal complaint, or otherwise, you must immediately report it to Human Resources.</li></ul><p class="p1">If you see, witness, or experience a violation of another company policy, we encourage you to share your concerns by reporting right away – even if you are not certain a violation occurred. When you report concerns, you help us handle issues properly, fix problems before they occur and remedy situations that have already happened. You also help build trust with each other and with our customers, our suppliers and other business partners. To report concerns, please reach out in the following order: your manager; another manager at Echo360; Human Resources; the CEO.</p><p class="p1">When reporting a concern, we will do all we can to protect your identity consistent with conducting a thorough investigation. We take every report seriously and will investigate it thoroughly and as confidentially as possible. We expect everyone involved to cooperate fully and honestly.</p><p class="p1">The company encourages prompt reporting of complaints or concerns so it can take rapid and constructive action. Early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. We ask that you report your violations of this policy as described above, because we believe that it is the most efficient way to address issues that may arise. We recognize that employees may have other means to resolve workplace issues, and this policy is not intended to prevent employees from utilizing other avenues that may be available to them under state or federal law.</p><p class="p1">The company will promptly and thoroughly investigate all claims of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. Complaints will be handled with sensitivity, discretion and confidentiality to the extent allowed by the circumstances and the law. Generally, this means that allegations are shared with those who have a need to know so that the company can conduct an effective investigation.</p><p class="p1">The complaining employee is usually requested to provide as many details as possible, such as the dates(s), location(s), names(s) of witnesses, or information about the alleged harasser(s). Persons with relevant information are interviewed as needed. During the investigation, steps may be taken, when appropriate, to minimize contact between the involved employees, like schedule changes, temporary transfers or investigatory leave. The company will evaluate the information gathered; reach reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected; and take appropriate remedial, corrective, and/or disciplinary action as necessary. Such action may include, by way of example only, discipline, reassignments, changes in reporting relationships, training, suspension, or termination of employment.</p><p class="p1">No action will be taken against any employee who in good faith files a complaint of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation or assists in the investigation of such a complaint. Employees who believe they have been retaliated against for having reported harassment or participated in an investigation must promptly notify any member of the Human Resources staff so such concerns can be investigated.</p>								</div>

									<p class="p1">Echo360 does not discriminate on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. This policy is designed to create a safe and productive workplace environment for all employees.</p><p class="p1">This policy sets forth guidelines to address the needs of transgender and gender non-conforming employees and clarifies how the law should be implemented in situations where questions may arise about how to protect the legal rights or safety of such employees. This policy does not anticipate every situation that might occur with respect to transgender or gender non-conforming employees, and the needs of each transgender or gender non-conforming employee must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, Echo360 strives to secure a safe and non-discriminatory work environment for all employees.</p><p class="p1">The definitions provided here are not intended to label employees but rather to assist in understanding this policy and the legal obligations of employers. Employees may or may not use these terms to describe themselves.</p><p class="p1">•<strong> Gender identity:</strong> A person’s internal, deeply-felt sense of being male, female, or something else, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth. Everyone has a gender identity.</p><p class="p1">• <strong>Gender expression:</strong> An individual’s characteristics and behaviors (such as appearance, dress, mannerisms, speech patterns, and social interactions) that may be perceived as associated with a gender.</p><p class="p1">• <strong>Transgender:</strong> An umbrella term that can be used to describe people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from their sex assigned at birth.</p><ul><li>A person whose sex assigned at birth was female but who identifies as male is a transgender man (also known as female-to male transgender person, or FTM).</li><li>A person whose sex assigned at birth was male but who identifies as female is a transgender woman (also known as male-to-female transgender person, or MTF).</li><li>Some people described by this definition don’t consider themselves transgender – they may use other words, or may identify simply as a man or woman. A person does not need to identify as transgender in order for an employer’s nondiscrimination policies to apply to them.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="p1"><strong>Gender non-conforming:</strong> This term describes people who have, or are perceived to have, gender characteristics and/or behaviors that do not conform to traditional or societal expectations. Keep in mind that these expectations can vary across cultures and have changed over time.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Transition:</strong> The process of changing one’s gender from the sex assigned at birth to one’s gender identity. There are many different ways to transition. For some people, it is a complex process that takes place over a long period of time, while for others it is a one- or two-step process that happens more quickly. Transition may include “coming out” (telling family, friends, and coworkers); changing the name and/or sex on legal documents; and, for many transgender people, accessing medical treatment such as hormones and surgery.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Sexual orientation:</strong> A person’s physical or emotional attraction to people of the same and/or other gender. Straight, gay, and bisexual are some ways to describe sexual orientation. It is important to note that sexual orientation is distinct from gender identity and expression. Transgender people can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight, just like non-transgender people.</p><p class="p1"><strong>LGBT</strong>: A common abbreviation that refers to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Privacy:</strong> Transgender employees have the right to discuss their gender identity or expression openly, or to keep that information private. A transgender employee may decide when, with whom, and how much to share their private information, and Echo360 will strive to handle communications with regard to changes to an employee’s gender identity or expression with sensitivity and input from the employee.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Official Records:</strong> Echo360 will change an employee’s official record to reflect a change in preferred name or gender identity upon request from the employee. Certain types of records, like those relating to payroll and retirement accounts, may require a legal name change before the person’s name can be changed. Most records, however, can be changed to reflect a person’s preferred name without proof of a legal name change. If a new or transitioning employee has questions about company records or ID documents, the employee should contact Human Resources.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Names/Pronouns:</strong> An employee has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to the employee’s gender identity. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required. The intentional or persistent refusal to respect an employee’s gender identity (for example, intentionally referring to the employee by a name or pronoun that does not correspond to the employee’s gender identity or preferred name) can constitute harassment and is a violation of this policy. If you are unsure what pronoun a transitioning coworker might prefer, you can politely ask your coworker how they would like to be addressed.</p>								</div>

Communication with healthcare professionals may be necessary to verify the existence of a disability or work restrictions, to identify potential reasonable accommodations, and/or to assess if an accommodation would cause undue hardship. Employees are required to cooperate with this process by providing all necessary documentation supporting the need for accommodation and to consider alternative accommodations when applicable.

<p class="p1">• Continually improve over time by striving to measure our environmental impacts and by setting goals to reduce these impacts each year.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IMPACT A: Solution Sustainability</b></p>
<p class="p1">Echo360’s solution is hosted by Amazon Web Services and Echo360 trusts AWS to minimise its impact on the environment as much as possible. AWS has publicly shared its commitment to sustainable energy with a goal to power the global AWS infrastructure with 100% renewable energy by 2025.</p>
<p class="p1">AWS is rapidly progressing towards meeting these goals by focusing on four complementary areas.</p>
<p class="p1">• First, AWS is continuously working on ways to increase the energy efficiency of its facilities and equipment, innovating the design and manufacture of its servers, storage, and networking equipment to reduce energy use and improve operational excellence as the business grows.</p>
<p class="p1">• Second, AWS works with industry associations, international, federal, and state governments to increase incentives and create a more favourable environment for renewable energy.</p>
<p class="p1">• Third, AWS works with its various power providers that supply AWS data centres around the world to increase the availability of renewables in their power supply while maintaining low prices.</p>
<p class="p1">• And fourth, AWS has funded many wind and solar PPAs to increase the overall amount of renewable energy available on the grids that serve AWS data centres.</p>
<p class="p1">These initiatives will be extended to the global AWS data centres over time.</p>
<p class="p1">Amazon is part of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE – <span class="s1">http://www.acore.org/</span>) and participates in the U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance (US PREF – <span class="s1">http://uspref.org/</span>) to increase its work with state and federal policymakers and other stakeholders to enable more renewable energy opportunities for cloud providers.</p>
<p class="p1">Please visit <span class="s1">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/ </span>for more details about AWS’s approach to sustainability.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IMPACT B: Employee Energy and Resource Use</b></p>
<p class="p2">Below are the guidelines followed at the Company’s workplace settings and encouraged at employees’ remote work settings:</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Energy Use</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Echo360 off lights, computers, and other equipment when not in use.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Adjusting the thermostat to save energy during non-business hours.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Using energy-efficient appliances and equipment where possible.</p>
<p class="p2"><b style="">Resource Use</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Reducing paper use by printing double-sided and only when necessary.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Using refillable water bottles and coffee cups instead of disposable ones.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Recycling paper, plastics, and other materials.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Using reusable bags and containers for lunch and snacks.</p>
<p class="p2"><b style="">Personal Responsibility</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Considering the environmental impact of your actions both at work and at home.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Encouraging colleagues to adopt sustainable practices.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">• </span>Reporting any energy or resource waste to management.</p>								</div>
