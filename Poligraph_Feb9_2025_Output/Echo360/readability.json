We prohibit all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, as defined below. The company expects all relationships between employees will be business-like and free of bias, prejudice, and harassment. These expectations apply in the workplace and in any work-related settings. This policy applies to in-person conduct, email, text message, social media, and other communications. Please know that conduct may violate this policy and our expectations regarding workplace behavior even if it is not considered unlawful.</p><ul><li><strong>Discrimination.</strong> Discrimination means treating employes differently in the terms or conditions of employment or denying a benefit because of or based on a Protected Category.</li><li><strong>Sexual Harassment.</strong> Sexual harassment is a type of harassment that is illegal. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: submitting to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of employment; submitting to or rejecting the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision; or the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with your work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, even if the person making the report is not the intended target of the conduct. Sexual harassment also occurs when a person in authority tries to trade job benefits for sexual favors. This can include hiring, promotion, continued employment or any other terms, or conditions or privileges of employment. This is also called \u201cquid pro quo\u201d harassment.</li></ul><p>Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors. Sexual harassment includes harassment based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and the status of being transgender or gender non-conforming. It can occur between males and females, persons of the same sex, and involve individuals who are transgender or gender non-conforming. An act may be sexual harassment regardless of the sexual desire, sexual orientation, or intent of the harasser.</p><p>Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendos; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual\u2019s body, sexual capability or sexual deficiencies; staring, whistling or touching; obscene comments or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, including texting (a/k/a sexting) other such sexually suggestive objects or pictures via the company or personal cell phone or computer; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature.</p><ul><li><strong>Harassment.</strong> This policy also applies to and prohibits harassment which is unwelcome verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct that degrades or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of their Protected Category and creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes with an individual\u2019s work performance. Examples of this type of prohibited harassment include, for example: use of racial or religious epithets, slurs, or physical gestures; mocking, ridiculing, or mimicking someone\u2019s culture, accent, appearance, or customs; and/or making jokes, pranks, or behaving in a threatening, intimidating, or hostile way because of someone\u2019s protected status.</li><li><strong>Retaliation. </strong>Retaliation is any type of action that adversely affects the terms of employment or the working environment because the individual made a complaint pursuant to the company\u2019s policies against discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; encouraged someone to make a report or complaint; participated in the company investigation or legal/administrative proceeding under this policy; or opposed practices or conduct prohibited by the company\u2019s policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment.</li><li><strong>Protected Categories:</strong> Protected categories include, for example, race; color; religion; creed; national origin; ancestry; citizenship; age; sex (including pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions and transgender status); gender (including gender identity and gender expression); sexual orientation; familial/marital status; reproductive health decision-making; genetic information (including predisposing genetic characteristics); disability; medical condition; military/veteran status; prior arrest/conviction record; or status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or any characteristic protected by federal law or the state or local laws in your work location (\u201cProtected Categories\u201d).</li></ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"b53bfdb\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;jet_parallax_layout_list&quot;:[]}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"67323e4\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>REPORTING EEO, DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND RETALIATION CONCERNS</h2>\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"c8e618b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you see, witness, or experience a violation of the company\u2019s expectations surrounding EEO, non-discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation promptly follow the reporting procedures below:</p><ul><li>If possible, document in writing the date, time, place, witnesses, what was said or done, and the surrounding circumstances.</li><li>If you are comfortable doing so, communicate your objections to the conduct and promptly tell the person engaging in the conduct it is unwelcome and offensive.

You may also escalate concerns to the CEO.</strong></li><li>You may provide your name or remain anonymous. If you wish to remain anonymous, we partner with EthicsPoint, and you may submit an anonymous message through contacting 855-233-3139. Anonymous complaints, however, are often more difficult to investigate. With that in mind, we strongly recommend that anyone who makes an anonymous complaint provide as much specific information as possible.</li><li>If you are a member of company management and you learn about conduct that is or may be in violation of this policy, whether informally, through a formal complaint, or otherwise, you must immediately report it to Human Resources.</li></ul><p>If you see, witness, or experience a violation of another company policy, we encourage you to share your concerns by reporting right away \u2013 even if you are not certain a violation occurred. When you report concerns, you help us handle issues properly, fix problems before they occur and remedy situations that have already happened. You also help build trust with each other and with our customers, our suppliers and other business partners. To report concerns, please reach out in the following order: your manager; another manager at Echo360; Human Resources; the CEO.</p><p>When reporting a concern, we will do all we can to protect your identity consistent with conducting a thorough investigation. We take every report seriously and will investigate it thoroughly and as confidentially as possible. We expect everyone involved to cooperate fully and honestly.</p><p>The company encourages prompt reporting of complaints or concerns so it can take rapid and constructive action. Early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. We ask that you report your violations of this policy as described above, because we believe that it is the most efficient way to address issues that may arise. We recognize that employees may have other means to resolve workplace issues, and this policy is not intended to prevent employees from utilizing other avenues that may be available to them under state or federal law.</p><p>The company will promptly and thoroughly investigate all claims of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. Complaints will be handled with sensitivity, discretion and confidentiality to the extent allowed by the circumstances and the law. Generally, this means that allegations are shared with those who have a need to know so that the company can conduct an effective investigation.</p><p>The complaining employee is usually requested to provide as many details as possible, such as the dates(s), location(s), names(s) of witnesses, or information about the alleged harasser(s). Persons with relevant information are interviewed as needed. During the investigation, steps may be taken, when appropriate, to minimize contact between the involved employees, like schedule changes, temporary transfers or investigatory leave. The company will evaluate the information gathered; reach reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected; and take appropriate remedial, corrective, and/or disciplinary action as necessary. Such action may include, by way of example only, discipline, reassignments, changes in reporting relationships, training, suspension, or termination of employment.</p><p>No action will be taken against any employee who in good faith files a complaint of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation or assists in the investigation of such a complaint. Employees who believe they have been retaliated against for having reported harassment or participated in an investigation must promptly notify any member of the Human Resources staff so such concerns can be investigated.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"1ffa1dd\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;jet_parallax_layout_list&quot;:[]}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"da22b56\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>GENDER EQUALITY POLICY</h2>\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"9b74146\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Within the principle of providing equal employment opportunities for all qualified employees and applicants, the Company is committed to promoting a workplace culture that is inclusive, supportive, and respectful of all employees, regardless of gender.

This policy does not anticipate every situation that might occur with respect to transgender or gender non-conforming employees, and the needs of each transgender or gender non-conforming employee must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, Echo360 strives to secure a safe and non-discriminatory work environment for all employees.</p><p>The definitions provided here are not intended to label employees but rather to assist in understanding this policy and the legal obligations of employers. Employees may or may not use these terms to describe themselves.</p><p>\u2022<strong> Gender identity:</strong> A person\u2019s internal, deeply-felt sense of being male, female, or something else, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth. Everyone has a gender identity.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Gender expression:</strong> An individual\u2019s characteristics and behaviors (such as appearance, dress, mannerisms, speech patterns, and social interactions) that may be perceived as associated with a gender.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Transgender:</strong> An umbrella term that can be used to describe people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from their sex assigned at birth.</p><ul><li>A person whose sex assigned at birth was female but who identifies as male is a transgender man (also known as female-to male transgender person, or FTM).</li><li>A person whose sex assigned at birth was male but who identifies as female is a transgender woman (also known as male-to-female transgender person, or MTF).</li><li>Some people described by this definition don\u2019t consider themselves transgender \u2013 they may use other words, or may identify simply as a man or woman. A person does not need to identify as transgender in order for an employer\u2019s nondiscrimination policies to apply to them.</li></ul><p><strong>Gender non-conforming:</strong> This term describes people who have, or are perceived to have, gender characteristics and/or behaviors that do not conform to traditional or societal expectations. Keep in mind that these expectations can vary across cultures and have changed over time.</p><p><strong>Transition:</strong> The process of changing one\u2019s gender from the sex assigned at birth to one\u2019s gender identity. There are many different ways to transition. For some people, it is a complex process that takes place over a long period of time, while for others it is a one- or two-step process that happens more quickly. Transition may include \u201ccoming out\u201d (telling family, friends, and coworkers); changing the name and/or sex on legal documents; and, for many transgender people, accessing medical treatment such as hormones and surgery.</p><p><strong>Sexual orientation:</strong> A person\u2019s physical or emotional attraction to people of the same and/or other gender. Straight, gay, and bisexual are some ways to describe sexual orientation. It is important to note that sexual orientation is distinct from gender identity and expression. Transgender people can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight, just like non-transgender people.</p><p><strong>LGBT</strong>: A common abbreviation that refers to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.</p><p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Transgender employees have the right to discuss their gender identity or expression openly, or to keep that information private. A transgender employee may decide when, with whom, and how much to share their private information, and Echo360 will strive to handle communications with regard to changes to an employee\u2019s gender identity or expression with sensitivity and input from the employee.</p><p><strong>Official Records:</strong> Echo360 will change an employee\u2019s official record to reflect a change in preferred name or gender identity upon request from the employee. Certain types of records, like those relating to payroll and retirement accounts, may require a legal name change before the person\u2019s name can be changed. Most records, however, can be changed to reflect a person\u2019s preferred name without proof of a legal name change. If a new or transitioning employee has questions about company records or ID documents, the employee should contact Human Resources.</p><p><strong>Names/Pronouns:</strong> An employee has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to the employee\u2019s gender identity. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required. The intentional or persistent refusal to respect an employee\u2019s gender identity (for example, intentionally referring to the employee by a name or pronoun that does not correspond to the employee\u2019s gender identity or preferred name) can constitute harassment and is a violation of this policy. If you are unsure what pronoun a transitioning coworker might prefer, you can politely ask your coworker how they would like to be addressed.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"82aab24\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;jet_parallax_layout_list&quot;:[]}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"d707ce0\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY</h2>\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"93282c2\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Company is committed to conducting our business with integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

We prohibit all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, as defined below.

This policy applies to in-person conduct, email, text message, social media, and other communications. Please know that conduct may violate this policy and our expectations regarding workplace behavior even if it is not considered unlawful.Discrimination. Discrimination means treating employes differently in the terms or conditions of employment or denying a benefit because of or based on a Protected Category.Sexual Harassment. Sexual harassment is a type of harassment that is illegal. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: submitting to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of employment; submitting to or rejecting the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision; or the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with your work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, even if the person making the report is not the intended target of the conduct. Sexual harassment also occurs when a person in authority tries to trade job benefits for sexual favors. This can include hiring, promotion, continued employment or any other terms, or conditions or privileges of employment. This is also called \u201cquid pro quo\u201d harassment.Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors. Sexual harassment includes harassment based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and the status of being transgender or gender non-conforming.

An act may be sexual harassment regardless of the sexual desire, sexual orientation, or intent of the harasser.Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendos; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual\u2019s body, sexual capability or sexual deficiencies; staring, whistling or touching; obscene comments or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, including texting (a/k/a sexting) other such sexually suggestive objects or pictures via the company or personal cell phone or computer; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature.Harassment. This policy also applies to and prohibits harassment which is unwelcome verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct that degrades or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of their Protected Category and creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes with an individual\u2019s work performance.

Retaliation is any type of action that adversely affects the terms of employment or the working environment because the individual made a complaint pursuant to the company\u2019s policies against discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; encouraged someone to make a report or complaint; participated in the company investigation or legal/administrative proceeding under this policy; or opposed practices or conduct prohibited by the company\u2019s policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment.Protected Categories: Protected categories include, for example, race; color; religion; creed; national origin; ancestry; citizenship; age; sex (including pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions and transgender status); gender (including gender identity and gender expression); sexual orientation; familial/marital status; reproductive health decision-making; genetic information (including predisposing genetic characteristics); disability; medical condition; military/veteran status; prior arrest/conviction record; or status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or any characteristic protected by federal law or the state or local laws in your work location (\u201cProtected Categories\u201d).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tREPORTING EEO, DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND RETALIATION CONCERNS\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you see, witness, or experience a violation of the company\u2019s expectations surrounding EEO, non-discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation promptly follow the reporting procedures below:If possible, document in writing the date, time, place, witnesses, what was said or done, and the surrounding circumstances.If you are comfortable doing so, communicate your objections to the conduct and promptly tell the person engaging in the conduct it is unwelcome and offensive. In many cases, if an employee makes their feelings known to the offending persons, tells them the conduct is not appropriate, and asks them to stop, this may take care of the situation.Promptly report any offending behavior, whether such behavior is directed towards them personally or to other employees at Echo360 to any member of the Human Resources staff. You may also escalate concerns to the CEO.You may provide your name or remain anonymous. If you wish to remain anonymous, we partner with EthicsPoint, and you may submit an anonymous message through contacting 855-233-3139. Anonymous complaints, however, are often more difficult to investigate. With that in mind, we strongly recommend that anyone who makes an anonymous complaint provide as much specific information as possible.If you are a member of company management and you learn about conduct that is or may be in violation of this policy, whether informally, through a formal complaint, or otherwise, you must immediately report it to Human Resources.If you see, witness, or experience a violation of another company policy, we encourage you to share your concerns by reporting right away \u2013 even if you are not certain a violation occurred. When you report concerns, you help us handle issues properly, fix problems before they occur and remedy situations that have already happened.

We take every report seriously and will investigate it thoroughly and as confidentially as possible. We expect everyone involved to cooperate fully and honestly.The company encourages prompt reporting of complaints or concerns so it can take rapid and constructive action. Early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. We ask that you report your violations of this policy as described above, because we believe that it is the most efficient way to address issues that may arise. We recognize that employees may have other means to resolve workplace issues, and this policy is not intended to prevent employees from utilizing other avenues that may be available to them under state or federal law.The company will promptly and thoroughly investigate all claims of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. Complaints will be handled with sensitivity, discretion and confidentiality to the extent allowed by the circumstances and the law. Generally, this means that allegations are shared with those who have a need to know so that the company can conduct an effective investigation.The complaining employee is usually requested to provide as many details as possible, such as the dates(s), location(s), names(s) of witnesses, or information about the alleged harasser(s). Persons with relevant information are interviewed as needed. During the investigation, steps may be taken, when appropriate, to minimize contact between the involved employees, like schedule changes, temporary transfers or investigatory leave. The company will evaluate the information gathered; reach reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected; and take appropriate remedial, corrective, and/or disciplinary action as necessary. Such action may include, by way of example only, discipline, reassignments, changes in reporting relationships, training, suspension, or termination of employment.No action will be taken against any employee who in good faith files a complaint of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation or assists in the investigation of such a complaint. Employees who believe they have been retaliated against for having reported harassment or participated in an investigation must promptly notify any member of the Human Resources staff so such concerns can be investigated.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGENDER EQUALITY POLICY\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWithin the principle of providing equal employment opportunities for all qualified employees and applicants, the Company is committed to promoting a workplace culture that is inclusive, supportive, and respectful of all employees, regardless of gender.

We offer a range of support services, such as flexible work arrangements, access to child care or elder care resources, and time off for caregiving responsibilities.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTRANSGENDER POLICY\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEcho360 does not discriminate on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. This policy is designed to create a safe and productive workplace environment for all employees.This policy sets forth guidelines to address the needs of transgender and gender non-conforming employees and clarifies how the law should be implemented in situations where questions may arise about how to protect the legal rights or safety of such employees. This policy does not anticipate every situation that might occur with respect to transgender or gender non-conforming employees, and the needs of each transgender or gender non-conforming employee must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, Echo360 strives to secure a safe and non-discriminatory work environment for all employees.The definitions provided here are not intended to label employees but rather to assist in understanding this policy and the legal obligations of employers. Employees may or may not use these terms to describe themselves.\u2022 Gender identity: A person\u2019s internal, deeply-felt sense of being male, female, or something else, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth. Everyone has a gender identity.\u2022 Gender expression: An individual\u2019s characteristics and behaviors (such as appearance, dress, mannerisms, speech patterns, and social interactions) that may be perceived as associated with a gender.\u2022 Transgender: An umbrella term that can be used to describe people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from their sex assigned at birth.A person whose sex assigned at birth was female but who identifies as male is a transgender man (also known as female-to male transgender person, or FTM).A person whose sex assigned at birth was male but who identifies as female is a transgender woman (also known as male-to-female transgender person, or MTF).Some people described by this definition don\u2019t consider themselves transgender \u2013 they may use other words, or may identify simply as a man or woman. A person does not need to identify as transgender in order for an employer\u2019s nondiscrimination policies to apply to them.Gender non-conforming: This term describes people who have, or are perceived to have, gender characteristics and/or behaviors that do not conform to traditional or societal expectations. Keep in mind that these expectations can vary across cultures and have changed over time.Transition: The process of changing one\u2019s gender from the sex assigned at birth to one\u2019s gender identity. There are many different ways to transition. For some people, it is a complex process that takes place over a long period of time, while for others it is a one- or two-step process that happens more quickly. Transition may include \u201ccoming out\u201d (telling family, friends, and coworkers); changing the name and/or sex on legal documents; and, for many transgender people, accessing medical treatment such as hormones and surgery.Sexual orientation: A person\u2019s physical or emotional attraction to people of the same and/or other gender. Straight, gay, and bisexual are some ways to describe sexual orientation. It is important to note that sexual orientation is distinct from gender identity and expression. Transgender people can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight, just like non-transgender people.LGBT: A common abbreviation that refers to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.Privacy: Transgender employees have the right to discuss their gender identity or expression openly, or to keep that information private. A transgender employee may decide when, with whom, and how much to share their private information, and Echo360 will strive to handle communications with regard to changes to an employee\u2019s gender identity or expression with sensitivity and input from the employee.Official Records: Echo360 will change an employee\u2019s official record to reflect a change in preferred name or gender identity upon request from the employee. Certain types of records, like those relating to payroll and retirement accounts, may require a legal name change before the person\u2019s name can be changed. Most records, however, can be changed to reflect a person\u2019s preferred name without proof of a legal name change. If a new or transitioning employee has questions about company records or ID documents, the employee should contact Human Resources.Names/Pronouns: An employee has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to the employee\u2019s gender identity. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required. The intentional or persistent refusal to respect an employee\u2019s gender identity (for example, intentionally referring to the employee by a name or pronoun that does not correspond to the employee\u2019s gender identity or preferred name) can constitute harassment and is a violation of this policy. If you are unsure what pronoun a transitioning coworker might prefer, you can politely ask your coworker how they would like to be addressed.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Company is committed to conducting our business with integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

The goal of reasonable accommodations is to enable people with disabilities to overcome work-related barriers and to fostering an inclusive workplace. An individual may be considered disabled if they have an impairment that substantially limits one or more of their major life activities, a record or history of such an impairment, or is perceived as having such an impairment. The definition of disability also may include pregnant employees impacted by medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.If you believe you need an accommodation because of your disability, you are responsible for requesting a reasonable accommodation from the Human Resources Department. You may make the request orally or in writing. The company encourages employees to make their request in writing on a company form, available from Human Resources, and to include relevant information, such as:\u2022 A description of the accommodation you are requesting.\u2022 The reason you need an accommodation.\u2022 How the accommodation will help you perform the essential functions of your job.After receiving your oral or written request, the company will engage in an interactive dialogue with you to determine the precise limitations of your disability and explore potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. The company encourages you to suggest specific reasonable accommodations that you believe would allow you to perform your job. Please understand, however, that the company is not required to make the specific accommodation requested by you and may provide an alternative effective accommodation, to the extent any reasonable accommodation can be made without imposing an undue hardship on the company.The company makes determinations about reasonable accommodations on a case-by-case basis, considering various factors and based on an individualized assessment in each situation and strives to make determinations as expeditiously as possible. During the interactive process, Human Resources will partner with you, management, and healthcare provider(s) to assess if a reasonable accommodation is possible. Communication with healthcare professionals may be necessary to verify the existence of a disability or work restrictions, to identify potential reasonable accommodations, and/or to assess if an accommodation would cause undue hardship. Employees are required to cooperate with this process by providing all necessary documentation supporting the need for accommodation and to consider alternative accommodations when applicable. The company will treat medical information as confidential.The company strictly prohibits discrimination and retaliation against qualified individuals with disabilities who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of their job and prohibits retaliation for requesting an accommodation. If you believe you were retaliated against, please follow the reporting procedures in the Reporting EEO, Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Concerns policy.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe company recognizes and respects the diversity of religious beliefs, practices, and observances. When work obligations conflict with religious beliefs, the company is committed to exploring whether the company may provide an accommodation that will eliminate the conflict, while preserving your ability to fully perform the essential functions of your job.If you need a religious accommodation, discuss your request with Human Resources. The company will not retaliate against you for requesting an accommodation under this policy. If you believe you were retaliated against promptly notify Human Resources.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tENVIRONMENTAL POLICY STATEMENT\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEcho360 is committed to reducing its impact on the environment.
