<h2 class="wp-block-heading toppad" id="cookies">Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">What are cookies?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites. We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Cookies we use</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Sites use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</span><br>
</p><table id="tablepress-18" class="tablepress tablepress-id-18">

<tr class="row-3">
	<td class="column-1">Functionality Cookies</td><td class="column-2">These cookies allow our Sites to remember choices you make when you use our Sites. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-select your preferences every time you visit our Sites.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-4">
	<td class="column-1">Analytics and Performance Cookies</td><td class="column-2">These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Sites and how users use our Sites. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Sites, the websites that referred them to our Sites, the pages they visited on our Sites, what time of day they visited our Sites, whether they have visited our Sites before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Sites.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-5">
	<td class="column-1">Social Media Cookies</td><td class="column-2">These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Sites or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter. The social network will record that you have done this.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-6">
	<td class="column-1">Targeted and advertising cookies</td><td class="column-2">These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show advertisements which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites. You can disable certain cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting this site or, in the EU, this site. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.</td>

<p><br><span style="font-weight: 600;">Disabling cookies</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may choose to consent to our use of these cookies, reject all non-essential cookies, or further manage your cookies preferences through the cookie consent banner at the bottom of our website, or the green cookie icon if you have previously engaged with the cookie consent banner. To opt-out of sharing information related to these cookies and related technologies with third parties, please select “Reject All”. Please note that even if you opt-out of this information sharing with us, other companies may continue to use and disclose your information in the same manner. You should manage your preferences with regards to these practices with those other companies and websites, as applicable.</span></p>



<p>Additionally, you can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools,” or “edit” facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. To opt-out of sharing information related to these cookies with third parties, please select “Reject All”.

<p>If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Local Storage Objects</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store Your user information and settings. Third parties with whom We partner to provide certain features on Our site or to display advertising based upon Your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Pixel Tags</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Sites to track the actions of users on our Sites. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users’ personal data.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Framing</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to/from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our Sites. Please be aware that you are providing your information to these third parties and not to us.</span></p>

<p><strong>Exercising Your Rights</strong></p>



<p><strong>If you have a specific question or concern about your rights, questions about our Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights as a Californian consumer, please </strong><a href="https://www.bettercloud.com/privacy-policy/#contact"><strong>contact us</strong></a><strong> at privacy@bettercloud.com or use our </strong><a href="https://www.bettercloud.com/ccpa-request/"><strong>online request form</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>You may exercise these rights twice in a 12-month period. If an option is available to compensate you for the use of your information, you must be advised of this. We will make best efforts to address your requests within 45 days, but where that is not possible will advise you of the need for an extension of an additional 45 days.</p>

<p>After submitting your initial request, we may request additional information to verify your identity.
