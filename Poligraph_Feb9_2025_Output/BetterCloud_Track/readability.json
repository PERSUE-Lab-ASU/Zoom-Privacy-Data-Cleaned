We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites. We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.\n\n\n\nCookies we use\n\n\n\nOur Sites use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:\n\n\n\n\tType of cookiePurpose\n\n\n\n\n\tEssential CookiesThese cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Sites and to enable you to use some of its features. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.\n\n\n\tFunctionality CookiesThese cookies allow our Sites to remember choices you make when you use our Sites. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-select your preferences every time you visit our Sites.\n\n\n\tAnalytics and Performance CookiesThese cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Sites and how users use our Sites. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Sites, the websites that referred them to our Sites, the pages they visited on our Sites, what time of day they visited our Sites, whether they have visited our Sites before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Sites.\n\n\n\tSocial Media CookiesThese cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \u201clike\u201d button on our Sites or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter. The social network will record that you have done this.\n\n\n\tTargeted and advertising cookiesThese cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show advertisements which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites. You can disable certain cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting this site or, in the EU, this site. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisabling cookiesYou may choose to consent to our use of these cookies, reject all non-essential cookies, or further manage your cookies preferences through the cookie consent banner at the bottom of our website, or the green cookie icon if you have previously engaged with the cookie consent banner.

Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages.
