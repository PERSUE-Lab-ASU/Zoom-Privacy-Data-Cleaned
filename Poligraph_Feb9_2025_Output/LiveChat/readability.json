In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.</p>\n<p>This policy applies to all products built and maintained by SKlabs Software Ltd.</p>\n<h2>What we collect and why</h2>\n<p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here\u2019s what that means in practice:</p>\n<h3>Identity &amp; access</h3>\n<p>When you install an app developed by SKlabs Software Ltd, we store your email address to identify you as a customer.</p>\n<h3>Billing information</h3>\n<p>We do not store any billing information on our system. This is handled by our partners, such has <a href=\"https://livechat.com/\">https://livechat.com</a>, when you purchase one of our apps.</p>\n<h3>Geolocation data</h3>\n<p>Web analytics data \u2014 described further in the Website Interactions section \u2014 are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases.</p>\n<h3>Website interactions</h3>\n<p>When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting and page load timing.</p>\n<h3>Cookies</h3>\n<p>We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and support some in-house analytics. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site preferences, and more. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: <a href=\"https://www.allaboutcookies.org/\">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>\n<h3>Voluntary correspondence</h3>\n<p>When you write SKlabs Software Ltd with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.</p>\n<p>We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your express consent.</p>\n<h3>Information we do not collect</h3>\n<p>We don\u2019t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.</p>\n<p>We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to add a picture to your user profile, which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile pictures: they are for your use alone.</p>\n<h2>When we access or share your information</h2>\n<p>Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we\u2019ll ever access or share your info are:</p>\n<p><strong>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.</strong> If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.</p>\n<h2>Your rights with respect to your information</h2>\n<p>At SKlabs Software Ltd Software Ltd, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) in the US. SKlabs Software recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li>\n<li><strong>Right to Correction.</strong> You have the right to request correction of your personal information.</li>\n<li><strong>Right to Erasure / \u201cTo be Forgotten\u201d.</strong> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using SKlabs Software Ltd services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li>\n<li><strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to <a href=\"https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en\">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)</li>\n<li><strong>Right to Object.</strong> You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li>\n<li><strong>Right to Portability.</strong> You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li>\n<li><strong>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</strong> You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>\n<li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right \u201cto be forgotten\u201d) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@sklabs.dev\">support@sklabs.dev</a>.
