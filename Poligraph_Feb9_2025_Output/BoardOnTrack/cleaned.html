</ul>
<ul>

We require that our third-party service providers use your personal information only to provide the services we’ve requested. These third party service providers may be located outside the European Union.

</ul>
<h2><strong>LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING</strong></h2>
<p>This section addresses the legal basis for processing your information if you reside outside the United States (within the United States, you typically provide consent when you receive notice of this Policy in a website link). Some processing is addressed in multiple sections because more than one legal basis may apply depending on the circumstances or service.</p>
<p>We collect and process your personal information for a variety of purposes outlined in this Policy. In certain cases, separate consent is not required, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For Performance of a Contract. </strong>To perform our contractual obligations to you, including but not limited to fulfilling orders or purchases you have made (including processing of payment), contacting you in relation to any issues with your purchase and provision of the Services, where we need to provide your personal information to our service providers, where we need to collect personal information from third party sources and when you access third party products and services, where we collect data from third parties, or to aggregate and centralize data for the performance of the Services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>To Meet Legal Obligations.</strong> To comply with laws, regulations, court orders, or other legal obligations or to assist in an investigation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>For Legitimate Interests. </strong>To operate our business and provide the Services, other than in performing our contractual obligations to you for BoardOnTrack’s “legitimate interests” for the purposes of applicable law – except where overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of personal data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consent As a Basis For Processing.</strong> In some cases, we will ask for your consent to process your personal information. You may indicate your consent in a number of ways, including, as permitted by law, ticking a box (or equivalent action) to indicate your consent when (i) providing us with your personal information through our Services or a form; or (ii) registering or creating an account with us.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>ANONYMOUS DATA</strong></h2>
<p>When we use the term “anonymous data,” we’re referring to data and information that doesn’t permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third party.</p>
<p>We may create anonymous data from the personal data we receive about you and other individuals whose personal data we collect. Anonymous data might include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies.&nbsp;We make personal data into anonymous data by excluding information, such as your name, that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to BoardOnTrack.</p>
<h2><strong>INFORMATION THAT MAY BE VISIBLE TO OTHER USERS</strong></h2>
<p>If you have a member account on the BoardOnTrack Platform or Community forum within the Platform, then certain information may be visible to other BoardOnTrack members, including your name, address, organization information, and links to your professional and personal online sites.</p>
<p>You can control the information that is visible on the BoardOnTrack Platform by adjusting the information and settings in your member account under “Settings”. And you can control the information that is visible on the BoardOnTrack Community in your Community profile. We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your personal information, or any other information, on the Platform, Community forum, or Website.</p>
