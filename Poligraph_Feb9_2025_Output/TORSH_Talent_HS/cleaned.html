				<h2>TORSH Talent Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>
					Torsh Inc. takes your privacy very seriously and we figure that you do too.  Because we believe so strongly that the information you share with us is private and should remain so, we’ve decided to lay out exactly what you can expect from us when it comes to safeguarding the privacy of your information.  Torsh TALENT does not offer information intended to attract children, and as a result we do not knowingly solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16.
				</p>

				<h5>Information Collection And Use</h5>
				<p>
					While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as, your name, title, phone number, email address, or mailing address.   Our goal is to provide you with a unique and secure experience when using Torsh TALENT and as such we do need some personal information to make that happen.  We will retain personally identifiable information for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or as required by the law.   Here are some of the things we do with your information in order to provide you with a customized experience:

				<h5>Uploaded Videos and Supporting Documents</h5>
				<p>
					The videos and supporting documentation that you upload to Torsh TALENT are private to you unless you share them with others. We want you to know that no colleague, mentor, coach, supervisor or admin will see any of the videos or documents you upload UNLESS you share it with them.  After you share a video or document with a colleague, mentor, coach, supervisor or admin, he/she cannot share that video with anyone else unless you give them permission to do so.   Additionally, he/she cannot download or copy your video unless you give them permission to do so.  Your video and documents are 100% private to you until you share it.
				</p>

				<h5>Log Data</h5>
				<p>
					Like many sites, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site.  This log data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.
				</p>

				<h5>Security</h5>
				<p>
					The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
				</p>

				<h5>Third Parties With Whom We Share Information</h5>
				<p>
					We may share your information with third parties who assist with delivery of our products and services.  From time to time, we may share your information with the following third parties and to the extent possible, we encourage you to review their privacy policies and terms of use to see how they treat the information we share with them: Zendesk (<a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">ZenDesk Privacy Policy</a> ) ; Google (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>); Atlas (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Atlas Privacy Policy</a>); Zoom (<a href="https://zoom.us/privacy" target="_blank">Zoom Privacy Policy</a>); Amazon (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/" target="_blank">Amazon Privacy Policy</a>).
				</p>

				<h5>Cookies</h5>
				<p>
					Cookies are files that your Web browser puts on your computer when you visit a Web site.  We use cookies to tell us how often you visit our site, and what pages you go to on our site. Sometimes we use files from other companies (called third-party cookies) to help us see where people go on our website.  Unless you give us permission, the cookies we use do not store any personally identifying information.
				</p>

				<h5>Legal Disputes</h5>
				<p>
					The laws of the State of Louisiana will govern this Agreement, as well as any claim that we may have against each other. If we end up in court, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction, and that venue is proper in any court located in New Orleans, LA.
				</p>

				<h5>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h5>
				<p>
					We may change this privacy policy from time to time in our sole discretion without notice to you by updating this posting. You should periodically review this privacy policy carefully in order to inform you of the most current terms and conditions for the use of the Site.
