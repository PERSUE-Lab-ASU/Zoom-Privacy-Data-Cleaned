    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
 
 <p>BY USING OR ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
</p>
 

<h3>About Our Company</h3>
<p>Kaiser Ridge, Inc. ("<strong>GReminders</strong>") ("us", "we", or "our") operates the greminders.com website (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").</p>

<h3>Understanding Our Website</h3>
<p>GReminders is a website that provides both general information about Our company, products and services as well as a portal through which the Authorized Users of Subscribers access the GReminders SaaS Services. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>About this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Our Privacy Policy tells you (i) what information We may collect from you, (ii) how We may use and/or share that information, and (iii) how you can limit Our collection, use and sharing of Your information. &nbsp;The term “information” includes both “Non-Personal Information” (NPI) and “Personally Identifiable Information” (PII), as are more fully defined and described in this Privacy Policy.</p>  
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to (i) individuals who visit Our Website (“Visitors”), (ii) individuals who login to use the Services as Authorized Users of Subscribers (“Authorized Users”), and (iii) individuals that signup for our newsletter, request information, order products or services, fill out a “Contact Us” request or otherwise provide us with information (“Registered Users”).  Visitors, Authorized Users and Registered Users collectively are referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Users” or “You” or “Your”.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Our Website located at https://www.greminders.com, including other media forms, media channels, mobile website or mobile application related or connected thereto (collectively, “Website”) and the GReminders software as a service (“Services”) that are accessed by Authorized Users.  Capitalized terms shall have the meanings and definitions as set forth throughout this document or as defined in the Definitions section at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
<p>GReminders values the privacy of Users of Our Website and Services and We are committed to protecting your privacy interests.  We limit the collection of personal information to those items necessary to fulfill the purposes identified below. If We use Your information in a manner different than the purpose for which it is collected, then We will ask You for your consent prior to such use. This Privacy Policy is designed to inform You about the types of information that We may gather about or collect from You in connection with Your use of the Website and Services. It also is intended to explain the conditions under which We use and disclose that information, and Your rights in relation to that information. Changes to this Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document. Each time You use the Website, however, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, each time You use the Website You should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the beginning of this document) and review any changes since the last time You used the Website.</p>
<p>The Website is hosted in the United States of America and is subject to U.S. state and federal law. If You are accessing Our Website from other jurisdictions, please be advised that You are transferring Your personal information to us in the United States, and by using Our Website, You consent to that transfer and use of Your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You also agree to abide by the applicable laws of applicable states and U.S. federal law concerning Your use of the Website and Your agreements with us. Any persons accessing Our Website from any jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing the use of the Internet, including personal data collection, use and disclosure, different from those of the jurisdictions mentioned above may only use the Website in a manner lawful in their jurisdiction. If Your use of the Website would be unlawful in Your jurisdiction, please do not use the Website.</p> 

<h3>GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h3>
<h3>Visitors and Users of the Website Generally</h3>
<p>“Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person. “Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person. Like most website operators, We gather from Users of the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the User’sInternet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible for Us to determine from an IP address a User’s Internet service provider and the geographic location of the User’spoint of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. We analyze Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Users of the Website to help Us better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, We are able to better design the Website to improve Your experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use.  From time to time, We may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</p>
<h3>Web Cookies</h3>
<p>A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns You a unique identification that a website stores on a User’s computer, and that the User’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of services You have used, to record registration information regarding Your login name and password, to record Your User preferences, and to keep You logged into the Website. Company also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that Users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve Users’ experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Users of the Website, Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. GReminders USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p> 
<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
<p>A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually invisible to the User and allows website operators to check whether a User has viewed a particular web page or an email.  We may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count Users who have visited particular pages or viewed emails. Web Beacons are not used to access Users’ Personally-Identifying Information. They are a technique We may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides.  You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying Your browser setting to notify You each time a Web Cookie is tendered, permitting You to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) 
together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on Your past activity on the Website, including Google Analytics for Display Advertising. 
The information collected may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. 
If You do not want any information to be collected and used by Google Analytics, You can install an 
<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opt-out in Your web browser</a> 
and/or opt out from Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network by using 
<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google’s Ads Settings</a>.</p>
<h3>Aggregated and Non-Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>We may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information We collect under any of the above circumstances.  
We may also share it with third parties and Our affiliate companies to develop and deliver targeted information on the 
Website and on websites of third parties.  
We may combine Non-Personally Identifying Information We collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying Information collected from other sources.  
We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. 
For example, We may tell Our investors the number of visitors to the Website and the most popular features or services accessed.  
This information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and may be used to develop website content and services that 
We hope You and other Users will find of interest and to target content.</p> 
<h3>SOCIAL MEDIA&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect You to a social network if You click on the respective link. However, when You click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social network’s plugin will be activated and Your browser will directly connect to that provider’s servers. If You do not use these buttons, none of Your data will be sent to the respective social network’s plugin provider. So for example, when You click on the Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website, Facebook will receive Your IP address, the browser version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device You have used to access the Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks and are not within Our control.</p>
<p><strong>For Authorized Users of GReminders SaaS Services Only:</strong>  We may provide You the option to connect Your account on the Website to Your account on some social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling certain features on the Services.  We may collect the Personally-Identifying Information You have made publicly available on the social networking site, such as Your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friends network, age range, locale, friend list and any other information You have made public. By connecting Your account on the Website to Your account on any social networking site, You consent to the continuous release of information about You to Us. We will not send any of Your account information to the connected social networking site. Each social network may further allow You to set privacy controls around Your information on their system, and Our collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the available features and shared information are subject to change without notice to You</p>

<p>After You login to the Services, Authorized Users may be allowed to login to and access their personal social networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, Google+, etc.) (“Third Party Account”) and import Data into their GReminders account. &nbsp;By logging in to third Party sites from the Services, Users acknowledge they are entitled to disclose their Third-Party Account login information to Us and/or grant Us access to such Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein) without breach by You of any of the terms and conditions that govern Your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Us to pay any fees or making Us subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-Party service providers. &nbsp;By granting Us access to any Third-Party Accounts, You understand that We may access, make available and store (if applicable) any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Services that User has provided to and stored in such Third-Party Account so that it is available on and through the Website and Services. &nbsp;Depending on the Third-Party Accounts, Users choose, and subject to the privacy settings that a User has set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information contained in such Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through a User’s account on the Website and Services.  Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Service Provider’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-Party service provider, then data from such Third-Party Account may no longer be available on and through the Services. &nbsp;Users have the ability to disable the connection between Your User account and the Third-Party Accounts at any time. PLEASE NOTE THAT USER’SRELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTED THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY THE USER AGREEMENT(S), TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND PRIVACY POLICY ESTABLISHED BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS. &nbsp;We make no effort to review any data received from such Third-Party Accounts for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or noninfringement, and We are not responsible for any data contained in or received from such Third-Party Accounts.</p>
<h3>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h3>
<h3>Website Registration</h3>
<p>Website registration applies both to Authorized Users that login to access the GReminders SaaS Services as well as Visitors that register to receive newsletters, public updates and information, to complete a “Contact Us” request or for other purposes.  As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person.  We may collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website Users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected is information provided by users themselves when (1) registering on Our Website, (2) logging in to access the Services, (3) logging in with social network credentials, (4) participating in polls, contests, surveys or other features of Our Website, (5) or responding to offer or advertisements, (6) communicating with us, (7) creating a public profile or (8) signing up to receive newsletters. That information may include each User’s name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if You transact business with us, financial information such as Your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about Your interests and activities, Your gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic or relevant information as determined by Company from time to time. Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide Company with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a User’s refusal to do so may prevent the User from using certain Website features.</p>
<p>BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS “COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION” SECTION.</p>
<h3>Online Postings</h3>
<p>Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users may be disclosed as a matter of course as a result of Your use of the Website.  We may provide areas on the Website where You can post reviews and other information relating to Your activities on the Website.  Such postings are governed by Our&nbsp;Terms of Use.  In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of Your posting.  Also, whenever You voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.  For example, if You post Your email address, You may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads Your posting or what other Users may do with the information You voluntarily post, so We encourage You to exercise discretion and caution with respect to Your personal information. USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM THEIR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.</p>
<h3>Company Communications</h3>
<p>We may occasionally use Your name and email address to send You notifications regarding new products, services or information made available by Company that We think You may find valuable.  We may also send You service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.  Generally, You may opt out of such emails at the time of registration or through Your account settings, though We reserve the right to send You notices about Your account, such as service announcements and administrative messages, even if You opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<h3>Company Disclosures</h3>
<p>Company will disclose Personally-Identifying Information under the following circumstances:</p> 
<ul>

<h3>Limited Use Disclosure</h3>
<p>GReminders's use and transfer of information received from 
Google APIs to any other app will adhere to 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, 
including the Limited Use requirements.
</p>


<h3>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES GENERALLY</h3>
<p>Company contractually prohibits its contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers from disclosing Personally-Identifying Information received from Company, other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that Users provide directly to those third parties, or that those third parties collect for themselves. These third parties include advertisers, providers of games, utilities, widgets and a variety of other third-party applications accessible through the Website. Company neither owns nor controls the third-party websites and applications accessible through the Website. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third party, or using a third-party application, whether by means of a link on the Website, directly through the Website or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any such third party, users should inform themselves of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website or application, and should take those steps necessary to, in those users’ discretion, protect their privacy.</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>How long we retain your Personal Data depends on the type of data and the purpose for which we process the data. 
We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice 
unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>


<h3>Your Rights to Your Information</h3>
<p>We strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right to Know. You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li>
<li>Right of Access. This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li>
<li>Right to Correction. You have the right to request correction of your personal information.</li>
<li>Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”. This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. 
Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using GReminders because the application may then no longer work. 
In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li>

<li>Right to Complain. You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.</li>
<li>Right to Restrict Processing. This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information.</li>
<li>Right to Object. You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li>
<li>Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making. You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>
<li>Right to Non-Discrimination. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li>
<li>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at privacy@greminders.com or at Kaiser Ridge, Inc., 360 E. 1st Street #506 Tustin, CA 92780.

<h3>California Resident Rights</h3>

<p>If you are a California resident, you have the rights outlined in this section. If you are a California resident 
and there are conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Policy, the portion that is more 
protective of your Personal Data shall control. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the 
following applies to you, please email privacy@greminders.com.</p>

<p><strong>Access.</strong> You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of 
your Personal Data over the past 12 months. We will provide you with the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you;</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected;</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data;</li>
<li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
<li>If we have disclosed your Personal Data for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of 
Personal Data shared with each category of third-party recipient.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Deletion.</strong> You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected from you. 
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), this right is subject to certain exceptions. For example, we may 
need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. 
If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.</p>

<p><strong>Exercising Your Rights.</strong> To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request that (1) 
provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data 
(this will require you to send an email from the account in question or login credentials), and (2) describes your request 
in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Each request that meets both criteria will be 
considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data 
provided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>

<p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request 
unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, 
we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>

<p>You may submit a Valid Request by emailing privacy@greminders.com.</p>

<p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, 
you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to do, and we may request a copy of this written permission 
from your Authorized Agent when they make a request to exercise your rights on your behalf.</p>

<h4>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</h4>

<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, 
charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. 
However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with 
varying prices, rates, or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.</p>




<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<p>We take the security of Your Personally-Identifying Information seriously and use reasonable electronic, personnel and physical measures to protect it from loss, theft, alteration or misuse.&nbsp; However, please be advised that even the best security measures cannot fully eliminate all risks. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view Your information. We are not responsible for third-party circumvention of any&nbsp;privacy settings&nbsp;or security measures.</p>

We follow the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  
Under COPPA, children that are 13 years and older may provide us with information without a parent’s

 they cannot legally enter into contracts without a parent’s or legal guardian’s permission.</p> 

<p>Individuals under the age of 13 are only permitted to use our Services if they have created an account under 
the supervision of their parent, guardian, or a school educator. Any usage of our Services by individuals 
under 13 without this supervision is strictly prohibited. If you are a school or educator in the United States 
and intend for your students to utilize our Services, it is your responsibility to ensure compliance with

along with its associated regulations (collectively referred to as “COPPA”).</p>

<p>Even though our Website is not designed for use by anyone under the age of 13 (Child), 
we realize that a Child may attempt to access our Website. We do not knowingly collect PII from a Child. 
If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child is using our Website, please contact us. 
We may ask for proof of identification before we remove any information to prevent malicious removal 
of account information. If we discover on our own that a Child is accessing our Website, 
we will delete the information as soon as we discover it, we will not use the information for any purpose, 
and we will not disclose the information to third parties. You acknowledge that we do not verify the age 
of our users nor do we have any liability to do so. If you are a Child, please seek the permission of a parent 
or guardian before accessing our Website.</p>
