In exceptional cases, especially due to the complexity of your request, we are entitled to extend this period by another two months. We will, of course, inform you of any such extension and its justification.</p> <p> Further, you have a right to file a complaint to the data protection authority, as described below.</p> <ol start="19"> <li> <p> <strong>Right of access</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> You may have the right to obtain from us a confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to your personal data. The information about personal data processing includes the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipient to whom your personal data have been or will be disclosed, etc. However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right of access. Further, you may have the right to obtain a copy of your personal data undergoing processing. For additional copies requested, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.</p> <ol start="20"> <li> <p> <strong>Right to withdraw your consent</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> You may have the right to withdraw your consent given to us for some specific purposes at any time. You can do this on our website or by contacting us. However, withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of data processing prior such withdrawal.</p> <ol start="21"> <li> <p> <strong>Right to rectification</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> You may have the right to obtain from us the rectification of inaccurate personal data. Depending on the purposes of the processing, you may have the right to have incomplete personal data made complete, in particular by providing a supplementary statement.</p> <ol start="22"> <li> <p> <strong>Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> In some cases you have the right to have your private data erased. We will erase your personal data without undue delay if any of the following grounds apply:</p> <ol> <li> <p> we no longer need your personal data for the purposes for which we processed it, </p> </li> <li> <p> you exercise your right to object to processing (see the \"Right to object to processing\" section below) regarding the personal data we process based on our legitimate interests, and we find that we no longer have any such legitimate interests that would justify such processing, or </p> </li> <li> <p> it appears that our processing of personal data has ceased to comply with generally binding regulations. </p> </li> </ol> <p> This right does not apply if the processing of your personal data is still necessary for:</p> <ol> <li> <p> fulfilling our legal obligations, </p> </li> <li> <p> the purposes of archiving, scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes, or </p> </li> <li> <p> the establishment, exercise or defense of our legal claims. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Right to a restriction on processing</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> In some cases you may, in addition to the right to erasure, exercise the right to restriction of processing of personal data. This right allows you, in certain cases, to require that your personal data be flagged and that this data is not subjected to any further processing operations - in this case, however, not forever (as in the case of a right to erasure) but for a limited period of time. We have to restrict the processing of personal data when:</p> <ol> <li> <p> you contest the accuracy of personal data, until we agree on the correct data, </p> </li> <li> <p> we process your personal data without sufficient legal grounds (for example, beyond what we are obliged to process), however you would prefer merely restricting such data over erasure of such data (for example, if you expect in any event to provide us such data in the future), </p> </li> <li> <p> we no longer need your personal data for the above-mentioned purposes of processing, but you require it to establish, exercise or defend your legal claims, or </p> </li> <li> <p> you object to processing. The right to object is described in more detail below in the chapter entitled \"Right to object to processing\". For as long as we retain your data, if your claim is legitimate, we are obliged to limit the processing of your personal data. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Right to personal data portability</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> You have the right to obtain from us all personal data you have provided to us yourself and which we process on the basis of the performance of the contract. We will provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. In order to easily transmit the data at your request, it can only be data that we process by automated means in our electronic databases. We may not always be able to transmit to you in this form and in all circumstances all data we keep in paper form.</p> <ol start="23"> <li> <p> <strong>Right to object</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to object, on grounds relating to their particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data by us and we can be required to no longer process your personal data.</p> <ol start="24"> <li> <p> <strong>Filing a complaint</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> Furthermore, you may file a complaint related to the processing of your personal data with the competent data protection supervisory authority, i.e. our case with the authority of our main establishment in the Czech Republic the Office for Personal Data Protection, with its registeredoffice at Pplk.

This may include, among others, data about usage of the product and data about your communications within the product. The same applies when we provide our services to your organization.</p> <p> As a result, processing of your personal data within these products and services is determined by your organization and its privacy policy. If you have any questions about processing of your data within these products and services or would like to exercise any rights under the data protection legislation, please contact your organization.</p> <p> Detailed information about what data are processed in our products and in connection with provisions of our services is included below. Full specification of these products and services is available on our website.</p> <p> <strong>Processing of data in our products</strong></p> <p> Our products are either cloud-based, when the product is hosted on the infrastructure we provide, or on-premises, when the product is hosted or operated on the server or devices of your organization.</p> <p> When your organization uses cloud-based products or when we provide your organization with services, we only process your personal data to perform contract about provision of products to your organization, where we act as a processor to your organization in line with concluded data processing agreement.</p> <p> When your organization uses on-premises products, we have no access to your personal data at all and the whole processing is conducted by your organization as a data controller.</p> <p> We offer the following products:</p> <ol start="35"> <li> <p> <strong>IceWarp Suite</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> Our core product consists of combination of e-mail and communication platform (email, instant messaging, video conferencing), realtime chat and collaboration platform (TeamChat) and data storage platform (FileSync), available to users on the web (WebClient), desktop (Desktop Client) and mobile (IceWarp app). Together these products process the following data:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Identification data; </p> </li> <li> <p> Contact details; </p> </li> <li> <p> Products and services usage information, including metadata about entry of any data into these products, metadata about sending, receiving and viewing messages and files, searches made and keywords used etc.; </p> </li> <li> <p> any other data that are entered into, uploaded into or generated by these products, including content of any e-mails, messages, calendars, tasks, contact details, shared files etc. </p> </li> </ul> <ol start="36"> <li> <p> <strong>Desktop applications</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> Desktop applications (Desktop Client, TeamChat Desktop, Outlook Sync, Desktop Office apps) synchronize e-mails, calendars, contacts, tasks, notes, chat content and files with IceWarp. These products process the following data: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Identification data; </p> </li> <li> <p> Contact details; </p> </li> <li> <p> Products and services usage information, including metadata about entry of any data into these products, metadata about sending, receiving and viewing messages and files, searches made and keywords used etc.; </p> </li> <li> <p> any other data that are entered into, uploaded into or generated by these products, including content of any e-mails, messages, calendars, tasks, contact details, shared files etc. </p> </li> </ul> <ol start="37"> <li> <p> <strong>Mobile applications</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> Mobile applications process the same scope of data as their desktop counterparts, with a few specifics:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Products and services usage information may include metadata about the mobile device, phone number, IMEI, application diagnostics data, crash data and other telemetry data if you choose to provide feedback on your usage of the app; </p> </li> <li> <p> Products and services usage information may include metadata about authorizations and logins into applications (Authenticator app); </p> </li> <li> <p> Products and services usage information may include location data (IceChat app). </p> </li> <li> <p> any other data that are entered into, uploaded into or generated by these apps may include content stored on the device such as photos and files (IceChat app, IceWarp app). </p> </li> </ul> <p> <strong>Processing of data in our cloud micro</strong> <strong>-</strong> <strong>services</strong></p> <p> We also offer single-purpose cloud services called micro-services, which are hosted on infrastructure provided by IceWarp. Micro-services are available both to cloud and on-premise customers.</p> <p> In relation to the data processed on our infrastructure, we only process your personal data to perform contract about provision of products to your organization, where we act as a processor to your organization in line with concluded data processing agreement (applies to cloud customers and to on-premise customers using Recordings and Dashboard).</p> <p> In relation to the use of micro-services (other than Recordings and Dashboard) by on-premise customers, no data processing takes place as these micro-services act as a runtime environment only. All data remains stored on the server of your organization or devices provided by your organization.</p> <p> We offer the following micro-services:</p> <ol start="38"> <li> <p> <strong>Conferences</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> Our Conferences micro-service allows for secure video conferencing that runs in the browser, without installing anything on the user devices.

This micro-service processes the following data:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Identification data; </p> </li> <li> <p> Contact details; </p> </li> <li> <p> Products and services usage information, including metadata about entry of any data into this micro-service, metadata about any conferences held, metadata about sending, receiving and viewing messages etc.; </p> </li> <li> <p> any other data that are entered into, uploaded into or generated by this micro-service, including content of any conference calls, messages, shared files, shared screens etc. </p> </li> </ul> <ol start="39"> <li> <p> <strong>Recordings</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> Recordings micro-service allows for recording of any video conference held and storing it on our cloud. Any person making these recordings is responsible for further processing of these recordings, including the obligation to inform and obtain consent of meeting attendees with the fact that the conference session will be recorded, stored and/or disseminated.</p> <p> If your organization (user of our on-premise products or cloud services) selects to use Recordings micro-service and store them in the cloud, it becomes a party to data processing agreement of the storage provider for Recordings micro-service listed in Section F.</p> <ol start="40"> <li> <p> <strong>Documents</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> Our Documents micro-service allows creation, modification and sharing of documents, spreadsheets and presentations in the browser.

This allows to present a glanceable version of the document before the user opens it. Supported files are securely uploaded to the service, transformed into a thumbnail and deleted. This micro-service processes the following data: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Identification data; </p> </li> <li> <p> Contact details; </p> </li> <li> <p> Products and services usage information, including metadata about entry of any data into this micro-service, metadata about any files uploaded, metadata about the format of the original document and the resulting thumbnail; </p> </li> <li> <p> any other data that are entered into, uploaded into or generated by this micro-service, including content of any documents. </p> </li> </ul> <ol start="43"> <li> <p> <strong>Shortener</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> The Shortener service makes sharing files easier by providing a short version of a file's web address. The service stores original URL, the resulting short URL and each time the short link is accessed, it records the time and IP address used to access it, providing the user with file open statistics as well as geographical location of the file's recipient. This micro-service processes the following data:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Identification data; </p> </li> <li> <p> Contact details; </p> </li> <li> <p> IP Adress(es) used to access the short link; </p> </li> <li> <p> Identification of devices used to access the short link; </p> </li> <li> <p> Products and services usage information, including metadata about usage of this micro-service, metadata about any links shortened, metadata about the linked files; </p> </li> </ul> <ol start="44"> <li> <p> <strong>Dashboard</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> The Dashboard centralizes the most vital information for the user on a dedicated interactive panel. The micro-service stores and displays the user's Dashboard settings, background image and notes data. This micro-service processes the following data:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Identification data; </p> </li> <li> <p> Contact details; </p> </li> <li> <p> Notes; </p> </li> <li> <p> Pinnned items (files, teamchat threads, recordings and so on); </p> </li> <li> <p> Products and services usage information, including metadata about entry of any data into this micro-service, metadata about any pinned items, metadata about the user settings of the interface; </p> </li> <li> <p> any other data that are entered into, uploaded into or generated by this micro-service, including content of any documents. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <strong>Processing of data </strong> <strong>when providing</strong> <strong> </strong> <strong>professional </strong> <strong>services</strong></p> <p> When we provide our services, we in some cases need to process your personal data on behalf of your organization. </p> <p> In cases where we process data as a part of the service, i.e. in case of Migration service, where we process all the data that are migrated to or from our products, we act as a processor to your organization in line with concluded data processing agreement.</p> <p> In other cases, we have generally no access to data and do not process data as a part of the service, but provision of the service may result in an ad-hoc or incidental access to data. In these cases, we act as a person with access to personal data under the authority of the controller, i.e. your organization. This applies in case of our remaining services, i.e. Deployment, Upgrades, Trainings, Consulting, Health Check, Support (including SLA Subscription), Managed Services, Monitoring, Custom Development and Custom Services.</p> <ol start="45"> <li> <p> <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong> </p> </li> </ol> <p> This Privacy Policy is current as of January 2, 2023.
