Use  of data in our products  and services     If you use any product provided to you by your organization (for example, your employer), then this organization acts as a controller of your personal data and has full control over the product you use and your personal data within this product. This may include, among others, data about usage of the product and data about your communications within the product. The same applies when we provide our services to your organization.  As a result, processing of your personal data within these products and services is determined by your organization and its privacy policy. If you have any questions about processing of your data within these products and services or would like to exercise any rights under the data protection legislation, please contact your organization.  Detailed information about what data are processed in our products and in connection with provisions of our services is included below. Full specification of these products and services is available on our website.  Processing of data in our products  Our products are either cloud-based, when the product is hosted on the infrastructure we provide, or on-premises, when the product is hosted or operated on the server or devices of your organization.  When your organization uses cloud-based products or when we provide your organization with services, we only process your personal data to perform contract about provision of products to your organization, where we act as a processor to your organization in line with concluded data processing agreement.  When your organization uses on-premises products, we have no access to your personal data at all and the whole processing is conducted by your organization as a data controller.  We offer the following products:    IceWarp Suite     Our core product consists of combination of e-mail and communication platform (email, instant messaging, video conferencing), realtime chat and collaboration platform (TeamChat) and data storage platform (FileSync), available to users on the web (WebClient), desktop (Desktop Client) and mobile (IceWarp app). Together these products process the following data:    Identification data;     Contact details;     Products and services usage information, including metadata about entry of any data into these products, metadata about sending, receiving and viewing messages and files, searches made and keywords used etc.;     any other data that are entered into, uploaded into or generated by these products, including content of any e-mails, messages, calendars, tasks, contact details, shared files etc.       Desktop applications     Desktop applications (Desktop Client, TeamChat Desktop, Outlook Sync, Desktop Office apps) synchronize e-mails, calendars, contacts, tasks, notes, chat content and files with IceWarp. These products process the following data:     Identification data;     Contact details;     Products and services usage information, including metadata about entry of any data into these products, metadata about sending, receiving and viewing messages and files, searches made and keywords used etc.;     any other data that are entered into, uploaded into or generated by these products, including content of any e-mails, messages, calendars, tasks, contact details, shared files etc.       Mobile applications     Mobile applications process the same scope of data as their desktop counterparts, with a few specifics:    Products and services usage information may include metadata about the mobile device, phone number, IMEI, application diagnostics data, crash data and other telemetry data if you choose to provide feedback on your usage of the app;     Products and services usage information may include metadata about authorizations and logins into applications (Authenticator app);     Products and services usage information may include location data (IceChat app).     any other data that are entered into, uploaded into or generated by these apps may include content stored on the device such as photos and files (IceChat app, IceWarp app).     Processing of data in our cloud micro - services  We also offer single-purpose cloud services called micro-services, which are hosted on infrastructure provided by IceWarp. Micro-services are available both to cloud and on-premise customers.  In relation to the data processed on our infrastructure, we only process your personal data to perform contract about provision of products to your organization, where we act as a processor to your organization in line with concluded data processing agreement (applies to cloud customers and to on-premise customers using Recordings and Dashboard).  In relation to the use of micro-services (other than Recordings and Dashboard) by on-premise customers, no data processing takes place as these micro-services act as a runtime environment only. All data remains stored on the server of your organization or devices provided by your organization.  We offer the following micro-services:    Conferences     Our Conferences micro-service allows for secure video conferencing that runs in the browser, without installing anything on the user devices. Features like screensharing, real-time chat or password protection of meetings are included.

Any person making these recordings is responsible for further processing of these recordings, including the obligation to inform and obtain consent of meeting attendees with the fact that the conference session will be recorded, stored and/or disseminated.  If your organization (user of our on-premise products or cloud services) selects to use Recordings micro-service and store them in the cloud, it becomes a party to data processing agreement of the storage provider for Recordings micro-service listed in Section F.    Documents     Our Documents micro-service allows creation, modification and sharing of documents, spreadsheets and presentations in the browser.

Shortener     The Shortener service makes sharing files easier by providing a short version of a file's web address. The service stores original URL, the resulting short URL and each time the short link is accessed, it records the time and IP address used to access it, providing the user with file open statistics as well as geographical location of the file's recipient. This micro-service processes the following data:    Identification data;     Contact details;     IP Adress(es) used to access the short link;     Identification of devices used to access the short link;     Products and services usage information, including metadata about usage of this micro-service, metadata about any links shortened, metadata about the linked files;       Dashboard     The Dashboard centralizes the most vital information for the user on a dedicated interactive panel.

Processing of data  when providing   professional  services  When we provide our services, we in some cases need to process your personal data on behalf of your organization.   In cases where we process data as a part of the service, i.e. in case of Migration service, where we process all the data that are migrated to or from our products, we act as a processor to your organization in line with concluded data processing agreement.  In other cases, we have generally no access to data and do not process data as a part of the service, but provision of the service may result in an ad-hoc or incidental access to data. In these cases, we act as a person with access to personal data under the authority of the controller, i.e. your organization. This applies in case of our remaining services, i.e. Deployment, Upgrades, Trainings, Consulting, Health Check, Support (including SLA Subscription), Managed Services, Monitoring, Custom Development and Custom Services.
