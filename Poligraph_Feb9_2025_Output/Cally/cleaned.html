personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines how Cally, including its affiliated companies, collects, stores, utilizes,
and shares personal data concerning individuals (referred to as "you") who: (i) interact with our websites ("Visitors"),
accessible at www.cally.one or any other platform, webpage, email, text message, or online advertisement under our
administration (collectively referred to as "Sites"); (ii) utilize our SaaS platform, whether as end-users on behalf of
our corporate clients ("Users"; collectively with the Sites, the "Service").</p>
<p>We urge you to carefully review this Privacy Policy to fully comprehend and consent to its terms. If you do not agree
with this Privacy Policy, kindly refrain from using our Services.</p>
<p>You are not obligated by law to furnish us with any Personal Data (as defined below), and you may choose to do so, or
abstain from doing so, of your own volition.</p>
<p>If you opt not to provide us with such Personal Data or have it processed by us or any of our Service Providers (as
defined below), kindly refrain from accessing our Sites or utilizing our Service. Additionally, you have the option to
withhold "optional" Personal Data; however, please be aware that doing so may limit our ability to provide you with the
complete range of our services or the optimal user experience while using our Service.</p>
<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>We gather diverse forms of personal data pertaining to both our Users and Visitors to our Sites. This data is typically
acquired and produced through your interactions with us or our Service, through automated methods, directly from you,
from other Users, from our clients, or from other third parties (inclusive of Service Providers and “Cookies,” as later
defined).</p>
<p>Specifically, we accumulate the following categories of data (deemed as "Personal Data" to the extent it relates to an
identified or identifiable individual):</p>
<p><strong>Data Automatically Collected or Generated</strong>: When you engage with or utilize our Service, we may collect, log, or
generate certain technical data about you. This is done either independently or in collaboration with third-party
Service Providers (as defined in Section 4 below), utilizing tools like “cookies” and other tracking technologies (as
elaborated in Section 5 below). This data includes connectivity, technical, and aggregated usage data such as IP
addresses, approximate geographical locations, device specifications (like type, operating system, mobile device ID,
browser version, locale, and language settings), timestamps of usage, installed or utilized cookies and pixels, and
recorded activities (sessions, clicks, and other interactions) of Visitors and Users concerning our Service. Moreover,
phone calls (e.g., with our customer success or product consultants) may be automatically recorded, tracked, and
analyzed for purposes including analytics, service enhancement, operational efficiency, business quality control, and
record-keeping purposes.</p>
<p><strong>User Data Received from You</strong>: Upon contacting us, signing up for the Service, requesting a demo, or subscribing to
our Solution, you may furnish us with Personal Data such as your name, address, billing information, account login
details (email addresses hashed immediately upon receipt and passwords), and any images you choose to provide, along
with other data you opt to provide during your use of our Service or interactions with us. Additionally, when logged
into our Service, you may submit further details and documentation about yourself, including but not limited to employee
ID, job title, and other information aimed at optimizing your usage of the Service (collectively termed as “User Data”).
If you register for any of our events, you may provide additional details such as eligibility, preferences, experience
related to Cally and its Solutions, meal or accommodation preferences, and other pertinent information. Furthermore, you
may provide us with additional information about your company or employer, such as billing details, business needs, and
preferences, which, if concerning a non-human entity, are not considered "Personal Data" and are not subject to this
Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>User Data Received from Our Customers and Users</strong>: Our customers and Users may supply us with contact details of their
employees, team members, and colleagues, facilitating our communication, invitations, or subscription of such
individuals as Users to our Service. Typically, this data includes names, phone numbers, and work email addresses.</p>
<p><strong>Data Received from Other Third Parties</strong>: We may receive Personal Data about you from various sources. For instance,
if you partake in an event, webinar, or promotion sponsored or participated in by us, we may receive your Personal Data
from the organizers. Additionally, we may obtain your contact and professional details (e.g., name, company, position,
contact details, and work position) from business partners, service providers, or through commonly used tools and
channels for business networking and exploration of potential opportunities, such as LinkedIn and other data sources.</p>
<p>It's noteworthy that we do not receive or retain passwords for any third-party services (although we may typically
require your API key for integration purposes).</p>
<p><strong>Data Obtained through Analytics Tools</strong>: We utilize analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics and Hotjar) to gather data
about the usage of our Sites and Service. These tools collect data such as the frequency of visits or usage of the Sites
or Service, specific pages visited, timing of visits, and the source of website, ad, or email referrals.</p>
<h2>Data Uses</h2>
<p>We utilize Personal Data for several essential purposes, including ensuring the performance of our Service, complying
with legal and contractual obligations, and advancing our legitimate interests in enhancing and refining our Service.
These legitimate interests include comprehending usage patterns of our Service and the effectiveness of our campaigns,
enabling more efficient resource allocation in marketing, advertising, and sales efforts, refining customer service and
technical support, and safeguarding the interests of our Users, customers, Visitors, and ourselves, as well as the
broader public and our Service.</p>
<p>If you reside in a jurisdiction where privacy laws necessitate "consent" as the primary or most appropriate legal basis
for processing Personal Data, your acceptance of this Privacy Policy will be considered as consent to process your
Personal Data for all purposes outlined herein. Should you wish to revoke this consent, please contact us via email at:
contact@cally.one.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Data Location &amp; Retention</h2>
<p><strong>Data Location</strong>: Your Personal Data is processed and stored by us and our authorized Service Providers in AWS servers
located in the US. Additionally, we may retain your Personal Data in other locations as necessary for the efficient
functioning and delivery of our Service, or as mandated by law. Cally's headquarters are situated in Israel, a
jurisdiction recognized by the European Commission for providing adequate protection for the Personal Data of EU Member
State residents.</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention</strong>: We will keep your Personal Data for a period deemed reasonably necessary to maintain and enhance our
relationship with you, deliver our Service and offerings, comply with legal and contractual obligations, and safeguard
against potential disputes. This includes adhering to laws governing log-keeping, records, and bookkeeping, ensuring we
have evidence of our relationship in the event of legal issues arising post-termination. Data retention will not exceed
7 years from termination of our relevant customer's engagement with us, in accordance with applicable law. Please note,
except as required by law or our agreements with you, we reserve the right to securely delete, anonymize, or restrict
access to your Personal Data at our discretion and without prior notice.</p>
<p>For inquiries regarding our data retention policy, please reach out to us via email at privacy@cally.ai.</p>
<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p><strong>Legal Compliance</strong>: In extraordinary circumstances, we may disclose or grant government and law enforcement officials
access to your Personal Data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, or similar legal requirement, or
to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we have a genuine belief that: (
a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b) disclosure is necessary in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or
take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such disclosure is
essential to protect the security or integrity of our products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may enlist selected third-party entities and individuals to provide services that complement
our own. These service providers encompass a range of functions including hosting and server co-location services,
communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), data and cyber security services, billing and payment processing
services, fraud detection and prevention services, web analytics, e-mail distribution, marketing and monitoring
services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and
enrichment services, social and advertising networks, content providers, e-mail, voicemails, support and customer
relationship management systems, and our legal, compliance, and financial advisors (collectively referred to as "Service
Providers"). These Service Providers may access your Personal Data based on their specific roles and purposes in
supporting and enhancing our Service, and are only permitted to utilize it for such limited purposes as outlined in our
agreements with them.</p>
<p>Our Service Providers are considered as ‘Data Processors’ when Cally acts as the ‘Data Controller’; and when Cally
operates as the Data Processor for our customer, the Service Provider is deemed our ‘Sub-Processor’ (further detailed in
Section 9 below).</p>
<p>Sharing Personal Data with our customers, their Users, and service providers: We may share your Personal Data with the
customer who owns the account to which you are linked as a User (including data and communications related to your
purchases). In such instances, sharing this data means that the Customer may access it on behalf of the customer, and
will be able to monitor, process, and analyze your Personal Data. It's important to note that Cally is not responsible
for nor does it control any further disclosure, use, or monitoring by or on behalf of the customer, who themselves acts
as the “Data Controller” of such data (as further described in Section 9 below).</p>
<p><strong>Protecting Rights and Safety</strong>: We may share your Personal Data with others if we genuinely believe that doing so will
help protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Cally, any of our Users or customers, or any members of the
general public.</p>
<p><strong>Cally Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies</strong>: We may share Personal Data internally within our group for the purposes
outlined in this Privacy Policy. Moreover, if Cally or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates undergoes any change in
control or ownership, including through merger, acquisition, or purchase of any of its assets, your Personal Data may be
shared with the parties involved in such an event. If we anticipate that such change in control might materially affect
your Personal Data stored with us, we will notify you of this event and the choices you may have via e-mail or prominent
notice on our Service.</p>
<p>For clarification, Cally may share your Personal Data in additional manners, subject to your explicit approval, or if we
are legally obliged to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal and anonymous. We may transfer,
share, or otherwise use non-personal data at our sole discretion and without further approval.</p>
<h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
<p>Our Sites and Service, including certain Service Providers, employ "cookies," anonymous identifiers, container tags, and
other technologies to facilitate the provision of our Service, ensure its proper functioning, analyze our performance
and marketing activities, and personalize your experience. These cookies and similar files or tags may also be
temporarily stored on your device. Some of these cookies and technologies are designed to remember Personal Data, such
as an IP address, previously provided by a User.</p>
<p>Please be aware that we do not alter our practices in response to a "Do Not Track" signal in the HTTP header from a
browser or mobile application. However, most browsers offer options to manage cookies, including the ability to accept
or reject them and instructions for their removal. You can configure most browsers to notify you upon receiving a
cookie, or you may choose to block cookies entirely through your browser settings.</p>
<p>A comprehensive list of the cookies and pixels utilized in our Services can be accessed in the Cookie section of your
browser while using our Services.</p>
<h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
<p>Our Sites and Service, including certain Service Providers, employ "cookies," anonymous identifiers, container tags, and
other technologies to facilitate the provision of our Service, ensure its proper functioning, analyze our performance
and marketing activities, and personalize your experience. These cookies and similar files or tags may also be
temporarily stored on your device. Some of these cookies and technologies are designed to remember Personal Data, such
as an IP address, previously provided by a User.</p>
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p><strong>Service Communications</strong>: We may reach out to you with essential information concerning our Service. This could
include notifications (via any available means) regarding updates or modifications to our Service, billing matters,
alterations in service, login attempts, or password reset notifications. Additionally, our customers and other Users
within the same account may also send you notifications, messages, and updates regarding their or your usage of the
Service. However, please note that certain service communications essential to your usage, such as password resets or
billing notices, cannot be opted out of.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Communications</strong>: We may also inform you about new features, supplementary offerings, events, special
opportunities, or any other information we believe our Users will find valuable. These notifications may be delivered
through any available contact methods (e.g., phone, mobile, or email), via the Service itself, or through our marketing
campaigns on various sites or platforms. We may choose to send promotional emails only to specific Users on our mailing
list, based on their known characteristics.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to receive marketing communications, you can inform Cally at any time by sending an email to
privacy@cally.ai, adjusting your communication preferences in your settings, or by following the "unsubscribe," "
stop," "opt-out," or "change email preferences" instructions included in the promotional communications you receive.</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>To safeguard the Personal Data entrusted to us, we implement industry-standard physical, procedural, and technical
security measures, including encryption where suitable. Nonetheless, it's important to acknowledge that despite our
security efforts, we cannot provide absolute assurance regarding the protection and security of any Personal Data stored
with us or with any third parties, as outlined in Section 4 above.</p>
<h2>Data Subject Rights</h2>
<p>If you wish to exercise your rights under applicable laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or
the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (to the extent they apply), including the right to request access to,
rectification or erasure of your Personal Data held with Cally, or to restrict or object to the processing of such
Personal Data, or to port such Personal Data, or the right to equal services and prices (to the extent available to you
under the applicable laws) – please reach out to us via email at: contact@cally.one. We will endeavor to respond
promptly and initiate the selection process within 72 hours upon authorization of deletion by the customer (if
applicable) and validation of the user's identity. Please note that certain information may take up to 30 days to be
deleted from our backup files. Additionally, certain information may not be anonymized or deleted if such deletion is
not reasonably feasible given the system's architecture.</p>
<p>Upon contacting us via email, we may provide guidance on how to independently fulfill your request through your settings
or may request additional information and documents, including certain Personal Data, to authenticate and validate your
identity and process your request. Any additional data collected for this purpose will be retained by us for legal
purposes (e.g., as evidence of the identity of the individual submitting the request), in accordance with Section 3
above.</p>
<p>If you have any requests or inquiries regarding Personal Data processed on behalf of our customers, please directly
contact the customers themselves (as they act as the “Data Controller” of such data – refer to Section 9).</p>
<h2>Data Controller &amp; Processor</h2>
<p>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, commonly differentiate between two primary
roles for parties involved in processing Personal Data: the “Data Controller” (or, under the CCPA, “business”), who
determines the purposes and methods of processing; and the “Data Processor” (or, under the CCPA, “service provider”),
who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller (or business).</p>
<p>Cally acts as the “Data Controller” of Personal Data concerning its Visitors and other business contacts at our
customers, as well as User Data comprising profile and contact details, usage data, preferences, engagement metrics,
analytics data, and data acquired from the Solution, which we utilize to enhance our algorithms and develop superior
services for our clients. In relation to such data, we bear the responsibilities of the Data Controller (solely to the
extent mandated by law), as outlined in this Privacy Policy. In these instances, our Service Providers processing such
data assume the role of “Data Processor”.</p>
<p>Any other Personal Data provided to our service will solely be processed by Cally on behalf of our customer, who is the
proprietor of the corresponding account, in conjunction with all other User Data processed on behalf of such customer.</p>
<p>In such scenarios, our customer is considered the “Data Controller” of such data, and Cally processes such data on
behalf of the customer as its “Data Processor”, in accordance with reasonable instructions and subject to applicable
agreements with the customer. Cally’s Service Providers act as designated Sub-Processors in these cases. Our customer is
responsible for fulfilling any legal obligations applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for
processing and addressing Data Subject Rights requests pertaining to the data they control).</p>
<h2>Additional</h2>
<p><strong>Updates and Amendments</strong>: We reserve the right to periodically update and amend this Privacy Policy by posting a
revised version on our Service. The revised version will become effective as of the date of publication. In the event of
material changes to these Terms, we will notify our customers as appropriate under the circumstances, such as by
displaying a prominent notice within the Service or sending an email. Your continued use of the Service following the
implementation of such changes will indicate your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
<p><strong>External Links</strong>: Although our Service may include links to other websites or services, we do not assume
responsibility for their privacy practices. We encourage you to exercise caution when leaving our Service for the
website or application of third parties and to review the privacy policies of each website and service you visit. Please
note that this Privacy Policy exclusively pertains to our Service.</p>
<p>Service for the website or application of such third parties, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website
and service you visit. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Service.</p>
<p>Our Service is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 16: We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from
children and do not seek to do so. If we become aware that a person under the age of 16 is utilizing the Service, we
will take measures to prevent and block such usage and will make every effort to promptly delete any associated Personal
Data stored by us. If you suspect that we may possess any such data, please contact us via email at contact@cally.one.</p>
<p><strong>Questions, Concerns, or Complaints</strong>: If you have any comments or inquiries regarding our Privacy Policy, or if you
have concerns regarding your Personal Data held by us, please reach out to us at contact@cally.one. If you are a
GDPR-protected individual, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU supervisory authority.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section class="relative pb-25 max-md:overflow-hidden max-md:pb-25"><div class="container relative max-md:text-center"><div class="absolute -bottom-[442px] left-1/2 -z-10  flex -translate-x-1/2 max-md:hidden max-md:flex-col"><div class="rounded-full bg-primary-200/20 blur-[145px]  max-1xl:h-[335px] max-1xl:w-[335px]  max-md:hidden 1xl:h-[442px] 1xl:w-[442px]"></div><div class="-ml-[170px] rounded-full  bg-primary-200/25 blur-[145px]  max-1xl:h-[335px] max-1xl:w-[335px] max-md:ml-0 1xl:h-[442px] 1xl:w-[442px]"></div><div class="-ml-[170px] rounded-full  bg-primary-200/20 blur-[145px]  max-1xl:h-[335px] max-1xl:w-[335px] max-md:ml-0 1xl:h-[442px] 1xl:w-[442px]"></div></div><div class="absolute -bottom-[350px] left-1/2 -z-10 h-full w-full -translate-x-1/2 bg-[url('/images/hero-gradient.png')]  bg-contain bg-center bg-no-repeat p-[350px] opacity-70 md:hidden"></div><div><div><p class="section-tagline">Install Now</p></div><div class="grid-y-10 grid grid-cols-12 items-start"><div class="max-md:col-span-full md:col-span-6 lg:col-span-7"><h2 class="mb-5 text-[48px] font-semibold max-lg:text-[32px] ">Start your free trial now!</h2><p>Install Cally into your Shopify store with just a few clicks.</p></div><div class="max-md:col-span-full max-md:mt-5 md:col-span-6 lg:col-span-5 "><form action="" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="POST"><input type="hidden" name="$ACTION_REF_1"><input type="hidden" name="$ACTION_1:0" value="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;19494b09442d453b13be86f00b6e39345d020b38&quot;,&quot;bound&quot;:&quot;$@1&quot;}"><input type="hidden" name="$ACTION_1:1" value="[&quot;$undefined&quot;]"><input type="hidden" name="$ACTION_KEY" value="k1031492304"><div class="grid grid-cols-12 items-center max-lg:gap-y-5 lg:gap-x-6 "><input type="text" placeholder="yourstore.myshopify.com" class="placeholder:text-light text-light h-full rounded-[60px] border border-borderColor  bg-transparent bg-white ps-5 leading-[1.75] text-[#A1A49D] outline-none transition-all duration-300 focus:border-primary focus:outline-none dark:border-[#31332F] dark:bg-dark-200 dark:placeholder:text-[#A1A49D] dark:focus:border-primary max-lg:col-span-full max-lg:py-3.5 lg:col-span-8" name="shop"><button class="btn max-lg:col-span-full lg:col-span-4">Get Started</button></div></form><ul class=" mt-6 flex items-center max-lg:justify-between max-lg:gap-y-2.5 max-md:flex-col lg:gap-5 "><li class="flex items-center"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="mr-3"><path d="M14.125 7.75L8.62497 13L5.875 10.375M19 10C19 14.9706 14.9706 19 10 19C5.02944 19 1 14.9706 1 10C1 5.02944 5.02944 1 10 1C14.9706 1 19 5.02944 19 10Z" stroke="" class="stroke-paragraph dark:stroke-primary" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p>7 Days Trial</p></li><li class="flex items-center"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="mr-3"><path d="M14.125 7.75L8.62497 13L5.875 10.375M19 10C19 14.9706 14.9706 19 10 19C5.02944 19 1 14.9706 1 10C1 5.02944 5.02944 1 10 1C14.9706 1 19 5.02944 19 10Z" stroke="" class="stroke-paragraph dark:stroke-primary" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p>Starting from $0 per month</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section></main><div class="Toastify"></div><next-route-announcer style="position: absolute;"></next-route-announcer></body></html>
