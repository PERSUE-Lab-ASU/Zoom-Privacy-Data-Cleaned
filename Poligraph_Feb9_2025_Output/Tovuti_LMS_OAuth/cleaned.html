<h3>Interest-Based Advertising.</h3>
<p>We may use information we collect (alone or in combination with information provided by third parties and service providers) to deliver targeted advertising (about The Company or other third-party products and services) to you when you visit our Website or other websites. Information about you (such as email address) as well as cookies and other tracking technologies (described above) may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, we may use that information to cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on that product.</p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please see the Opt-Out Process/Options and Additional Terms below.</p>
<h3>Data Retention.</h3>
<p>We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active (as determined by us) and for a reasonable time thereafter, or such other time period as prescribed by law. We also may retain your personal information for a longer period of time as needed to provide you services or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Even if we delete some or all of your personal information, we may continue to retain and use aggregate, anonymous data previously collected and/ or anonymize and aggregate your personal information.</p>
<h3>Updating personal Information.</h3>
<p>Upon request, we will permit you to request or make changes or updates to your Personal Information for legitimate purposes. We request identification prior to approving such requests. We reserve the right to decline any requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require unreasonable time or effort of our technical or administrative personnel, or undermine the privacy rights of others. We reserve the right to permit you to access your Personal Information in any account you establish with this site for purposes of making your own changes or updates, and in such case, instructions for making such changes or updates will be provided where necessary.</p>
<h3>Contests and Promotions.</h3>
<p>If contests or promotions are made available, the applicable contest or promotion rules may include rules regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. To the extent that those specific rules conflict with this Privacy Policy, the contest or promotion rules will supersede this Privacy Policy with respect to the conflicting terms and the non-conflicting terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use will continue to apply.</p>
<h3>Your Choices.</h3>
<p>We strive to offer you with choices about how information is used and shared. There are several ways in which you may opt out of the various programs and services we provide. Some of the ways in which you may opt out are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of Our Services.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If you receive a marketing email from us, you may unsubscribe from future marketing emails in accordance with our standard unsubscribe process.</p>
<p><strong>Interest-Based Advertising Opt-Out and Do Not Track Signals.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>With respect to “do not track” (a/k/a “DNT”) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers, the Website does not respond to or honor such signals or mechanisms. This means that third parties, such as ad networks, web analytics companies, and social networking platforms (some of whom are discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy), may collect information about your online activities over time and across our Website and other third-party online properties or services. These companies may use information about your visits to our Website and other sites, and general geographic information derived from your IP address, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, please visit http://www.networkadverDsing.org/choices/. This is a site offered by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) that includes information on how consumers can opt- out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of NAI's members. You can also visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices, which is a site offered by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) that includes information on how consumers can opt-out from receiving internet-based advertising from some or all of DAA's participating companies. Opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer see any advertisements; rather, you will still see advertisements that are general and not tailored to your specific interests and activities. Further, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.</p>
<p><strong>We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way.</strong></p>
<h3>Data Security.</h3>
<p>We will implement reasonable and appropriate security procedures consistent with prevailing industry standards to protect data from unauthorized access by physical and electronic intrusion. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of data storage can be guaranteed 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information by following generally accepted industry standards, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or archive at this site.</p>
<p>When you transmit Personal Information through our registration process or if you purchase products or services, we encrypt that information in transit using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We do not store your credit card information in our systems. All credit card transactions are processed using secure encryption - the same level of encryption used by leading banks. Card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely at gateways on a PCI-compliant network.</p>
<h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</h3>
<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of the Company or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.</p>
<h3>California “Shine the Light”.</h3>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine the Light”), California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship: (a) a list of the categories of personal information, as defined under Shine the Light, such as name, email address and mailing address and the type of services provided to the customer that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes; and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties. If you are a California resident: (i) to request the above information, or (ii) if you do not want your personal information shared with any third party who may use such information for direct marketing purposes and wish to opt out of such disclosures, please contact us by email at legal@tovutiteam.com.</p>
<p>Please note that under Shine the Light, we are not responsible for removing your personal information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your information, and any elections or privacy choices you may make with respect to receipt of certain types of e-mails or marketing communications from us will not apply to any such third parties. You should directly contact any third &nbsp;parties that send you communications regarding choices that they may make available to you concerning &nbsp;such communications.</p>
<h3>Nevada Privacy Rights.</h3>
<p>If you are a Nevada resident, you have the right to request that we do not sell your covered information (as those terms are defined in N.R.S. 603A) that we have collected, or may collect, from you. We do not sell your covered information, however, if you would like to make such a request you may do so by contacting us at (Contact Info)</p>
<h3>Your California Privacy Rights.</h3>
