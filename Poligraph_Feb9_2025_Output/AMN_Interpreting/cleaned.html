<p><strong>For employment purposes</strong>. We may use your information for recruitment and hiring, to staff open positions at our company or with clients, to provide payroll and administer benefits, for travel arrangements and performance management, for record-keeping, for safety purposes, to meet legal and compliance obligations, or for other internal purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Automated Decision Making</strong>. We use the data that we have about you to match you with opportunities that may result in successful placements with clients and other providers.
