      <div class="page-content">
        <p>By accessing the Site or using the Software, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy in its entirety.</p>
        <p>We collect information about you and how you use Swit.</p>
        <ul class="privacy-list">
          <li class="privacy-list__item">The information that we collect <strong>DOES NOT</strong> include anything from your Google or Outlook accounts (or any email accounts that you link with Swit), as that information is only stored locally on your computer.
          </li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">We will require access to your Google account(s) so that you can use, integrate, and link your Google account(s) with Swit in order to get the best experience from certain features of the Software. We do not collect or store any of your Google account information as this information is only stored locally on your computer.</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">We’ll send you emails about Swit and other stuff that may be of interest to you. You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time.
          </li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">We collect Anonymous Data and Application Data (as defined below) to make our website and Swit more useful to you.</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">If we do collect Personal Data (as defined below), we will only use this information for lawful purposes and will store and retain this information for as long as required by applicable law.</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">You can contact us any time to update or remove any Personal Data that we have collected and stored about you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thank you for visiting www.swit.io  (the “Site”). The Site is an Internet property of Swit Technologies Inc. and its affiliated companies (“Swit”, “our”, “we” or “us”). Swit is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe to you and to outline our practices and policies associated with any information (such as the Application Data, Anonymous Data, and Personal Data, each as defined below) that we may collect from you, or that you may share with us when you access or use the Site, use the Swit application (the “Software”), or use any related products and/or services.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-title">Applicability of this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to Swit’s online workplace productivity tools and platform, including the associated Swit mobile and desktop applications (collectively, the “Service”), Swit.io (the “Website”) and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, etc.) you may have with Swit. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Service, Website or any other aspect of Swit’s business.
          This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the service through the Swit platform (“Third Party Services”), or any other third party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Service (the “Customer Agreement”), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through service accounts (collectively, “Customer Data”). The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (“Customer”) controls their instance of the service (their “Workspace”) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have an account, you can check www.swit.io for contact information of your Workspace owner(s) and administrator(s). If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-title">How We Collect and Use Personal and Anonymous Data</h3>
        <p>When you access the Site, purchase, download trial or evaluation versions, register for any associated products and/or services, or use the Software in any way, we may collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you. We may also collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data when you send us information or communications.</p>
        <p>“Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example and without limitation:</p>
        <ul class="privacy-list">
          <li class="privacy-list__item">your name</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">geographic location or geolocation</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">credit card information (Paid Users Only)</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">email address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Personal Data may be used for the purposes of recording the transaction when you access the Site or when you use any of the Software or any associated products and/or services. Swit does not knowingly collect any sensitive personal data or any data defined under special categories of the applicable law(s).</p>
        <p>“Anonymous Data” refers to data about you that is not associated with, or linked to your Personal Data. Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. When you link third-party Accounts like Google or Outlook to the Software, nothing is collected from these accounts. As such, Personal Data and Anonymous Data expressly exclude any information that could be collected by way of linking your accounts. This data is only stored locally on your computer system and thus does not constitute any part of data that we collect. In most cases, Personal Data collection occurs when you provide such data directly to us, when you use the Software to connect your email address(es) or to access your event data, or if such information and data is required in order for us to provide the Software and related services to you.</p>
        <p>To make our website and Software more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect Personal Data, Anonymous Data, or Application Data from you such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, geolocation, domain name, Software usage and statistics, and/or a date/time stamp of your visit. We may also use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and referring URLs to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit. We may also use Personal Data and Anonymous Data for market research purposes and to improve our products, the Site, and the Software. We may share Anonymous Data with selected third parties and business partners, however, we will not share any Anonymous Data if such information is, contains, or will be linked to your Personal Data, unless we have given you notice, as described in this Privacy Policy, and you have given us authorization to do so. Swit will use Personal Data, IP addresses, and geolocation to identify users of the Site and Software if and when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site’s policies, or to protect our products, the Software, the Site, or other users of the Site and/or Software.</p>
        <p>We may use Personal Data collected from you for the following general purposes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>to fulfill your requests for our Software;</li>
          <li>to improve the Site and Software;</li>
          <li>to contact you to resolve problems;</li>
          <li>to send you information about the Software including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;</li>
          <li>to communicate with you about products and services offered by us and our selected partners;</li>
          <li>to engage with third-party service providers so that you can access and use the Software; and</li>
          <li>to periodically conduct product and market research regarding your use of the Software.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If and when we use a third-party payment processing merchant, third-party technical support provider, or third-party hosting provider, we ensure that the same privacy criteria, as defined herein, are in place with such third parties. </p>
        <p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. We will periodically send you newsletters and emails that directly promote the use of the Site or the purchase of our Software. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the email you receive, or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings from us, you may continue to receive future mailings from third parties that you have requested to receive information from. If you do not wish to receive future communications from third-party providers, you should notify them directly of your choice regarding their use of your Personal Data. To opt-out of having future third-party marketing communications sent to you, you will be required to unsubscribe with the applicable third-party providers. Despite your request to no longer receive future newsletters or promotional and marketing communications from us, we reserve the right to continue to send you notices of any updates to the Software, our Terms of Software, and our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">How We Use Data</h3>
        <p>Customer Data will be used by Swit in accordance with a Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of service functionality, and as required by applicable law. Swit is a processor of Customer Data and Customer is the controller. Customers may, for example, use the service to grant and remove access to a Workspace, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the service.
          Swit uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our service, Websites and business. More specifically, Swit uses Other Information:
        </p>
        <ul class="privacy-list">
          <li class="privacy-list__item">To provide, update, maintain and protect our service, Websites and business.This includes use of Other Information to support the delivery of the service under a Customer Agreement, prevent or address service errors, security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and other activities or at an Authorized User’s request.</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and questions. If you contact us, we may use your Other Information to respond.</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">To develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and additional features. Swit tries to make the service as useful as possible for specific Workspaces and Authorized Users. For example, we may improve search functionality by using Other Information to help determine and rank the relevance of content, channels or expertise to an Authorized User, make service suggestions based on historical use and predictive models, identify organizational trends and insights, to customize a service experience or create new productivity features and products.</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">To send emails and other communications. We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails, messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our service, our service offerings, and important service-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These communications are considered part of the service and you may not opt out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about Swit. These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">For billing, account management and other administrative matters. Swit may need to contact you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.</li>
          <li class="privacy-list__item">To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, Swit may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Data.”</p>
        <p>Personal data collected from Google APIs is used solely to provide or improve the features explicitly enabled by the user within the Swit application. Swit does not use Google user data for developing or training artificial intelligence models, advertising, or any purpose beyond those directly related to the application’s functionality.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-title">Data Retention</h3>
        <p>
          Swit will retain Customer Data in accordance with Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of service functionality, and as required by applicable law. Depending on the service tier, Customer may be able to customize its retention settings and apply those customized settings at the Workspace level, channel level or other level. Customers may also apply different settings to messages, files or other types of Customer Data. The deletion of Customer Data and other use of the service by Customer may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of certain associated Other Information. For more detail, please review the Help Center or contact Customer Success. Swit may retain Other Information pertaining to you for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This may include keeping your Other Information after you have deactivated your account for the period of time needed for Swit to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">How we store and secure information we collect</h3>
        <p class="sub-p"><strong>Information storage and security</strong></p>
        <p>We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store. For more information on where and how we store your information, please contact help@swit.io.<br>
          While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.<br>
          If you use our Services, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Swit. We strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of data transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p"><strong>How long we keep information</strong></p>
        <p class="sub-p">How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information immediately.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">Account information: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided, but when requested with the applicable format of writing (provided by Swit help center when requested), details that can identify you will be removed. </p>
        <p class="sub-p">Managed accounts: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for six weeks from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Swit account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time, as deemed by Swit, from the date such information was created.</p>

        <p class="sub-p"><strong>How to access and control your information</strong></p>
        <p>You have certain choices available when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations. The summary introduces some, not all, choices that are available to you in accessing and controlling your information.</p>
        <p>Your Choices: <br>
          You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. For all requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance until further control system is implemented in the Services.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p"><strong>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases</strong>: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>
        <p class="sub-p"><strong>Access and update your information</strong>
          : Our Services and related documentation (see Data Request policy) give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using Integrated Search in the Service (if applicable). You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p"><strong>Deactivate your account</strong>
          : If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account. If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact the appropriate support team (see the Help Center on Website). Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services. For more information on how to delete your information, see below.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p"><strong>Delete your information</strong>
          : Our Services and related documentation (see the Help Center) give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the Integrated Search and editing tools associated with that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p"><strong>Request that we stop using your information</strong>
          : In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Third-party Relationships</h3>
        <p class="sub-p">
          <strong>Third-party Links. </strong>
          The Site and the Software may contain links to other third-party owned and/or operated websites and, where you request information from third-party providers, we may transfer you directly to the websites of such third-party providers. Swit is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party websites. In some cases, you may be required to provide certain information to register or complete a transaction at such website.

        <p>Accounts are added to the Software using OAuth authentication.

If you remove an account, or uninstall the Software, you’ll be prompted to re-authorize the Software for each Google or Outlook Account using OAuth.</p>
        <p>We only use the authorization to support certain Software features like unread email count for each account, and to support push desktop notifications if requested. This information is local, and not stored on, or transmitted to, our servers.</p>
        <p>The Software will require access to your Google account(s) and user data for the following purposes:</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Security</h3>
        <p>Swit takes security of data very seriously. Swit works hard to protect Other Information you provide from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the Other Information we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology. Swit has applied or is in tier to apply for internationally recognized security certifications including, but not limited to, ISO 27001 (information security management system) and ISO 27018 (for protecting personal data in the cloud). Given the nature of communications and information processing technology, Swit cannot guarantee that Information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Registration</h3>
        <p>
          In order to use the Service, You must have a valid Account. To acquire an Account for the Service, You must provide Swit with an electronic mail address and other information ("Registration Data"). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the access data for Your Account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under Your Account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Swit of any unauthorized use of Your Account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that You exit from Your Account at the end of each session. Swit cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from Your failure to comply with this section. In consideration of use of the Service, You agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about Yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form, and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. Swit assumes no duty to verify such information as further detailed in the CONTENT OF THE SERVICE section of these Terms of Service. If You provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Swit has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Swit has the right to suspend or terminate Your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). By using the Service (and registering an Account on the Service), You represent and warrant that You are at least 16 years of age, and no one under the age of 16 may use the Service - Swit may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms of Service are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you and the right to access the Service is revoked where these Terms of Service or use of the Service is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale or provision of the Service conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Underage Use of Swit</h3>
        <p>
          Swit does not discriminate its Service by age, race, color, national origin, sex, and religion, and therefore assume that any use by persons legally defined as a minor is done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or persons with authorized rights of the minors’ overall wellbeing. Swit relies on these authorized figures to ensure that minors have been thoroughly informed and educated of the rights and responsibilities as laid out in these Terms of Service and in our Privacy Policy, and any legal liabilities arising from the use of these minors fall on their above-mentioned authorized figures, not Swit.
          In the event that you are an educational institution and want your students, who are, again, legally defined as minors, to use the Service - you agree that you are responsible for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and, to the extent applicable, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). This means that you must notify the students' parents/guardians of Swit’s collection of students’ personally identifiable information, and that you have obtained parental/guardian consent before your students establish accounts or use Swit. When obtaining such consent, you agree that you have provided the parents/guardians a copy of Swit’s Privacy Policy. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them for any legal or nonlegal reasons. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission's website. If you are located outside of the United States, Swit assumes that any legal liabilities of these minors lie on their parents or authorized guardians under similar laws and legal clauses that Swit deems as legally applicable.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>

Laws, regulations and industry standards evolve and may make such changes necessary. In case of changes to our Privacy Policy, Swit will post the changes to this page and encourage you to review it to stay informed. If we make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, Swit will provide additional notice, such as via email or through the Service. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you agree to all future iterations of the terms unless you have been notified otherwise. If you disagree with the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should deactivate your service account. Contact the Customer Success if you wish to request the removal of Personal Data.

        <h3 class="sub-title">International Data Transfers Privacy Shield And Contractual Terms</h3>
        <p>
          Swit may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than the one in which you signed up for the Service. We may transfer, process and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services. International transfers within the Swit Technologies: To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information globally and allow access to that information from countries in which the Swit owned or operated companies for the purposes described in this policy. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are based. In any case Swit needs to seek a governmental authority for international transfers of information within Swit companies and third parties, we make use of standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Your Rights</h3>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>
          This section provides additional details about the personal information we collect about California consumers and the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA.”
          For more details about the personal information we have collected over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see the How We Share and Disclose Information section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How We Share Information section above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the How We Share and Disclose Information section above. Swit does not sell (as such term is defined in the CCPA) the personal information we collect (and will not sell it without providing a right to opt out). Please note that we do use third-party cookies for our advertising purposes as further described in our Cookie information under “Information We Collected And Receive.”
          Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of personal information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information), to delete their personal information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. California consumers may make a request pursuant to their rights under the CCPA by contacting us at help@swit.io.

Consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf.

        <h3 class="sub-title">Data Protection Authority</h3>
        <p>
          We are the Controller of our Visitors’ and Customers’ Personal Data, and certain types of User Data; we are the Processor of any Personal Data contained in Customer Data, and of User Data processed on behalf of our Customer.
          Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the “Data Controller” (or under the CCPA, “business”), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “Data Processor” (or under the CCPA, “service provider”), who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Service, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.
          Swit is the “Data Controller” of its Visitors’ and Customers’ Personal Data, as well as User Data consisting of profile and contact details, as well as usage, preferences, engagement and analytics data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of “Data Processor”.
          If any of our Users upload or submit Customer Data or other content to our Service which includes Personal Data (e.g., by submitting their own clients’ contact details to one of their Boards), such data will only be processed by Swit on behalf of our Customer, which is the owner of the respective Account, along with all other User Data processed on such Customer’s behalf.
          In such instances, our Customer shall be deemed the “Data Controller” of such data, and Swit will process such data on the Customer’s behalf, as its “Data Processor”, in accordance with its reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms, our Data Processing Agreement with such Customer (to the extent applicable) and other commercial agreements. Swit’s Service Providers shall act as designated Sub-Processors in these instances. The Customer will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).
        </p>
