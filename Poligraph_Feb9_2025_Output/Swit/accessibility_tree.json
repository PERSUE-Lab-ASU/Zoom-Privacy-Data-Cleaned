Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201cData Controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cData Processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Service, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply. Swit is the \u201cData Controller\u201d of its Visitors\u2019 and Customers\u2019 Personal Data, as well as User Data consisting of profile and contact details, as well as usage, preferences, engagement and analytics data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cData Processor\u201d. If any of our Users upload or submit Customer Data or other content to our Service which includes Personal Data (e.g., by submitting their own clients\u2019 contact details to one of their Boards), such data will only be processed by Swit on behalf of our Customer, which is the owner of the respective Account, along with all other User Data processed on such Customer\u2019s behalf. In such instances, our Customer shall be deemed the \u201cData Controller\u201d of such data, and Swit will process such data on the Customer\u2019s behalf, as its \u201cData Processor\u201d, in accordance with its reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms, our Data Processing Agreement with such Customer (to the extent applicable) and other commercial agreements. Swit\u2019s Service Providers shall act as designated Sub-Processors in these instances. The Customer will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).
