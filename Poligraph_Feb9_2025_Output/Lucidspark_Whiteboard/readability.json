We only rely on this legal basis when our or a third party\u2019s legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights and interests.</li><li><strong>Compliance with a Legal Obligation</strong>. We have a legal obligation to use your personal information, for example to comply with tax and accounting obligations.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Your Rights</h3><p>You have certain rights and protections regarding the processing of your personal information. Unless otherwise provided under applicable law, you have the following rights:</p><ul><li id=\"isPasted\"><strong>Access and Portability</strong>. You may ask us to provide you with a copy of the personal information we maintain about you, including a machine-readable copy of the personal information that you have directly provided to us, and request information about its processing.</li><li><strong>Rectification and Deletion</strong>. You may ask us to update and correct inaccuracies in your personal information, or to have the information anonymized or deleted, as appropriate.</li><li><strong>Restriction and Objection</strong>. You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or object to such processing.</li><li><strong>Consent Withdrawal</strong>. You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us regarding the processing of your personal information, at any time and free of charge. We will apply your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you withdraw your consent.</li><li id=\"isPasted\"><strong>Limitation of Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</strong>. If personal information covered by this Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal information was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal information so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of personal information should be sent to us as specified in the \u201cContact Us\u201d section below. Certain personal information, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, is considered \u201cSensitive Personal Information.\u201d To the extent we collect it, we will not use Sensitive Personal Information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual unless we have received your affirmative and explicit consent (opt in).</li></ul><p>You may exercise your rights by following the instructions under \u201cYour Choices\u201d above, or by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this Policy. Before fulfilling your request, we may ask you to provide reasonable information to verify your identity. Please note that there are exceptions and limitations to each of these rights, and that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain personal information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. In addition, certain choices may make it impossible to provide the Services. For instance, if you ask us to delete all your personal information and no exception applies, we will no longer be able to provide the Services since certain personal information, such as an email address, are needed to provide the Services. We will inform you when you will need to permanently delete your account in order to satisfy a request you have made.&nbsp;</p><h3>Questions or Complaints&nbsp;</h3><p>If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, and have a concern about our processing of personal information, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, including in your country of residence, place of work, or where an incident took place.</p></div><section id=\"otnotice-section-b44c6377-11d1-4b4c-9699-ab8ccb0932e0\"><p>You can update your account and profile information or delete your account through your account settings.</p></section><section id=\"otnotice-section-d44e6267-b33b-4935-9f62-f2bf6b0517e4\"><p>We will post any adjustments to the Policy on this page, and the revised version will be effective when it is posted.
