Also in those cases only recordings and transcripts with access rights given to the support team member will be accessed. acta may collect, store and process various kinds of data, with different legal grounds, as listed below. We will not sell collected data to other companies.</p><div class="mt-8"><h4 class="text-xl text-white font-semibold">User account information</h4><p class="text-lg text-gray-300 font-normal mt-2">Users that choose to register in acta are asked to sign up with an external authentication service, e.g. Google Sign-In or similar.
