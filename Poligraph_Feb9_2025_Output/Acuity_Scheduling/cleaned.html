  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>3. How we collect your information</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We obtain information about you from various sources. We do this in three main ways:</p><ul data-rte-list="default" style="margin-left:40px;"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account).</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We record some of it automatically when you use our Services or, where you are an End User, from your visits to Customers’ sites (including with technologies like cookies).</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We receive some of it from third parties (like when you register for an account using a third party service like Apple, Facebook or Google, when you purchase our products from an authorized reseller, when you make payments to us using our payment processor or via a mobile app store or when we receive information about potential enterprise sales leads).</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We’ve described this in more detail below.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>a. Information you provide</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you use our Services, we collect information from you in a number of ways. For instance, we ask you to provide your Customer Account Details to create and manage your account. We also maintain your Marketing Preferences and your Communication Information that you provide to us. You might also provide us with information in other ways, including by responding to surveys, participating in user research or entering a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sometimes we require you to provide us with information for contractual or legal reasons. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default" style="margin-left:40px;"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">we may ask you to provide a mailing address and/or select your jurisdiction when you sign up for our paid Services (e.g., purchase a subscription) to determine if, and how much, tax we need to collect from you; or&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">if you use the Payments Services through the Services, in accordance with the <a href="/payments-terms" title="http://www.squarespace.com/payments-terms" target="">Squarespace Payments Terms</a>, in order to provide the Payments Services and to comply with our contractual and legal obligations, we collect additional information related to the Payments Services and Processing Services, including Payments Services Account Information and possibly Payments Services Identity Verification Information.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We’ll normally let you know when information is required, and the consequences of failing to provide it. If you do not provide requested information, you may not be able to use our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with the service or if we are legally required to collect it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>b. Information obtained from your use of our Services</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you use our Services, we collect Site Usage Information and Account History Information about your activity on and interaction with the Services. If permission has been granted through your device settings, Site Usage Information for our mobile apps may include your precise location information.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you are an End User of a Customer’s site, we also get Site Usage Information about your interactions with their sites.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Some of this information is collected automatically using cookies and similar technologies when you use our Services or, if you are an End User, when you visit a Customer’s site. We let our Customers control what cookies and similar technologies are used through their sites (except those we need to use to properly provide the Services, such as for functionality, performance or security related reasons). You can read more about our use of cookies in our <a href="/cookie-policy" title="https://www.squarespace.com/cookie-policy" target="">Cookie Policy</a>. Some of this information is similarly collected automatically through your browser or from your device.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>c. Information obtained from other sources</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you use a third party service (such as Apple, Facebook or Google) to register for an account, the third party service may provide us with your Customer Account Details on your behalf, but we don’t collect or store passwords you use to access third party services. We do not control what information a third party service provides to us. The third party service you use may give you options on what the service discloses to us if you link your third party service account with the Services. Make sure you are comfortable with what these third party services share by reviewing their privacy policies and, if necessary, modifying your privacy settings directly on the third party service.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you sign up for our paid Services via a third party service acting as an authorized reseller of our products, the reseller business partner may provide us with information on your behalf which is necessary for us to complete your paid Services sign up, such as your Customer Account Details.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you use third party services which are integrated with the Services, including financial products, we may receive information about your use of such third party services via our integration business partners.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Currently, our payment processors are Stripe and PayPal. Each payment processor uses and processes your complete payment information in accordance with its applicable privacy policy (<a href="https://stripe.com/privacy/" title="https://stripe.com/privacy/">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full" title="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">PayPal</a>).&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default" style="margin-left:40px;"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you sign up for paid Services with us using a payment card, we obtain limited information about your payment card from our payment processor, such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you sign up for paid Services with us using PayPal or another non-payment card payment method, we may obtain information about your payment method from our payment processor, such as: (i) for PayPal, the email address associated with your PayPal account; and (ii) for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the last four digits of your bank account number, the country of your bank account and your bank’s bank code and branch code.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The preceding payment processors paragraph is not applicable:</p><ul data-rte-list="default" style="margin-left:40px;"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">if you sign up for paid Services as an in-app purchase via a mobile app store, in which case the mobile app store’s privacy policy will apply. Please see<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" title="https://policies.google.com/privacy"> Google's privacy policy</a> and<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" title="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/"> Apple's privacy policy</a> for information about how they use and process your payment information.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">if you sign up for paid Services via a third party service acting as an authorized reseller of our products. Please see the authorized reseller’s privacy policy for information about how they use and process your payment information.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="/privacy/#top" title="https://squarespace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LEG/pages/15656031641/Privacy+Policy#Effective-Date%3A-January-14%2C-2025" target=""><em>Back to top</em></a></p>

Learn about and analyze your interactions with our Services and third parties’ online services so we can tailor our advertising to what we think will interest you. For example, we may decide not to advertise our Services to you on a social media site if you already signed up for paid Services or we may choose to serve you a particular advertisement based on your current subscription plan or what we think may interest you based on your Account History Information. In certain US states, you have the right to opt out of our sharing of your information with such third party online services.

Provide you with a customized Services experience. For example, we may use your location information to determine your language preferences or display accurate date and time information. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to help us achieve this purpose, such as remembering which of your sites you most recently edited.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Improving our Services</strong>.

We commit to not de-aggregating or re-identifying the aggregated and/or anonymized data that we process. Our use and disclosure of de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may use and disclose it to others for any purpose, without limitation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For our Users in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”) we rely on the legal bases set out in the table below to process your information.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>8.

We also retain your information for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, protect us in the event of disputes, enforce our agreements or to protect our or others’ interests.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The precise periods for which we keep your information vary depending on the nature of the information and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your account is active, while the period for which we keep a support message is based on how long has passed since the last submission in the thread.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Customers may have a seasonal site or come back to us after an account becomes inactive, if you’re a Customer, we may not immediately delete your information when your trial expires or you cancel all your paid Services.

Data Privacy Frameworks</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Squarespace, Inc. complies with the Data Privacy Frameworks to provide a legal basis for transfers of personal data to Squarespace, Inc. in the US from, as applicable, the EEA, Switzerland and the UK. Squarespace, Inc. has certified its compliance to the Data Privacy Frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Squarespace, Inc.’s certification extends to its processing of personal information (received from the European Region under the Data Privacy Frameworks) of the type and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy also describes the types of third parties to which personal information is disclosed (and the purposes for such), individual’s right of access, the choice and means offered to limit the use and disclosure of personal information and that personal information is disclosed in response to legal requests by public authorities where necessary, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Squarespace, Inc. is committed to treating personal information received from the European Region pursuant to the applicable Data Privacy Framework in accordance with the principles thereof (the “DPF Principles”). You can find our certification <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000GnjcAAC&amp;status=Active" title="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000GnjcAAC&amp;status=Active">here</a> and you can learn more about the Data Privacy Frameworks (as determined based upon the country from which the personal information was received) and DPF Principles by visiting <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" title="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>. For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, Squarespace, Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our accountability for personal information we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the DPF Principles. In particular, we may use third parties to process data on our behalf as described in this Privacy Policy, and we remain liable if they do so in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have a question or complaint you believe to be within the scope of our Data Privacy Frameworks certification, please contact us first at <a href="mailto:privacy@squarespace.com" title="mailto:privacy@squarespace.com">privacy@squarespace.com</a>, or using the contact details in the “How to contact us” section below. Any complaint must include a description of your claim and proof of your relationship with Squarespace. We'll respond within 45 days.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any complaint that we can’t resolve directly after 45 days may be resolved by JAMS, which is the independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Data Privacy Frameworks compliance. You can contact JAMS free of charge at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution" title="https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution">https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution</a>. JAMS is an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the US.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If your concern still isn't addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under the DPF Principles through the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, which is the international division of the American Arbitration Association (“ICDR-AAA”) and which is the administrator for the Data Privacy Frameworks binding arbitration program. The administration of all such arbitrations will be in accordance with ICDR-AAA’s applicable dispute resolution rules and procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed (the “ICDR-AAA Rules”). If you are in the EEA or the UK, please see the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules <a href="https://go.adr.org/rs/294-SFS-516/images/ICDR-AAA_EU-US_DPF_AnnexI_Arbitration_Rules.pdf" title="https://go.adr.org/rs/294-SFS-516/images/ICDR-AAA_EU-US_DPF_AnnexI_Arbitration_Rules.pdf">here</a>.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, both you and Squarespace agree to the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules relating to mass arbitration filings, including without limitation the <a href="https://go.adr.org/mass-arbitration-rules-april2024.html" title="https://go.adr.org/mass-arbitration-rules-april2024.html">ICDR-AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and Fee Schedules</a>, but excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any dispute resolution demand or counterclaim, including arbitration demand or counterclaim, asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted and the factual allegations on which those claims are based, and must include proof that the claimant’s data is subject to this Privacy Policy. ICDR-AAA may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. ICDR-AAA has the right to impose sanctions for any claims it determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and any similar standards in other jurisdictions), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant whose data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Nothing in the Data Privacy Frameworks affects your rights as a data subject to the extent we use any European Commission approved standard data protection clauses for transfers to the US.
