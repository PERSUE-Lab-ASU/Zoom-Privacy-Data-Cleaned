For instance, we ask you to provide your Customer Account Details to create and manage your account. We also maintain your Marketing Preferences and your Communication Information that you provide to us. You might also provide us with information in other ways, including by responding to surveys, participating in user research or entering a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion.</p><p>Sometimes we require you to provide us with information for contractual or legal reasons.

Information obtained from other sources</strong></p><p>If you use a third party service (such as Apple, Facebook or Google) to register for an account, the third party service may provide us with your Customer Account Details on your behalf, but we don\u2019t collect or store passwords you use to access third party services. We do not control what information a third party service provides to us. The third party service you use may give you options on what the service discloses to us if you link your third party service account with the Services.

Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your account is active, while the period for which we keep a support message is based on how long has passed since the last submission in the thread.</p><p>As Customers may have a seasonal site or come back to us after an account becomes inactive, if you\u2019re a Customer, we may not immediately delete your information when your trial expires or you cancel all your paid Services. Instead, we keep your information for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.</p><p>You may delete your account by following the instructions in <a href=\"https://support.squarespace.com/hc/articles/228036268-Deleting-your-account\" target=\"_blank\">this support guide</a> and/or contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@squarespace.com\" title=\"mailto:privacy@squarespace.com\">privacy@squarespace.com</a>.</p><p>Please note that in the course of providing the Services, we may create, collect and/or maintain de-personalized information, which we may retain indefinitely.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/privacy/#top\" title=\"https://squarespace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LEG/pages/15656031641/Privacy+Policy#Effective-Date%3A-January-14%2C-2025\" target=\"\"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>\n</div><div data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1738337495467_19035\">\n  <p><strong>9.

The CCPA\u2019s definition of \"Sale\" includes \u201cSharing\u201d for purposes of \u201ccross-context behavioral advertising,\u201d which is defined as targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer\u2019s personal information obtained from the consumer\u2019s activity across websites. We only mean this CCPA definition when \u201cshare\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d are capitalized in this Appendix I or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. We Share information to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services. Depending on how you use the Services, we may Share device information and identifiers, such as IP address and unique advertising identifiers and cookies, for such purposes. We do not otherwise \u201cSell\u201d (as defined in the CCPA) your personal information, and have not engaged in such activity in the twelve (12) months prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>If you would like to opt out of Squarespace's Sale or Sharing of your information with third parties for such purposes, you may do so by clicking on the \u201cYour Privacy Choices\u201d link in the footer of this page.

We collect the following categories of \u201csensitive personal information\u201d: (i) account log-in and password or other credentials that allow access to your account; and (ii) geolocation information. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.</p><p>We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the \u201cGlobal Privacy Control,\u201d which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your personal information for online behavioral advertising purposes. We respond to the Global Privacy Control in California. To opt out of Sale or Sharing, turn on the Global Privacy Control signal in your browser.

However, Squarespace does not create, store or otherwise have access to any such biometric data. Payments Services Identity Verification Information also includes details that are listed on such official government documents.Optional 2FA Account Information: You may optionally provide us with additional information, such as your phone number, if you wish to enable two factor authentication (2FA) on your customer account.\u00a0Account History Information: Information about your account\u2019s use of the Services, including your trials, subscriptions, discount code usage and related details.

How we collect your informationWe obtain information about you from various sources. We do this in three main ways:You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account).We record some of it automatically when you use our Services or, where you are an End User, from your visits to Customers\u2019 sites (including with technologies like cookies).We receive some of it from third parties (like when you register for an account using a third party service like Apple, Facebook or Google, when you purchase our products from an authorized reseller, when you make payments to us using our payment processor or via a mobile app store or when we receive information about potential enterprise sales leads).We\u2019ve described this in more detail below.a. Information you provideWhen you use our Services, we collect information from you in a number of ways. For instance, we ask you to provide your Customer Account Details to create and manage your account. We also maintain your Marketing Preferences and your Communication Information that you provide to us. You might also provide us with information in other ways, including by responding to surveys, participating in user research or entering a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion.Sometimes we require you to provide us with information for contractual or legal reasons. For example:\u00a0we may ask you to provide a mailing address and/or select your jurisdiction when you sign up for our paid Services (e.g., purchase a subscription) to determine if, and how much, tax we need to collect from you; or\u00a0if you use the Payments Services through the Services, in accordance with the Squarespace Payments Terms, in order to provide the Payments Services and to comply with our contractual and legal obligations, we collect additional information related to the Payments Services and Processing Services, including Payments Services Account Information and possibly Payments Services Identity Verification Information.We\u2019ll normally let you know when information is required, and the consequences of failing to provide it. If you do not provide requested information, you may not be able to use our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with the service or if we are legally required to collect it.b. Information obtained from your use of our ServicesWhen you use our Services, we collect Site Usage Information and Account History Information about your activity on and interaction with the Services. If permission has been granted through your device settings, Site Usage Information for our mobile apps may include your precise location information.If you are an End User of a Customer\u2019s site, we also get Site Usage Information about your interactions with their sites.\u00a0Some of this information is collected automatically using cookies and similar technologies when you use our Services or, if you are an End User, when you visit a Customer\u2019s site. We let our Customers control what cookies and similar technologies are used through their sites (except those we need to use to properly provide the Services, such as for functionality, performance or security related reasons). You can read more about our use of cookies in our Cookie Policy. Some of this information is similarly collected automatically through your browser or from your device.c. Information obtained from other sourcesIf you use a third party service (such as Apple, Facebook or Google) to register for an account, the third party service may provide us with your Customer Account Details on your behalf, but we don\u2019t collect or store passwords you use to access third party services. We do not control what information a third party service provides to us. The third party service you use may give you options on what the service discloses to us if you link your third party service account with the Services. Make sure you are comfortable with what these third party services share by reviewing their privacy policies and, if necessary, modifying your privacy settings directly on the third party service.If you sign up for our paid Services via a third party service acting as an authorized reseller of our products, the reseller business partner may provide us with information on your behalf which is necessary for us to complete your paid Services sign up, such as your Customer Account Details.If you use third party services which are integrated with the Services, including financial products, we may receive information about your use of such third party services via our integration business partners.\u00a0Currently, our payment processors are Stripe and PayPal. Each payment processor uses and processes your complete payment information in accordance with its applicable privacy policy (Stripe and PayPal).\u00a0If you sign up for paid Services with us using a payment card, we obtain limited information about your payment card from our payment processor, such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date.\u00a0If you sign up for paid Services with us using PayPal or another non-payment card payment method, we may obtain information about your payment method from our payment processor, such as: (i) for PayPal, the email address associated with your PayPal account; and (ii) for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the last four digits of your bank account number, the country of your bank account and your bank\u2019s bank code and branch code.\u00a0The preceding payment processors paragraph is not applicable:if you sign up for paid Services as an in-app purchase via a mobile app store, in which case the mobile app store\u2019s privacy policy will apply. Please see Google's privacy policy and Apple's privacy policy for information about how they use and process your payment information.\u00a0if you sign up for paid Services via a third party service acting as an authorized reseller of our products. Please see the authorized reseller\u2019s privacy policy for information about how they use and process your payment information.Back to top\n\n  4.

Learn about and analyze how the Services are accessed and used and evaluate and improve our Services (including by developing new products and services and managing our communications). For example, if we learn that most Customers of paid Services use a particular integration or feature, we might wish to expand on that integration or feature.Security. Foster the safety, security and integrity of our Services. If you use the Payments Services, in accordance with the Squarespace Payments Terms, this also includes fraud and risk monitoring, such as verifying your identity, determining your eligibility for certain Payments Services, detecting and investigating fraud and mitigating financial loss or other harm to you, Squarespace, your End Users or others.Third party relationships.

We commit to not de-aggregating or re-identifying the aggregated and/or anonymized data that we process. Our use and disclosure of de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may use and disclose it to others for any purpose, without limitation.For our Users in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) we rely on the legal bases set out in the table below to process your information.

You can find our certification here and you can learn more about the Data Privacy Frameworks (as determined based upon the country from which the personal information was received) and DPF Principles by visiting https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/. For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, Squarespace, Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.Our accountability for personal information we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the DPF Principles. In particular, we may use third parties to process data on our behalf as described in this Privacy Policy, and we remain liable if they do so in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.If you have a question or complaint you believe to be within the scope of our Data Privacy Frameworks certification, please contact us first at privacy@squarespace.com, or using the contact details in the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d section below. Any complaint must include a description of your claim and proof of your relationship with Squarespace. We'll respond within 45 days.Any complaint that we can\u2019t resolve directly after 45 days may be resolved by JAMS, which is the independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Data Privacy Frameworks compliance. You can contact JAMS free of charge at https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution. JAMS is an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the US.If your concern still isn't addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under the DPF Principles through the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, which is the international division of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cICDR-AAA\u201d) and which is the administrator for the Data Privacy Frameworks binding arbitration program. The administration of all such arbitrations will be in accordance with ICDR-AAA\u2019s applicable dispute resolution rules and procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed (the \u201cICDR-AAA Rules\u201d). If you are in the EEA or the UK, please see the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules here. If you are in Switzerland, please see the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules here. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, both you and Squarespace agree to the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules relating to mass arbitration filings, including without limitation the ICDR-AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and Fee Schedules, but excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions.\u00a0Any dispute resolution demand or counterclaim, including arbitration demand or counterclaim, asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party\u2019s identity, the claims being asserted and the factual allegations on which those claims are based, and must include proof that the claimant\u2019s data is subject to this Privacy Policy. ICDR-AAA may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. ICDR-AAA has the right to impose sanctions for any claims it determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and any similar standards in other jurisdictions), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant whose data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.Nothing in the Data Privacy Frameworks affects your rights as a data subject to the extent we use any European Commission approved standard data protection clauses for transfers to the US. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and applicable DPF Principles, the applicable DPF Principles shall govern.Back to top\u00a0\n\n  12.

Your requestsSubject to certain exceptions and restrictions, the CCPA provides California Residents the right to submit requests to a business which has collected their personal information: (i) to provide them with access to the specific pieces and categories of personal information collected by the business about such California Resident, the categories of sources for such information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting such information, and the categories of unaffiliated parties to whom such information was disclosed; (ii) to request correction of their inaccurate personal information; and (iii) to delete their personal information (each, a \u201cCalifornia Request\u201d). We need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete some or all of your information, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.If you are a California Resident, please follow the instructions in the \u201cYour rights and choices\u201d section above to submit California Requests and please make sure you note that you are a California Resident when you do so. California Residents may designate an authorized agent to make California Requests on their behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a California Request on your behalf, you or your agent must provide proof that the agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf, such as written authorization signed by you authorizing that agent to act on your behalf. We reserve the right to request additional information from you and/or individuals purporting to be authorized agents, such as when we suspect fraud.c. Do not sell or share my personal informationCalifornia residents may opt out of the \"Sale\" or \u201cSharing\u201d of their personal information. The CCPA\u2019s definition of \"Sale\" includes \u201cSharing\u201d for purposes of \u201ccross-context behavioral advertising,\u201d which is defined as targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer\u2019s personal information obtained from the consumer\u2019s activity across websites. We only mean this CCPA definition when \u201cshare\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d are capitalized in this Appendix I or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. We Share information to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services. Depending on how you use the Services, we may Share device information and identifiers, such as IP address and unique advertising identifiers and cookies, for such purposes.

We collect the following categories of \u201csensitive personal information\u201d: (i) account log-in and password or other credentials that allow access to your account; and (ii) geolocation information. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the \u201cGlobal Privacy Control,\u201d which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your personal information for online behavioral advertising purposes. We respond to the Global Privacy Control in California. To opt out of Sale or Sharing, turn on the Global Privacy Control signal in your browser. Please note that the opt out will only apply to the browser and device you use to send the Global Privacy Control signal.We do not knowingly Sell or Share the personal information of children under 16.d.
