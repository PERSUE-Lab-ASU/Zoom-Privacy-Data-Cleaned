This information in some cases may only be stored temporarily, or transiently, e.g. during a particular secure session between your computer and a Genesis Digital server.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We may also ask for certain information only in circumstances where required by law. For example, if you are using the KARTRA shopping cart, where we are required when setting up certain financial accounts to obtain e.g. your Social Security number (SSN), then we will ask for it. As above, such information may only be stored transiently, during a secure session.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h5 id=\"h-how-we-use-your-personal-information\">How we use your personal information</h5>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Optional Communications: The personal information we collect allows us to provide you with Genesis Digital\u2019s latest product announcements, helpful tips and information, special offers, software updates, and upcoming events.

Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To help Genesis Digital serve you better, we use technological means to better understand and adapt to user behavior. To accomplish this, the Sites, as well as our online software and services, email messages, and advertisements may use cookies or related technology such as pixel tags, clear gifs, and web beacons. These technologies help us to know which parts of the Sites people have visited and provide data to aid us in understanding the effectiveness of the software services, our advertisements, and web searches. These data are used to improve our software, products, services, communications, and advertisements. We generally consider such information collected through the use of cookies and other technologies as non-personal information and treat it accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use the Sites, software, products, or services. These uses are intended to improve your personal experience. For example, we can provide better and more personal results if we \u2018remember\u2019 your preferred settings, your name, and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Genesis Digital may use cookies or other technologies in connection with certain advertising services to determine your experience with our content including whether an ad is likely to be of interest to you, whether or not you are served a particular ad, and the number of times you are served a particular ad. These technologies allow us to measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns. You may have options for opting out of such targeted ads. You should contact your service provider or your mobile provider to inquire about how to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Genesis Digital also uses specific technologies in connection with certain communications such as emails that may be used to track actions by recipients. For example, these communications may include one or more clickable text or graphics that include URLs that link to content on the Sites. However, these URLs may pass through a web server that tracks the click before arriving at the linked content on the Sites. The tracked data can help Genesis Digital determine the effectiveness of our communications to users and customers, or to gauge interest in specific topics. If you prefer not to have your responses to such communications tracked in this manner, do not click links in the email messages. Such communications may also include pixel tags that can tell us whether e.g. an email has been opened. We may use this information to throttle the number of messages sent to users or customers, or to remove people who do not read or interact with our communications from one or more lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also use cookies and other technologies to track certain behaviors of unknown visitors on our site. E.g. if you visit our site by following a link in an email from a third party or in an advertisement from such a party, we may track that behavior. In such cases, we may not have any personally identifying information about you at that time; however, if you later sign up for a product or service, or make a purchase, we may be able to associate your past behaviors on our sites with you thereafter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cookies and other technologies can generally be controlled on your devices. If you want to disable cookies you should review your privacy or security settings. Please note that certain features of the Sites or related software, products, or services may not be available if you have cookies disabled on your device. We will typically try to warn you that a page or feature you are trying to reach will not function without cookies enabled. If you have your cookies on your device or browser disabled and are having difficulties, you may wish to enable them to see if the problem is resolved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s worth mentioning that some of these cookies are strictly necessary to&nbsp;the operational functioning of the platform, such as for example those related to the transactional checkout process. Some others, while improving the user experience and feature scope of the platform, are not strictly necessary to utilize our services such as, for example, certain&nbsp;tracking cookies.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h5 id=\"h-cookies-we-use-on-our-platform\">Cookies we use on our Platform</h5>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Session Cookies. </strong>These cookies are strictly necessary for the use of the Kartra platform.

To help maintain your privacy and the security of your personal information, we communicate this and all of our privacy policies to Genesis Digital employees and agents, and we internally enforce privacy safeguards. Most recently we have implemented our GDPR compliance efforts with respect to our customers in the EU and were fully compliant not later than May 25th 2018, the GDPR implementation date.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store information received from you in connection with the Sites. Before disclosing information to us, please familiarize yourself with our privacy practices so you can understand how your information may be used by Genesis Digital. If you are a Controller of personal data under the GDPR and want to understand how Genesis Digital processes data please request a copy of our Data Processing Addendum to our End-User License Agreement.\n\n\n\nOur Collection and Use of Information:\n\n\n\nGenesis Digital may collect information in a number of ways from users who access our Sites or services. We collect personal and non-personal information in various ways. You may provide your information to us to receive a product, service, or communication from us; we may request your information to better serve you; or we may require your information in order to be able complete a transaction (e.g. a purchase) or provide access (e.g. to a paid service).\n\n\n\nA. Collection of Personal Information\n\n\n\nPersonal information (or \u201cPersonally Identifiable Information\u201d or \u201cPII\u201d) is information and data that can be used to specifically identify or contact a single person. You may be asked to provide your personal information when you contact Genesis Digital for any reason. Genesis Digital may share your personal information internally. If we do, we will use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also combine personal information with other information to help us to develop or improve our products, services, content, communications, and/or advertising, or to provide improved user experiences for you.\n\n\n\nPersonal information we collect\n\n\n\nExamples of some types of personal information Genesis Digital may collect in connection with the Sites and how we may use it include the following:\n\n\n\n\nWhen you purchase, register, or login to use software, products, or services, request support, download a software update, register for a webinar, live workshop, or training, provide feedback on a software product, or participate in a promotion, contest or online survey, or respond to an advertisement, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and/or social media credentials. Genesis Digital does not directly collect credit card numbers in connection with the EverWebinar, WebinarJam, or on the websites provided in connection therewith. Payments for those products/services are made through other means or sites and thus we do not collect or store credit card numbers in connection with any of those products/services that this Policy applies to. We may collect credit card information in connection with your use of KARTRA shopping cart services.\n\n\n\nIf you use the EverWebinar or WebinarJam family of software/services, or the KARTRA shopping cart, we may collect information required to provide the services in connection with such service including PII such as your name, email address, IP address and current location. We may also collect certain personally identifying financial information (\u201cPIFI\u201d) in connection with the KARTRA shopping cart. Such PIFI may include your credit card number (or a portion thereof), the expiration date for the credit card, bank information such as your bank\u2019s name, routing number, and/or your account information. This information in some cases may only be stored temporarily, or transiently, e.g. during a particular secure session between your computer and a Genesis Digital server.\n\n\n\nWe may also ask for certain information only in circumstances where required by law. For example, if you are using the KARTRA shopping cart, where we are required when setting up certain financial accounts to obtain e.g. your Social Security number (SSN), then we will ask for it. As above, such information may only be stored transiently, during a secure session.\n\n\n\n\nHow we use your personal information\n\n\n\n\nOptional Communications: The personal information we collect allows us to provide you with Genesis Digital\u2019s latest product announcements, helpful tips and information, special offers, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don\u2019t want to receive these communications, or do not wish to be on our mailing list, you can opt out of receiving them. Each communication will provide opt-out directions, and you can also generally opt-out via your account dashboard if you are a registered user, client, or customer. The information in connection with these optional communications and your responses help us to improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\n\n\n\nWe also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, improve, and customize our software, products, services, content, and advertising and to provide a better user experience for every user of our software, products, and services.\n\n\n\nImportant Communications: We may use your personal information to send important communications, e.g., about your purchases of or access to software, products, or services, material changes to our EULA, terms, conditions, and policies (including this Privacy Policy), critical updates to software products, or services, or changes (including regulatory changes) that impact your use of Genesis Digital software, products, or services. Because this information is vital to your interaction with Genesis Digital, you may NOT opt out of receiving these communications if you wish to continue to use the Sites, or any software, products, or services offered in connection with the Sites.\n\n\n\nWe may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Genesis Digital\u2019s software, products, services, communications, support and/or help functions, and user interfaces.\n\n\n\nIf you enter into a promotion such as a contest, a giveaway, a one-time or special offer, or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.\n\n\n\nIf we become involved in a legal process as a result of your actions on the Sites, or in connection with any software, products, or services offered via the Sites, we may be required to disclose your PII or PIFI to a government authority, or a third party who e.g., issues a subpoena that require us to provide it. Our response(s) to any such legal process will be handled on a case-by-case basis following the advice of our attorneys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONSENT: Genesis Digital will continue to respect and value privacy in the age of GDPR regulations. To the extent commercially practicable, and in accordance with legal or regulatory requirements we obtain your clear, informed consent before collecting your personal data. We will also always work to balance obtaining clear consent with providing useful and powerful platforms and convenient and graceful user interfaces.\n\n\n\nB. Collection of Non-Personal Information\n\n\n\nInformation of a type or in a form that does not permit direct identification of or association with any specific individual is \u2018non-personal information.\u2019 Combinations of personal and non-personal information are considered personal information if the combined information can be used to identify or contact any specific individual(s). Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy as long as it cannot be used to identify or contact any specific individual. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and certain other identifiers may be considered personal information under various local laws; we endeavor to comply with the laws and regulations that are applicable to us.\n\n\n\nHow we collect and use your non-personal information\n\n\n\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\u00a0The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:\n\n\n\n\nWe may collect non-personal information (e.g. demographic information) regarding our customers collectively including information such as age, gender, occupation, preferred language, zip code, area code, geographic location, or the time zone from which customers access the Sites, products, or services. Such non-personal information is used so that we can better understand who our customers are, and their behavior generally with regards the Sites, and to improve our software, products, services, communications, support, help, user experiences, and advertising for our customers.\n\n\n\nWe also may collect non-personal information regarding customer activities on the Sites or use of the Genesis Digital software, products, and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of the Sites, or our software, products, and services are of most interest or which can be improved. Non-personal support or help request data may be used to improve our software or the Sites, communications, and user interfaces, or to allow us to provide additional product or service offerings to our present or future customers.\n\n\n\nWe may collect non-personal information regarding the digital footprints of our customers with respect to accessing the Sites, or any related software, products, or services including mobile and non-mobile access, specific types of devices being used, unique device IDs, type of browser(s) being used, networks that our customers use, and other non-personal information. This information may be used to improve the Sites, software, products, or services including but not limited to their performance, functionality, design, or responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\nC. Cookies and Other Technologies\n\n\n\nTo help Genesis Digital serve you better, we use technological means to better understand and adapt to user behavior. To accomplish this, the Sites, as well as our online software and services, email messages, and advertisements may use cookies or related technology such as pixel tags, clear gifs, and web beacons. These technologies help us to know which parts of the Sites people have visited and provide data to aid us in understanding the effectiveness of the software services, our advertisements, and web searches. These data are used to improve our software, products, services, communications, and advertisements. We generally consider such information collected through the use of cookies and other technologies as non-personal information and treat it accordingly.\n\n\n\nWe also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use the Sites, software, products, or services. These uses are intended to improve your personal experience. For example, we can provide better and more personal results if we \u2018remember\u2019 your preferred settings, your name, and such.\n\n\n\nGenesis Digital may use cookies or other technologies in connection with certain advertising services to determine your experience with our content including whether an ad is likely to be of interest to you, whether or not you are served a particular ad, and the number of times you are served a particular ad. These technologies allow us to measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns. You may have options for opting out of such targeted ads. You should contact your service provider or your mobile provider to inquire about how to do so.\n\n\n\nGenesis Digital also uses specific technologies in connection with certain communications such as emails that may be used to track actions by recipients. For example, these communications may include one or more clickable text or graphics that include URLs that link to content on the Sites. However, these URLs may pass through a web server that tracks the click before arriving at the linked content on the Sites. The tracked data can help Genesis Digital determine the effectiveness of our communications to users and customers, or to gauge interest in specific topics. If you prefer not to have your responses to such communications tracked in this manner, do not click links in the email messages. Such communications may also include pixel tags that can tell us whether e.g. an email has been opened. We may use this information to throttle the number of messages sent to users or customers, or to remove people who do not read or interact with our communications from one or more lists.\n\n\n\nWe also use cookies and other technologies to track certain behaviors of unknown visitors on our site. E.g. if you visit our site by following a link in an email from a third party or in an advertisement from such a party, we may track that behavior. In such cases, we may not have any personally identifying information about you at that time; however, if you later sign up for a product or service, or make a purchase, we may be able to associate your past behaviors on our sites with you thereafter.\n\n\n\nCookies and other technologies can generally be controlled on your devices. If you want to disable cookies you should review your privacy or security settings. Please note that certain features of the Sites or related software, products, or services may not be available if you have cookies disabled on your device. We will typically try to warn you that a page or feature you are trying to reach will not function without cookies enabled. If you have your cookies on your device or browser disabled and are having difficulties, you may wish to enable them to see if the problem is resolved.\n\n\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth mentioning that some of these cookies are strictly necessary to\u00a0the operational functioning of the platform, such as for example those related to the transactional checkout process. Some others, while improving the user experience and feature scope of the platform, are not strictly necessary to utilize our services such as, for example, certain\u00a0tracking cookies.\n\n\n\nCookies we use on our Platform\n\n\n\n\nSession Cookies.
