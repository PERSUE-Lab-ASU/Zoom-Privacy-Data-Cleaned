<h2>Information we collect</h2>

<p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Account and profile information.</strong> When you sign up for a WakaTime account,
we store information such as your email address. This will never be shared
publicly without your consent. We retain your data while you have an active
account. You may delete your WakaTime account at any time using
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://wakatime.com/settings/delete_account">this form</a>. When you delete your own WakaTime account,
your account and profile information and all integration data including
Slack, Google, GitHub, Zoom, and Microsoft integration information is deleted
according to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wakatime.com/legal/data-security">WakaTime Data Security Policy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Billing information.</strong> We collect billing address and credit card
information if you purchase a premium version of WakaTime. Billing address
and credit card information is securely passed to our payment processing
partner and is not stored at WakaTime.</li>
<li><strong>Plugin usage content.</strong> We collect and store the path of the file you are
editing, timestamps, project names, branch names, editor names &amp;
versions, languages, libraries/imports from opened files, line counts of
opened files, position of your cursor in opened files, your computer’s
hostname, your computer’s timezone, your computer's operating system name and
version information, and websites visited in your browser from your usage of
our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wakatime.com/editors">downloadable plugins</a>. We do not receive or store your source
code. All plugin usage information will never be shared publicly without your
consent. This information is deleted when you delete your WakaTime account.</li>
<li><strong>Integrations.</strong> If you grant us authorization to
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://wakatime.com/integrations">integrate with another service provider</a>, we will connect that
service to ours and only collect data from that service which is necessary
to provide you the integration service. For example when you connect the
Google Calendar integration, we temporarily store the names of your calendars
during the integration setup process. After you have selected which calendars
to integrate with WakaTime, we only store the calendar names, event titles,
event start times, and event end times for the calendars you have selected.
We do not receive or store calendar data for calendars which you have not
selected. When you connect the Slack integration, we temporarily store a list
of your available channel names. After you have selected a Slack channel for
the integration, we only store the selected Slack channel’s ID. We do not
receive or store any Slack messages or any other information from Slack. We
do not receive or store your passwords or source code for any
integration services. You can remove an integration at any time which unbinds
that integration on a go-forward basis and immediately deletes all content
that was received from that service. Your integration content is also
immediately deleted and no longer stored or indexed by WakaTime when you
delete your WakaTime account according to the
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://wakatime.com/legal/data-security">WakaTime Data Security Policy</a>. To delete your
WakaTime account, use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wakatime.com/settings/delete_account">this form</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Usage information.</strong> We may collect information about the services you use
and how you use them, like which pages you visit and which features you use.
We use cookies with unique identifiers to authenticate your login session.
Third parties, including but not limited to Google Analytics, may also use
cookies to track your return visits to the website.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we use information we collect</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and protect services
for our users. We may also use this information to improve your
user-experience with our services.
We will ask for your consent before using any of your information for a
purpose other than set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>When you contact WakaTime, we may keep a record of your name and email address
to better solve any customer issues.
We may use your name and email address to inform you about our services, such
as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>

<h2>Information we share</h2>

<p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information
about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate
safeguards on your privacy:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your
consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with
third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the integrations
that you connect to your account through our Integrations feature.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated and de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that
has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information
could not reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may publish
aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.</li>
<li><strong>As required by law:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to
a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information security</h2>

<p>We work hard to protect your private information. We enforce SSL when our users
communicate with WakaTime. We use a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">one-way hash algorithm</a> with
random salt to store your password.</p>

<p>We use a third party, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, to store your credit card information
and process payments. Your credit card information is never stored or
transmitted using our servers. We only store the last 4 digits, expiration
date, and card type of your credit card on our servers for reference. Your
credit card information is governed by
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to
this Policy from time to time. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically
to check for updates. If the changes are significant, we may notify you or
provide an additional opportunity to "opt-in", as appropriate.</p>
