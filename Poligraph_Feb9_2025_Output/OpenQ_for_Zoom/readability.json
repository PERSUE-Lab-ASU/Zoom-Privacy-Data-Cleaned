Instead when an End User expresses\n          interest in contacting a business professional for a supported Use\n          Case, OpenQ uses its proprietary algorithms to identify a suitable\n          contact information for the business professional (\u201c<strong>Contactable Business Professional</strong>\u201d) and reaches out to them directly. If the requested business\n          professional is willing to take part in the Session, she / he is\n          provided with a self-serve web-based tool to schedule the Session with\n          the End User. We believe that this protects the privacy of both our\n          End Users as well as the Contactable Business Professionals since the\n          contact information of neither party is shared with the other until\n          both parties have mutually agreed to meet and a Session has been\n          scheduled.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We strongly respect the privacy preferences expressed by Contactable\n          Business Professionals.

About OpenQ \n        \n          OpenQ, Inc. is an incorporated company established in Delaware. OpenQ\n          processes personal data as a processor on behalf of our Licensees. All\n          processing activities performed on this basis are framed in a lawful\n          and secure way. If you pay by using a credit card, our service\n          provider\u00a0Stripe Inc.\u00a0processes your payment information, and OpenQ does not have direct\n          access to it.\n        \n        \n          OpenQ operates a Software-as-a-Service platform for End Users (who are\n          typically business professionals working in Product and Research teams\n          or business owners) to improve their user research processes,\n          including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 allowing End Users to recruit and\n          schedule user research sessions or interviews\n          (\u201dInterview\u201d or \u201cSession\u201d) with\n          business professionals in other companies for the purposes (\u201dUse Cases\u201d) of user research and other similarly aligned activities. Examples\n          of such Use Cases include, but are not limited to, user interviews,\n          user research sessions, customer discovery interviews, customer\n          development interviews, new product / service / concept testing,\n          generative or ideation interviews, usability testing, market research\n          interviews, focus-group sessions.\n        \n        \n          OpenQ may collect, use or otherwise process personal data relating to\n          you if you are:\n        \n        \n          \n            a contact whose information is used for our B2B Database of business\n            contact details as defined below (\u201cContact\u201d);\n          \n          \n            an authorized user of a OpenQ Licensee pursuant to our Terms of\n            Service (\u201cEndUser\u201d);\n          \n          \n            a visitor of our website and online services\n            (\u201cVisitor\u201d).\n          \n        \n        \n          This Privacy Policy outlines our practices with respect to processing\n          personal data (\u201cData\u201d). Please read it carefully so\n          that you understand how we may, as applicable, collect, use, and\n          process your Data.\n        \n     3. What information we collect \n    \n          We collect and process Data relating to OpenQ Contacts, End Users, and\n          Visitors.\n        \n        \n          3.1. Information in OpenQ B2B Database\u00a0(\u201cContact Data\u201d)\n        \n        \n          OpenQ does not directly sell contact data about businesses or business\n          professionals to its Licensees. Instead when an End User expresses\n          interest in contacting a business professional for a supported Use\n          Case, OpenQ uses its proprietary algorithms to identify a suitable\n          contact information for the business professional (\u201cContactable Business Professional\u201d) and reaches out to them directly. If the requested business\n          professional is willing to take part in the Session, she / he is\n          provided with a self-serve web-based tool to schedule the Session with\n          the End User. We believe that this protects the privacy of both our\n          End Users as well as the Contactable Business Professionals since the\n          contact information of neither party is shared with the other until\n          both parties have mutually agreed to meet and a Session has been\n          scheduled.\n        \n        \n          We strongly respect the privacy preferences expressed by Contactable\n          Business Professionals. Email communication sent to Contactable\n          Business Professionals include an option to \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d from our\n          mailing list. Contactable Business Professionals who unsubscribe from\n          our mailing list are not contacted in future, even if another End User\n          expresses an interest to contact them in future.\n        \n        \n          Although we do not directly sell contact information about businesses\n          and business professionals, in order to improve the value we deliver\n          to our End Users, we do collect and make available specific\n          non-contact information about businesses and business\n          professionals to Licensees and End Users. The information we provide\n          is limited to what you would find on a business card or a business\n          social network profile.\n        \n        \n          Our B2B Database relies on Data retrieved or derived from information\n          from the following sources:\n        \n        \n          \n            Google and Microsoft:\u00a0Where OpenQ End Users provide\n            us access to their account, for the\u00a0purposes of creating and\n            modifying calendar invites , we obtain data using Google\u2019s or\n            Microsoft\u2019s APIs.\n          \n          \n            Zoom: When OpenQ End Users provide us access to\n            their Zoom account, for the purposes of creating and modifying Zoom\n            meetings, we obtain data using Zoom APIs.\n          \n          \n            Our affiliates:\u00a0We may receive contact details\n            from\u00a0affiliates, i.e. subsidiaries, parent companies, joint\n            ventures, and other corporate entities under common ownership.\n          \n          \n            Third parties:\u00a0We may rely on business partners to\n            collect Company and Contact Information.

In\n          this event, OpenQ may use such Contact Data to identify potential\n          contacts to supplement the Service and retrieve such data from other\n          sources, verifying the accuracy of Business Contacts, removing\n          out-of-date Business Contacts from the Services, or otherwise\n          improving OpenQ\u2019s platform and the content provided by its Services.\n        \n        \n          Data collected by Payment partners\n        \n        \n          OpenQ does not collect or process your payment information directly;\n          payment processing is done by trusted third-party service providers.\n        \n        \n          3.3.
