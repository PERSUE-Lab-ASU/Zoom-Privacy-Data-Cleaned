For example, ChipBrain hires companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and\n                delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail), analyze the data we collect, market our products and\n                services,\n                handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with\n                these\n                tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, and some may use it for other purposes.\n                ChipBrain\n                does not require all agents to whom Personal Data is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements\n                and\n                to\n                agree to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n            <p>Future Business Transfers: Our business is constantly changing.

It is also\n                possible\n                that ChipBrain, or substantially all of its assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by\n                merger,\n                sale\n                of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction.</p>\n            <p>Compliance with Law and Other Disclosures: ChipBrain reserves the right to release Personal Data in order\n                to\n                comply with applicable law and regulation and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply\n                with a\n                judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us. We may also release Personal Data to\n                enforce or\n                apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services, protect us or others against\n                fraudulent\n                or inappropriate activities, or otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of ChipBrain, our\n                affiliated\n                companies, our customers, or others.</p>\n            <p>ChipBrain may use, publicly display, and publicize your name and likeness for advertising, promotion, and\n                other\n                commercial business purposes, without any additional consideration or compensation.

Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive or\n                device,\n                which enable a web site to \"personalize\" itself for each user by remembering information about the\n                user\u2019s\n                visit\n                to the web site.</p>\n            <p>ChipBrain Cookies (First Party Cookies): We at ChipBrain, use our cookies to reduce the time it takes for\n                you\n                to\n                submit purchase requests. For example, we use a cookie to store a registered user\u2019s e-mail address so\n                that\n                the\n                user does not need to enter their e-mail address each time that they log-in onto the Site. We will also\n                use\n                a\n                cookie to keep track of your search criteria while you are engaging ChipBrain\u2019s services.

These companies may use information obtained through their\n                cookies\n                (which may include your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our and\n                other\n                web sites, in combination with Personal Data or Non Personal data about your purchases and interests\n                from\n                other\n                online sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Other\n                companies'\n                use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not ours. Such advertisers may have\n                access\n                to\n                our cookies.</p>\n            <p>In addition, we may share web site usage information about visitors to our Site with these companies for\n                the\n                purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our Site and other\n                sites.\n                For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising partners may place pixel tags (also called \u201cclear\n                gifs\u201d)\n                on some of the pages you visit on our Site. We will then use the Personal Data and Non-Personal Data\n                that is\n                collected using these pixel tags to serve you relevant advertisements when you are visiting other sites\n                on\n                the\n                Internet.

Without cookies, however, you may not have access to\n                certain\n                features on our Site, including access to your profile/account and certain personalized content.</p>\n            <p>You may also delete all cookies that are already on your computer\u2019s hard drive by searching for files\n                with\n                \"cookie\" in it. This action could affect your subsequent visits to certain web sites, including our\n                Site, by\n                requiring that, for example, you enter you login name when you return to that web site.</p>\n            <h4>How You Can Access or Change Your Personal Data</h4>\n            <p>ChipBrain understands that you may want to change, access or delete your Personal Data.

ChipBrain may share your Personal Data with its affiliates and with third parties as\n                described\n                in\n                the categories below:\n            Certain Services: In order to provide you with certain services, we may share your Personal Data with our\n                affiliates or third-party partners. Third-party partners consist of companies with which ChipBrain has\n                contracted in order to provide you with services or products featured on our Site.\n            Agents of ChipBrain: Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with\n                these\n                tasks. For example, ChipBrain hires companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and\n                delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail), analyze the data we collect, market our products and\n                services,\n                handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with\n                these\n                tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, and some may use it for other purposes.\n                ChipBrain\n                does not require all agents to whom Personal Data is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements\n                and\n                to\n                agree to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.\n            Future Business Transfers: Our business is constantly changing.

It is also\n                possible\n                that ChipBrain, or substantially all of its assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by\n                merger,\n                sale\n                of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction.\n            Compliance with Law and Other Disclosures: ChipBrain reserves the right to release Personal Data in order\n                to\n                comply with applicable law and regulation and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply\n                with a\n                judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.

Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive or\n                device,\n                which enable a web site to \"personalize\" itself for each user by remembering information about the\n                user\u2019s\n                visit\n                to the web site.\n            ChipBrain Cookies (First Party Cookies): We at ChipBrain, use our cookies to reduce the time it takes for\n                you\n                to\n                submit purchase requests. For example, we use a cookie to store a registered user\u2019s e-mail address so\n                that\n                the\n                user does not need to enter their e-mail address each time that they log-in onto the Site. We will also\n                use\n                a\n                cookie to keep track of your search criteria while you are engaging ChipBrain\u2019s services.

Such advertisers may have\n                access\n                to\n                our cookies.\n            In addition, we may share web site usage information about visitors to our Site with these companies for\n                the\n                purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our Site and other\n                sites.\n                For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising partners may place pixel tags (also called \u201cclear\n                gifs\u201d)\n                on some of the pages you visit on our Site. We will then use the Personal Data and Non-Personal Data\n                that is\n                collected using these pixel tags to serve you relevant advertisements when you are visiting other sites\n                on\n                the\n                Internet.
