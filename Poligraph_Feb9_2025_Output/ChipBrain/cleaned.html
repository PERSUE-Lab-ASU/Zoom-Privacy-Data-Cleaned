            <h3 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The following describes the privacy policy of ChipBrain, Inc. (“ChipBrain”) (as amended or otherwise
                modified
                and
                in effect from time to time, the "Privacy Policy") applicable to the services available through the
                ChipBrain
                web site, our mobile applications and other interfaces (collectively, the "Site") from ChipBrain. By
                visiting
                the Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and processing of your personal data as
                described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">On occasion ChipBrain may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, regulation or
                judicial
                decisions, our Personal Data collection and use practices, the features of our Site, or advances in
                technology.
                If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your Personal Data, those changes may be
                posted
                in
                this Privacy Policy and the effective date may be noted at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.
                ChipBrain
                may
                also prominently post such material changes prior to implementing the change.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Information We May Collect</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">We may collect personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") about you that you provide to us
                while
                using
                the Site. Personal Data includes any and all information that can identify you as a specific individual,
                including, without limitation, your name, address, phone number, credit card number, bank account
                information,
                or e-mail address. We also may collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-Personal Data”),
                including,
                without limitation, your log-in name, IP address, search preferences related to specific searches, and
                messages
                you leave through your interactions with our Site. Your Non-Personal Data may be linked to your Personal
                Data
                under some circumstances and could be considered Personal Data to the extent such linkage enables you to
                be
                personally identified. ChipBrain may track users across third-party web sites or other online services,
                and
                therefore may not allow "do not track" signals or similar mechanisms.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Protecting Your Personal Data</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of Personal Data, we may
                employ
                reasonable and current Internet security methods and technologies. To protect credit card transactions
                while
                in
                transit, ChipBrain currently uses Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt Personal Data. No method of
                transmitting information over the Internet, or storing data electronically, is 100% secure, however, and
                ChipBrain therefore cannot provide a guaranty of security.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">If you purchase certain services for others, we will collect the names of the others as provided by you.
                You
                are
                fully responsible for ensuring that you have the right to provide such information, and ChipBrain will
                not
                be
                under any obligations to make any inquiries or otherwise take action to confirm your right to do so. By
                providing any Personal Data of another customer, you represent that you have all necessary authority
                and/or
                have
                obtained all necessary consents from such person to enable us to collect, use and disclose such Personal
                Data as
                set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">How We Use the Information We Collect</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">We use Personal Data to provide you with the products and services from our Site, to build features that
                will
                make the services available on the Site easier to use, and to contact you about these services and for
                any
                other
                reason we deem appropriate at our sole discretion. This may include faster purchase requests, better
                customer
                support and timely notice of new services and special offers and more relevant content.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">From time to time, ChipBrain may contact you to request feedback on your experience using the Site, to
                assist
                us
                in improving the Site, or to offer special savings or promotions to you, as a Site user or for any other
                purpose. If you would prefer not to receive notices of special savings or promotions, you may inform us
                of
                that
                preference by opt-out. This however does not restrict or prohibit us or any of our partners from
                communicating
                with you in any way and we reserve the right to communicate anything anytime at our sole discretion.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Sharing Your Personal Data</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">ChipBrain does share your Personal Data, including in ways which may not be disclosed in this policy, and
                you
                do
                hereby consent to all disclosures ChipBrain might make at its sole discretion. You waive your right to
                opt-out
                of any and all sharing of your Personal Data. We realize we’re asking for your trust. If you have any
                concerns
                about our privacy policy and agreements, please reach out to <a href="mailto:help@chipbrain.com">help@chipbrain.com</a>. We would love to hear
                your
                perspective. ChipBrain may share your Personal Data with its affiliates and with third parties as
                described
                in
                the categories below:</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Certain Services: In order to provide you with certain services, we may share your Personal Data with our
                affiliates or third-party partners. Third-party partners consist of companies with which ChipBrain has
                contracted in order to provide you with services or products featured on our Site.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Agents of ChipBrain: Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with
                these
                tasks. For example, ChipBrain hires companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and
                delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail), analyze the data we collect, market our products and
                services,
                handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with
                these
                tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, and some may use it for other purposes.
                ChipBrain
                does not require all agents to whom Personal Data is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements
                and
                to
                agree to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Future Business Transfers: Our business is constantly changing. As part of that process, ChipBrain may
                sell
                or
                buy other companies, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of these transactions. It is also
                possible
                that ChipBrain, or substantially all of its assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by
                merger,
                sale
                of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Compliance with Law and Other Disclosures: ChipBrain reserves the right to release Personal Data in order
                to
                comply with applicable law and regulation and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply
                with a
                judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us. We may also release Personal Data to
                enforce or
                apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services, protect us or others against
                fraudulent
                or inappropriate activities, or otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of ChipBrain, our
                affiliated
                companies, our customers, or others.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">ChipBrain may use, publicly display, and publicize your name and likeness for advertising, promotion, and
                other
                commercial business purposes, without any additional consideration or compensation. ChipBrain may also
                describe
                your role in relation to our business.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Cookies (&amp; Persistent Local Data)</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">To serve you faster and with better quality, we may use "cookie" technology and also allow third parties
                to
                use
                cookies on our Site. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user’s computer hard drive or
                device,
                which enable a web site to "personalize" itself for each user by remembering information about the
                user’s
                visit
                to the web site.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">ChipBrain Cookies (First Party Cookies): We at ChipBrain, use our cookies to reduce the time it takes for
                you
                to
                submit purchase requests. For example, we use a cookie to store a registered user’s e-mail address so
                that
                the
                user does not need to enter their e-mail address each time that they log-in onto the Site. We will also
                use
                a
                cookie to keep track of your search criteria while you are engaging ChipBrain’s services. ChipBrain
                cookies
                are
                associated with a user’s Personal Data.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">ChipBrain may at its sole discretion allow third parties to have access to the information we collect
                through
                our
                cookies.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Third Party Cookies and Pixels: We may also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads while you
                are
                visiting our Site and permit these companies to place and access their own cookies on your computer in
                the
                course of serving advertisements on our Site. These companies may use information obtained through their
                cookies
                (which may include your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our and
                other
                web sites, in combination with Personal Data or Non Personal data about your purchases and interests
                from
                other
                online sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Other
                companies'
                use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not ours. Such advertisers may have
                access
                to
                our cookies.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">In addition, we may share web site usage information about visitors to our Site with these companies for
                the
                purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our Site and other
                sites.
                For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising partners may place pixel tags (also called “clear
                gifs”)
                on some of the pages you visit on our Site. We will then use the Personal Data and Non-Personal Data
                that is
                collected using these pixel tags to serve you relevant advertisements when you are visiting other sites
                on
                the
                Internet. These advertisements may be targeted to specific searches you conducted on the Site during
                earlier
                browsing sessions.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">If you would like more information about the information collection practices of third-party advertising
                companies and your choices about not having this information used by these companies or opt out of
                online
                preference marketing, visit Networkadvertising.org. Without cookies, however, you may not have access to
                certain
                features on our Site, including access to your profile/account and certain personalized content.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">You may also delete all cookies that are already on your computer’s hard drive by searching for files
                with
                "cookie" in it. This action could affect your subsequent visits to certain web sites, including our
                Site, by
                requiring that, for example, you enter you login name when you return to that web site.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">How You Can Access or Change Your Personal Data</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">ChipBrain understands that you may want to change, access or delete your Personal Data. You may not do so
                by
