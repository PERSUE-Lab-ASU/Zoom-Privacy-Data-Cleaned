  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last updated: Feb 15, 2021</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how TeleVisit, Inc. handles your personal information we collect when you use our services over the Internet and mobile applications, including the TeleVisit website located at www.televisit.care (the “Site”) (collectively, the “Services”). This Policy also applies to any personal data we collect from the operation and use of TeleVisit products (the “Products), while connected to the Services and any other Services that links to this Policy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Please review this Policy carefully. By using the Services, you agree to the personal data practices explained below. If you do not agree with these practices, please do not use the Services, or otherwise provide us with your personal information.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may modify this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you by the email address specified in your account or by means of notice through the Services prior to the change becoming effective. Amendments to the Policy are effective immediately when posted on this site. Your continued use of the Services after posting of amendments will be deemed your acceptance of the changes to this Policy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the date it was “Last Updated” above.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Collection of Information</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you interact with us and our Services, including through a connected Product, TeleVisit will collect information about you, including “personal information” and “non-identifying information.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Personal information” means information about you that specifically identifies you or, when combined with other information we have, can be used to identify you, such as name, telephone number, email address, physical address, images, audio and payment information.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Non-identifying information” means information that alone cannot directly identify you, such as product serial numbers, log data that automatically records information about your visit, such as your browser type, domains, page views, the URL of the page that referred you, the URL of the page you next visit, your IP address, and page navigation, unique device ID collected from Products and your mobile devices, data from cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons, the country and time zone of the connected Product, data about the operation Product and the environment the Product is operating in, geo-location, mobile phone carrier identification, and device software platform and firmware information.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You acknowledge that you have received permission from any persons using the Services to access their data and enter their information on their behalf in the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2. How We Collect Your Information</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">TeleVisit collects personal information about you through the Services in several ways.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you register with Services and activate Products: You voluntarily provide us with personal information when you create your account to use Services or register a Product for online access (“Account”).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you use the Services: TeleVisit requires the use of the camera and microphone on the users’ devices so that they may participate in audio and video conference activities. There is no recording of audio or video from the users, except for cases of technical support. Such recordings are only accessed by authorized staff and are erased once the issues are resolved. The recordings or information derived from them will not be transferred or sold to any third parties.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you contact us for support: When you respond to our e-mails, contact our customer service, or use other customer support tools, we collect your information to provide you with support, verify your identity with your Account profile information.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TeleVisit collects non-identifying information through the Services in several ways.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you use the Services to help us understand how you are using the service, improve Services, and support: TeleVisit often collects industry-standard non-identifying information when you access our Services. We collect this type of information to provide you with a more relevant experience, to prevent misuse, and to ensure that our Services are working properly. We may also record adjustments you make to our Products through the Services. We store this information along with data collected directly by your Product. If you have questions about the security and privacy settings of your mobile device, please refer to instructions from your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings. We also use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and other technologies to keep records, store your preferences, improve our advertising, and collect certain non-identifying information, like log data and device data. In particular, we use cookies that allow us to connect your Services activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with Services. This allows us to better understand how you use our Services and Products, diagnose and troubleshoot any problems you're having, and otherwise administer and improve our Services and Products. The use of cookies also helps you to smoothly navigate our Services. We may also engage one or more third party service providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf via Services. They may use a pixel tag or other similar technology to collect anonymous information about your visits to sites, and they may use that information to target advertisements for our Products and Services. This information is collected anonymously, in a manner that does not personally identify you. For more information regarding this practice and to opt-out of such collection and use of this information by our third party service providers, please see Networkadvertising.org.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you elect to visit a third party site from the Services: Our Services may also contain links to other websites operated by third parties and may include social media features such as Facebook and Twitter buttons (such as “Like,” “Tweet” or “Pin”). We record your interaction with these links.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Operational Data: When you use the Product’s various features, we may collect and process operational data from the Product such as temperature, ambient light, activity and energy usage. This may include capturing and emailing to you portions of this data as part of a notification or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. We may process information from your Product so that we can send you alerts when something happens.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Policy does not apply to the collection of information in any way other than as listed above.<br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3. Your Choices</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know more about you and your preferences. However, you can limit the information you provide to TeleVisit as well as the communications you receive from TeleVisit through your Account preferences.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Commercial E-mails</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may choose not to receive commercial e-mails from us by following the instructions contained in any of the commercial e-mails we send or by logging into your Account and adjusting your e-mail preferences. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from commercial email messages, we may still e-mail you non-commercial e-mails related to your Account and your transactions on the Services.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Cookies and Tracking</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may manage how your mobile device and browser handles Cookies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. Mobile devices and browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your device and browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be available. While you may choose to block or not allow the use of Cookies, doing so may impair your use of Services. Currently, we do not alter our data collection and use practices in response to Do Not Track signals.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can opt-out of being targeted by certain Third-Party Ad-Servers and TeleVisit served ads online using the National Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool, the About Ads Opt-Out Tool, or on TRUSTe’s site.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Device Data</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share certain device data with TeleVisit by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4.

We also may use information collected as described in this Policy with your consent or as otherwise required or permitted by law.<br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">5. How We Share Your Information</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The following are the limited situations where we may share personal information:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We use service providers, vendors, technicians and other third-parties to help us process, store, and protect some of your data and otherwise help us administer our Products and Services effectively, provide a better user experience, process your purchases, and increase the quality of our Products and Services. These third-parties are prohibited from using your personal information for non-TeleVisit purposes and are required to protect your information in accordance with this Policy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may provide information to third-parties if we believe in good faith that we are required by law to do so. For example, to comply with legal orders and government requests; response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate; to protect the interests of our customers and users of the TeleVisit Service; to respond to claims that any content posted or displayed using the TeleVisit Service violates the rights of third parties; in an emergency protect the health and safety of users of the TeleVisit Service or the general public; or to enforce compliance with our Terms of Service.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If TeleVisit and/or all or part of our assets are ever sold or transferred, your personal information may be among the items sold or transferred.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We share information to protect our own legitimate business interests when we believe in good faith that we are required or permitted by law to do so. For example, we may share your personal information as needed to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions; to combat fraud or criminal activity; to protect our rights or those of our affiliates and users; or as part of legal proceedings affecting TeleVisit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may also disclose non-identifiable information (for example, aggregated or anonymized data) publicly or with third-parties. For example, we may share non-identifiable information:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">for the same reasons we might share Personal information;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">to better understand how our customers interact with our Services and Products, in order to optimize your experience, improve our products, or provide better services;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">for our own research and data analytics;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">with our vendors for their own analysis and research;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">to facilitate targeted content and ads;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">with Third-Party Ad-Servers to place our ads on the Services and on third-party sites, and to analyze the effectiveness of those ads; or</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">for any lawful purpose.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by Third-Party Ad-Servers, and TeleVisit is not responsible for cookies or other tracking technology in third party ads.

You can access and update your personal information via your Account profile. While we are ready to assist you in managing your subscriptions, deactivating your account, and removing your active profile and data, we cannot always delete records of past interactions and transactions.
