        <h3>Legal Process.</h3>
        <p>
          It may be necessary — by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests
          from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of
          residence — for PagerDuty to disclose your PII. We may also disclose your
          PII if we determine disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our
          terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Business Transfer.</h3>
        <p>
          We may share your PII if PagerDuty engages in a merger, acquisition,
          bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of
          PagerDuty’s assets, financing acquisition of all or a portion of our
          business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation
          of such activities (e.g. due diligence).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We may also disclose your PII with your prior informed consent. Service
      providers acting on our behalf are obliged to adhere to confidentiality
      requirements no less protective than those set forth herein and will only
      receive access to your PII as necessary to perform their functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may transfer PII (including personal data about residents of the EEA
      and Switzerland) to our vendors, consultants and other service providers
      who need access to such PII to carry out work on our behalf. PagerDuty
      will be liable for the processing of such PII by a third party service
      provider unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event
      giving rise to the damages. We may also be required to disclose such PII
      in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet
      national security or law enforcement requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>How We Protect Your Data — Security</h2>
    <p>
      We are committed to protecting the security of information received via
      the Online Services, including PII. We provide reasonable and appropriate
      administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your
      PII from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we use
      secure socket layer technology (SSL) in connection with our Online
      Services. We also require you to enter a password to access your account
      information. Please do not disclose your account password to anyone else.
      Despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% risk-free, and
      PagerDuty does not warrant or guarantee that your PII will be secure in
      all circumst ances. To learn more about our current security practices and
      policies, please view our <a href="/information-security-practices/">
      Information Security Practices</a>; we keep this document updated as these
      practices evolve over time.

        <p>
          Marketing communications: We offer you choices regarding the
          collection, use, and sharing of your PII. Where permitted by
          applicable law, we will periodically send you communications that
          directly promote our Services. When you receive such communications
          from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further
          communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out”
          by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the
          communications you receive, managing your preferences (e.g.

            marketing email notification preferences</a>) or by contacting us
          directly. Despite your indicated marketing communication preferences,
          we may continue to send you operational messages, including notices of
          any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.

          Alliance AdChoices Program for websites (www.youradchoices.com) and mobile
          applications (www.aboutads.info/appchoices), or in the Network Advertising
          Initiative’s opt out program for certain targeted advertising for websites
          (www.networkadvertising.org/choices) and mobile applications
          (www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice). Please be aware that, even if
          you are able to opt out of certain kinds of interest-based ads, you will
          continue to receive non-targeted ads.

        <h3>Ability to Edit or Delete Your PII.</h3>
        <p>
          You may edit certain PII in your account on the Online Services,
          including contact information and/or notification settings, by editing
          your account profile. You may also request that we delete your account
          information by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@pagerduty.com">support@pagerduty.com</a>, but
          please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this
          information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a
          certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request
          only after we have fulfilled such requirements). PagerDuty will
          respond to such requests within thirty (30) days or sooner if required
          by applicable law. When we delete account information, it will be
          deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives for a
          limited amount of time. We will otherwise retain your information for
          as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you with the
          Online Services you have requested, or as necessary to comply with our
          legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

        <h3>Information Processed Under the Direction of Customers.</h3>
        <p>
          If an organization has registered for the Online Services (a
          “<strong>Customer</strong>“) and your PII has been collected by
          PagerDuty as a result of such organization’s use of the Online
          Services, PagerDuty collects and processes any such PII of yours under
          the directions of the relevant Customer. If these circumstances apply
          to you and you wish to access, edit, delete or exercise any rights you
          may have under applicable data protection laws with respect to any PII
          that we have collected about you, please direct your query to the
          relevant Customer as this may expedite the completion of your request.
          We nevertheless provide reasonable assistance to our Customers to give
          effect to data subject rights as appropriate and required by
          applicable laws.

          California law requires that we detail the categories of Personal Data
          that we collect, use, and disclose for certain “business purposes”.
          These practices are described in Sections II (“What Data We Collect”),

        <p>
          If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain
          requests about your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA
          allows you to request us to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or
            disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the
            business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information;
            and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal
            information.
          </li>

        <p>
          The CCPA further provides you with the right not to be discriminated
          against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.
          Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests
          under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to
          provide our services to you. We also will take reasonable steps to verify
          your identity before responding to a request. In doing so, we may ask you
          for verification information so that we can match at least two
          verification points with information we maintain in our files about you.
          If we are unable to verify you through this method, we shall have the
          right, but not the obligation, to request additional information from you.

        <p>
          Please also note that if your personal information has been collected by

          this may expedite the completion of your request. We nevertheless provide

<h2 class="text-md font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement</h2>

<div class="border px-4">
  <p>
    <strong>Scope:</strong> This Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement is relevant
    to any individual located in the European Economic Area who uses or visits
    PagerDuty’s Online Services where these services directly link to this
    Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement does not cover any other data
    collection or processing, including, without limitation, through other
    PagerDuty Websites or online services that do not display a direct link to
    this Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement, or through third-party websites.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  European Union Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of
  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
  movement of such data (“<strong>EU GDPR</strong>“), requires PagerDuty to
  provide additional and different information about its data processing
  practices to data subjects in the European Economic Area
  (“<strong>EEA</strong>“). If you are accessing the Online Services from a
  member state of the EEA, this Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement applies to
  you.
</p>
<p>
  PagerDuty, Inc., 600 Townsend St., #200, San Francisco, CA 94103, is the data
  controller, and can be contacted at <a href="mailto:privacy@pagerduty.com">privacy@pagerduty.com</a>. Its
  representative in the EU is Adam Brogden and can be contacted at <a href="mailto:contact@gdprlocal.com">contact@gdprlocal.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Legal Basis of Processing</strong>. In general, the legal basis for
  PagerDuty’s processing of your personal data in connection with the Online
  Services is Article 6(1)(b) of the EU GDPR, which allows processing of
  personal data as necessary for the performance of a contract. When you access,
  use or register for our Online Services, you form a contract with us based on
  the applicable terms of use or terms of service, and PagerDuty needs to
  process your personal data to provide the requested Online Services.
</p>
<p>
  As exceptions, PagerDuty relies on your consent with respect to cookies that
  are not strictly necessary and direct marketing emails per Article 6(1)(a) of
  the EU GDPR; and pursues legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the EU
  GDPR with respect to situations where PagerDuty needs to process your personal
  data for other purposes listed in Section 3.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Personal Data Transfers outside of the EEA</strong>. PagerDuty may
  transmit some of your personal data to a country where the data protection
  laws may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your
  jurisdiction, including the United States. As required by applicable law,
  PagerDuty, Inc. will provide an adequate level of protection for your personal
  data using various means, including, where appropriate:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    relying on a formal decision by the European Commission that a certain
    country ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data (a full
    list of such decisions may be accessed online here:
    <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm">
      http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm
    </a>);
  </li>
  <li>
    entering into appropriate data transfer agreements based on language
    approved by the European Commission, such as the Standard Contractual
    Clauses (2010/87/EC and/or 2004/915/EC), which are available upon request at
    <a href="mailto:privacy@pagerduty.com">privacy@pagerduty.com</a>;
  </li>
  <li>
    implementing appropriate physical, technical and organizational security
    measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful
    destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or
    access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing; and
  </li>
  <li>
    taking other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection in
    accordance with applicable law.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any onward transfer is subject to appropriate onward transfer requirements as
  required by applicable law.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Data Retention</strong>. PagerDuty keeps personal data as long as
  required to provide the Services you have requested or registered for and
  comply with applicable laws.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Data Subject Rights</strong>. You have a right to request from
  PagerDuty access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data or
  restriction of processing concerning you, as well as the right to data
  portability under the EU GDPR. You also have the right to object, on grounds
  relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your
  personal data by us and we can be required to no longer process your personal
  data. In general, you have the right to object to our processing of your
  personal data for direct marketing purposes. If you have a right to object and
  you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for
  such purposes by us. You can exercise such rights by accessing the information
  in your account, submitting a request
  <a href="https://tickets.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">here</a>,
  and/or by emailing
  <a href="mailto:privacy@pagerduty.com">privacy@pagerduty.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you have provided consent for cookies that are not strictly necessary,
  direct marketing emails or other data processing based on your consent, you
  have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the
  lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. You have the
  right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Profiling</strong>. PagerDuty does not use in connection with the
  Online Services automated decision-making, including profiling, in a way that
  produces legal effects concerning you or which significantly affects you.
