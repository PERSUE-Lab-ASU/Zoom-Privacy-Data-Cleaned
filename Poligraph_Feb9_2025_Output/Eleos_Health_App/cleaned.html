				<p>This is the privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) that governs how we, Eleos Health, Inc. (“Eleos”, “we”, “our” or “us”), use Personal Information (defined below) that we collect, receive and store about individuals in connection with the use of: (i) the website www.eleos.health, and any other website that we operate (each, together with its subdomains, content and services, a “Site”); and (ii) the Eleos mobile software application (the “App”). The Site and the App are individually and collectively referred to herein as the “Services”.</p>
<p>We do not ourselves host any of the Services – all hosting is done by third-party service providers that we engage. This means that data you provide us or that we collect from you (including any Personal Information, as defined below) – as further described in this Privacy Policy – is hosted with such third-party service providers on servers that they own or control. Regardless of where such third-party service providers are located (and some are located in the US), their servers may be located anywhere in the world (including the US). Your data may even be replicated across multiple servers located in multiple countries. So please be aware that you are consenting to your data being transferred to various third-party service providers around the world (including the US).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction.</strong>&nbsp;We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Services. “Personal Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, a home or other physical address, or other contact information.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use and SAAS AGREEMENT.</strong>&nbsp;This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use which is available at https://eleos.health/terms-of-service (“Terms”) and the App’s Software as a Service License Agreement which can be viewed from within the App and which you accepted prior to downloading, installing and/or using the App for the first time (“SaaS Agreement”). Any capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to it in the Terms.</li>
<li><strong>Consent and Modification.</strong>&nbsp;You are not legally obligated to provide us Personal Information, and you hereby confirm that providing us Personal Information is at your own free will. By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing, and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of the Services thereafter means that you accept those changes.</li>
<li><strong>What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It.</strong>&nbsp;We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Site. But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:
<ol>
<li>Account. In order to use certain services that we offer via the Service, you may be required to create an account (“Account”). If you create an Account you will be required to provide us with certain information, such as your name, email address, phone number, your organization name, your clinical degree, your position and title, your clinic’s site, as well as a password that you will use for your Account (“Account Information”). You may also choose to provide additional Personal Information as part of the Account registration process and in connection with your ongoing use of your Account. We may send you a text message to your mobile phone or an e-mail to the e-mail address you submit to confirm your registration. If you choose not to create an Account, you may not be able to access or use certain features of the Service.</li>
<li>Regardless of which method you choose to register your Account, we may send an email to your nominated email address to instruct you on how to confirm your registration.</li>
<li>‘Contact Us’ Information. If you send us a “Contact Us” request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available or by sending an email to an email address that we display, you may be required to provide us with certain information such as your name and email address.</li>
<li>Recorded Session Data. The App enables the recording of sessions you may participate in with your patients (“Session Recordings”). Your Session Recordings will include anything you may say during the session/s in which the App is used.</li>
<li>Log Files. We may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movement around the Services, and gather demographic information.</li>
<li>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Our Services may utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers and other tracking technologies in order for us to provide our Services and present you with information that is customized for you. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about activity on the Services. Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address, previously indicated by a user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.</li>
<li>Mobile Device Data. We may collect limited information from your mobile device in order to provide the App. Such information may include your mobile device type, mobile device id, and the date and time stamps of App use. In addition, we may deploy tracking technologies within the App to help us gather aggregate statistics, but we will not use Personal Information for such purposes.</li>
<li>Mixpanel Analytics. The Site may use a tool called “Mixpanel Analytics” to collect information about the use of the Service. Mixpanel Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Service, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Service. We use the information we get from Mixpanel Analytics to maintain and improve the Service and our products. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Mixpanel Analytics with personally identifiable information. Mixpanel’s ability to use and share information collected by Mixpanel Analytics about your visits to and use of the Service is restricted by the Mixpanel Analytics Terms of Service, available at https://mixpanel.com/legal/terms-of-use, and the Mixpanel Privacy Policy, available at https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/. You may learn more about how Mixpanel collects and processes data specifically in connection with Mixpanel Analytics at https://mixpanel.com/legal/terms-of-use/</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The Way We Use Personal Information.</strong>&nbsp;If you submit or we collect Personal Information through the Services, then we may use such Personal Information in the following ways, via any applicable communication channel, including e-mail, SMS, etc.:
<ol>
<li>We will use your Personal Information to provide and improve our Services, to send you marketing/advertisement communications that we believe may be of interest to you, to contact you in connection with the Services and certain programs or offerings that you may have registered for, and to identify and authenticate your access to the parts of the Services that you are authorized to access.</li>
<li>We may use your designated email address to: (i) send you updates or news regarding the Services and our products; and/or (ii) respond to a “Contact Us” or administrative request (for example, to change your password).</li>
<li>We may transfer your Personal Information to our local or foreign subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of storing or processing such information on our behalf. Such information may be transferred to other countries. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>We may share your Personal Information with our third-party service providers and partners, but only to assist us with our business operations and to provide our Services to you and other users. Such information may be transferred to other countries. We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third-party service providers and partners that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personal Information.</li>
<li>We may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via the Services if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our Terms and SaaS Agreement, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Eleos, our users, yourself or the public.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Use of Anonymous Information.</strong>&nbsp;We may use Anonymous Information (as defined below) or disclose it to third-party service providers in order to improve our Services and enhance your experience with the Services. We may also disclose Anonymous Information (with or without compensation) to third parties, including advertisers and partners. “Anonymous Information” means information that does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information about the use of our Services.</li>
<li><strong>Opting Out.</strong>&nbsp;You may choose not to receive future promotional, advertising, or other Services-related emails from us by selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that we send. Please note that even if you opt-out of receiving the foregoing emails, we may still send you a response to any “Contact Us” request as well as administrative emails (for example, in connection with a password reset request) that are necessary to facilitate your use of the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Choice.</strong>&nbsp;At all times, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information. If you choose not to provide mandatory Personal Information, you may still visit parts of the Services but you may be unable to access certain options, programs, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.</li>
<li><strong>Access/Accuracy.</strong>&nbsp;To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information. If you would like to delete or correct any of your other Personal Information that we may be storing, you may use the tools that we make available on the Services or you may submit an access request by sending an email to info@eleos.test. Your email should include adequate details of your request.</li>
<li><strong>Links to and Interaction with Third Party Products.</strong>&nbsp;The Services may enable you to interact with or contain links to your Third-Party Account and other third-party websites, mobile software applications and services that are not owned or controlled by us (each a “Third Party Service”). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Third Party Services. Please be aware that Third-Party Services may collect Personal Information from you. Accordingly, we encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party Service that you choose to use or interact with.</li>
<li><strong>Children’s Privacy.</strong>&nbsp;The Services are not structured to attract children under the age of 13 years. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 years, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at info@eleos.test.</li>
<li><strong>Security.</strong>&nbsp;The security of Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information submitted to us. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use reasonably acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about security on the Service, you can contact us at info@eleos.test.</li>
<li><strong>Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy.</strong>&nbsp;In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Information in connection with the foregoing events.</li>
<li><strong>California Privacy Rights.</strong>&nbsp;California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to info@eleos.test. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year.</li>
<li><strong>Our California Do Not Track Notice.</strong>&nbsp;We do not track consumers over time and across third-party websites and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track signals. We do not allow third-parties to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion of Content from California Residents.</strong>&nbsp;If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and a registered user, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to remove content or Personal Information you have publicly posted. If you wish to remove such content or Personal Information and you specify which content or Personal Information you wish to be removed, we will do so in accordance with applicable law. Please be aware that after removal you will not be able to restore removed content. In addition, such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or Personal Information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require us to enable removal of content.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</strong>&nbsp;Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and we are constantly evolving our Service to meet these demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy or your Personal Information that we may be storing and using, please contact us at info@eleos.test.</li>
