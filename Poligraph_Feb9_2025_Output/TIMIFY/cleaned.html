Other Special Data Processing </strong></h2><h3><br><strong>1. Newsletter </strong></h3>When you subscribe to our email newsletter, we process only your email address. The data will be used exclusively to provide you with regular updates about our products and promotions. The data processing is based on your consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. The legality of data processing activities already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation..<h3><br><strong>2. Contact Form&nbsp;</strong></h3>We provide a contact form on our website for interested parties and customers to ask questions and receive information about our services. The requests and information directed to us in this context are processed only to handle your inquiry and to contact you (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). We store your data for the duration of any resulting contractual relationship with you (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR). There is no legal or contractual obligation to provide your data, but contacting us without providing your data is not possible. If such a contractual relationship does not result from the inquiry, we will delete your data no later than three (3) years after the last contact with you. The right to object to the processing in advance or to request deletion remains unaffected, of course.<h3><br><strong>3. Google Maps</strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span></h3>We use Google Maps (API) on our website. The operator of Google Maps is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Maps is a web service for displaying interactive (land) maps to visually represent geographical information. When you access a page that includes Google Maps, your browser loads the web fonts required to display Google Maps into your browser cache. For this purpose as well, the browser you are using establishes a connection to Google's servers. As a result, Google becomes aware that our website has been accessed via your IP address. This occurs regardless of whether Google provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether there is no user account. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly associated with your account. If you do not wish to be associated with your profile on Google, you must log out of your Google user account. Google stores your data (even for users who are not logged in) as usage profiles and evaluates them. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles; to exercise this right, you must contact Google. These processing activities occur exclusively with the granting of explicit consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. As part of this processing, personal data may also be transferred to third countries outside the European Economic Area, particularly the USA. The transfer of data to the USA takes place pursuant to Article 45(1) GDPR based on the European Commission's adequacy decision. The participating US company and/or their US subcontractors are certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). In cases where no adequacy decision of the European Commission exists (including US companies that are not certified under EU-U.S. DPF), we have agreed with the recipients of the data other suitable safeguards within the meaning of Articles 44 ff. GDPR. You can view Google Maps' privacy policy here: ("Google Privacy Policy"):&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>).<br>&nbsp;<h2><strong>D. Data Processing when Using TIMIFY </strong><strong> </strong></h2><h3><br><strong>1. Registration as a Service Provider </strong><strong> </strong></h3><p>When you wish to use TIMIFY as a service provider, during your registration and the creation of your user account, we process what is initially referred to as registration data (e.g., contact person in the form of first and last name, email address), login data (email address, password), as well as connection data generated when accessing the website (IP address). We process these data to provide you with access to your user account. The login data is used to verify your customer account (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR). The data will not be shared with unauthorized third parties. We store this data for the duration of your customer account, but for a maximum of three (3) years after its termination, unless you request deletion earlier and there are no other legal retention and storage obligations. The provision of the aforementioned personal data is contractually required, as otherwise, the use of the customer account and the management of your account are not possible. &nbsp;</p><ol><li>TIMIFY Appointment Booking Data<br>Through the account, you can create your company profile, enter appointments, services, and employee data, and analyze booking behavior using our statistical tools. Through the dashboard, you also have the option to customize the appointment booking solution according to your individual preferences. All personal data collected or processed by you in this context will be processed by us solely within the framework of the data processing agreement concluded between the service provider and TerminApp. Consequently, the service provider is responsible in terms of data protection. TerminApp will process all personal data solely according to the company's instructions. This also includes the fact that all data processed using TIMIFY, particularly, is not deleted by TerminApp, nor are any deletion instructions provided. The responsibility for this lies with the service provider, who also has the option to make the corresponding settings through their account. However, TerminApp reserves the right to analyze and use the appointment booking data for its own purposes, provided that these analyses are anonymous and therefore do not contain any personal references.</li><li>TIMIFY Payment Processing<br>In connection with an order, payment processing, and delivery, we process your customer data, connection data (IP address), and payment data (e.g., payment information) in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The data will not be shared with unauthorized third parties. We store the data collected for contract processing for the duration of the contractual relationship, unless you request deletion earlier, but at least until the expiration of the statutory warranty claims. After these periods, we retain the information necessary for the contractual relationship according to commercial and tax law for the legally determined periods. Depending on the payment method you have chosen, the payment information will be transmitted to the corresponding payment service provider (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR). Details on these providers can be found in your user account.</li></ol><h3><strong>2. Appointment Bookers&nbsp;</strong></h3>When you book an appointment via TIMIFY or use the accessible functions, the data protection responsibility lies with the respective provider (owner of the website where the appointment booking tool is used). In this regard as well, TerminApp acts solely as a processor bound by instructions. Therefore, TerminApp claims no "rights" to any data that users collect through the "TIMIFY" application, nor does it carry out any adjustments, deletions, or modifications of this data. For instance, if an appointment booker requests data deletion, they must contact the person responsible for the website. If TerminApp is the data protection responsible entity (because the appointment booker wishes to schedule an appointment with TerminApp), TerminApp only requires your email address to manage the appointment and send corresponding reminders for the meeting (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). Your data will be stored for a duration corresponding to a resulting contractual relationship with you (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR). If such a contractual relationship does not arise due to the appointment booking, we will delete your data at the latest twenty-four (24) months after the last appointment booking. The right to object to the processing or to request deletion prior to that remains unaffected.<h3><br><strong>3. Apps and Applications in TIMIFY </strong></h3>Through TIMIFY, service providers can add and use various third-party apps. For details about the nature and scope of the data processing involved, please refer to the respective privacy information of these app providers.<h2><br><br><strong>E. Applications&nbsp;</strong></h2>Information about the nature and scope of data processing in the event that you submit your application documents to us will be provided separately in the "Career" section.&nbsp;<h2><br><br><strong>F. Social&nbsp;Media</strong></h2>We operate profiles on online platforms and social networks to interact with potential or existing customers, engage with interested parties and users, or promote offers and services. We operate our profiles in so-called joint (data protection-related) responsibility with the providers. Data that you share or publish directly through the online platforms and networks (e.g., through comment and chat functions) is processed by us as the data controller, in order to possibly interact with you in that regard or to exchange information with you. As part of this interaction, we may also receive statistical data about the use of our "channels and fan pages" from the platform operators. This includes information about interactions, likes, comments, or summarized information and statistics (e.g., IP address; origin of followers) that help us learn about interactions with our page. The legal basis for data processing in our area of responsibility is Art. 6(1), sentence 1, lit. f) of the GDPR. However, the providers also process data in their own responsibility. We have no control over data processed by the provider in their own responsibility according to their own terms of use and privacy policies. Please note that when accessing the aforementioned providers, additional data (e.g., from your usage and "browsing behavior") may be collected and possibly transmitted to the provider. Please also note that in the case of interaction through the aforementioned media, data may be processed outside the European Union. Furthermore, user data is typically processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage behavior and resulting user interests can be used to create user profiles. These user profiles can in turn be used to display advertisements within and outside the platforms, which presumably correspond to the users' interests. Further information on this can be found in the privacy information of the respective providers. If we have personal data from you in connection with the use of online platforms and networks, please direct your inquiries to us. If you wish to assert rights against a specific provider, please contact the respective provider.&nbsp;<h2><br><br><strong>G. Your Rights&nbsp;</strong></h2>You can assert your rights as a data subject with regard to your processed personal data at any time vis-à-vis us using the contact details provided at the beginning. You have the following rights in particular: Art. 15 GDPR - Right to information about your data processed by us. In particular, you can request information about the purposes of processing, the categories of data, the categories of recipients to whom your data have been or will be disclosed, the planned storage period, the existence of a right to correction, deletion, restriction of processing or objection, the existence of a right of complaint, the origin of your data, if it has not been collected by us, and the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about its details.&nbsp;<br><br>Art. 18 GDPR - Right to restriction of processing of the data.&nbsp;<br>Art. 20 GDPR - Right to receive your data ("data portability").&nbsp;<br>Art. 21 GDPR - Right to object to processing, if processing is based on Art. 6(1), sentence 1, lit. e) or lit. f) of the GDPR.<br>Art. 77 GDPR - Right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority.<br><br><br>As of: August 14, 2023<br>&nbsp;</div></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div></div> <div class="page-overlay"></div></div><noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-PP8CPSV"height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript>
