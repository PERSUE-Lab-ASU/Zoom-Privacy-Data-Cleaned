In this regard as well, TerminApp acts solely as a processor bound by instructions. Therefore, TerminApp claims no \"rights\" to any data that users collect through the \"TIMIFY\" application, nor does it carry out any adjustments, deletions, or modifications of this data. For instance, if an appointment booker requests data deletion, they must contact the person responsible for the website. If TerminApp is the data protection responsible entity (because the appointment booker wishes to schedule an appointment with TerminApp), TerminApp only requires your email address to manage the appointment and send corresponding reminders for the meeting (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). Your data will be stored for a duration corresponding to a resulting contractual relationship with you (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR). If such a contractual relationship does not arise due to the appointment booking, we will delete your data at the latest twenty-four (24) months after the last appointment booking. The right to object to the processing or to request deletion prior to that remains unaffected."}, {"role": "heading", "name": "3.

We operate our profiles in so-called joint (data protection-related) responsibility with the providers. Data that you share or publish directly through the online platforms and networks (e.g., through comment and chat functions) is processed by us as the data controller, in order to possibly interact with you in that regard or to exchange information with you. As part of this interaction, we may also receive statistical data about the use of our \"channels and fan pages\" from the platform operators. This includes information about interactions, likes, comments, or summarized information and statistics (e.g., IP address; origin of followers) that help us learn about interactions with our page. The legal basis for data processing in our area of responsibility is Art. 6(1), sentence 1, lit. f) of the GDPR. However, the providers also process data in their own responsibility. We have no control over data processed by the provider in their own responsibility according to their own terms of use and privacy policies. Please note that when accessing the aforementioned providers, additional data (e.g., from your usage and \"browsing behavior\") may be collected and possibly transmitted to the provider. Please also note that in the case of interaction through the aforementioned media, data may be processed outside the European Union. Furthermore, user data is typically processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage behavior and resulting user interests can be used to create user profiles. These user profiles can in turn be used to display advertisements within and outside the platforms, which presumably correspond to the users' interests. Further information on this can be found in the privacy information of the respective providers.
