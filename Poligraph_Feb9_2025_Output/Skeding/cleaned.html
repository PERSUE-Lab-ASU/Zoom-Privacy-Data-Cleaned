Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p></div><div class="personal-data"><h4>What is personal data?</h4><p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.<br>‍<br>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li class="list-item-4">Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect</li><li class="list-item-4">Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose.

It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Skeding we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p></div><div class="data-rights"><h4>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h4><p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the&nbsp;data subject rights requirements of GDPR.
