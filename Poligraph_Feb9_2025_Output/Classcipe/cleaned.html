We may rely on the instructions that we receive from the School that we reasonably believe are given by a Child’s Parent to the School.

Notwithstanding any such requests, we may continue to share a Child’s Personal Information with third parties for the Internal Purposes and Enforcement Purposes (each as described above).</p><p>If a Parent chooses to prohibit any future collection, use or disclosure of the Child’s Personal Information, the Parent may do so by terminating the Child’s Account through the School, and requesting the deletion of the Child’s Personal Information through the School. Upon receiving such request from the Child’s School, we will delete the Child’s Account information from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account. Company will not have any liability whatsoever for any termination of the Account or related deletion of the Child’s Personal Information.
