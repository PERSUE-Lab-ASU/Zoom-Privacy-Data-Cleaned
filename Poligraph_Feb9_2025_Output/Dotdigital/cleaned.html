We may partner with and use various third-party software and services, including analytics services, to help understand your usage of our products and services. We provide a limited amount of your information (such as your email address and sign-up date) to select third party services to collect data for analytics purposes when you visit our website or use our products and services. This allows Dotdigital to monitor your use of our website, products and services and tracks our relationship so we can improve our service to you. We may also use these third-party services for communications, either through email, or through messages within our products and services. These third-party services may collect publicly available contact and social information related to you, such as your name, email address, gender, company, job title, photos, website URLs, social network handles and physical addresses, to enhance your user experience.</p>

<p>Calls are recorded under the legal basis of legitimate interest and consent.<br>
All recordings will be retained in line with our retention policy. Information will not be retained for a longer period than necessary.</p>
<p>In addition to calls, Dotdigital uses Zoom to host virtual meetings, which may include the use of Zoom’s AI companion. These features are designed to enhance productivity and collaboration. If you prefer not to have these features enabled during the meeting, please contact the meeting host.<br>
More information on how these features handle data can be found here.</p>
<p>Finally, the Dotdigital sales teams use Gong.io in connection with Zoom to capture and analyse interactions over calls and virtual meetings. This provides us with insights and increases business efficiency. For more information, please click here.</p>
