<p>We may be required or entitled to retain your information to comply with legal and regulatory obligations and to protect and exercise our legal rights and interests.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>14.&nbsp;Marketing</h2>

<p>Where you have given your consent, Freddie Med may store your business contact details for direct marketing purposes and we may contact you about our respective products or services that may be of interest to you or your employer. If you prefer not to receive any direct marketing communications from Freddie Med, you can opt out at any time by following the “unsubscribe” instructions at the bottom of the relevant promotional emails or by managing your email preferences via your accounts settings when you access the demo version of our service.</p>

<h2>15.&nbsp;Opt Out of Online Behavioural Advertising</h2>

<p>When a Freddie Med online behavioural advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an “Ad Choices” icon. Clicking on the icon or link will take you to a website where you can manage or opt out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioural advertising. On your mobile device, you may also have a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting (in iOS devices) or a setting to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (on Android), which allows you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests.</p>

<p>If you opt out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from Freddie Med that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed rather than your prior web-browsing activity). In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behaviour.</p>

<p>To learn more about the choices that advertisers provide generally for individuals to influence how information about their online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services is collected and used, visit the Network Advertising Initiative at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/, or the European Digital Advertising Alliance at http://youronlinechoices.eu/.<br>
