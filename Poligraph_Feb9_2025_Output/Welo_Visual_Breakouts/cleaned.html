<p><strong>In short:</strong> We collect technical data, profile data, content, and other data received from you, your organization and other third-party sources.</p>



<p>We collect and control various types of personal data regarding our Users of our Sites and Apps.

<li id="google-meet-integration"><a href="#google-meet-integration">Google Meet Integration</a> (via Google Meet REST API): We offer integration with Google Meet to facilitate online meetings.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data Collection and Usage:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We only use OAuth to create meetings on your behalf.</li>



<li>We do not access, store, or process any other data related to your Google Meet account, including meeting content, participant information, or meeting recordings.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Permissions: The specific permissions requested via OAuth are limited to the following:
<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Google Chat Integration </strong>“Welo integrates with Google Chat to provide a seamless communication experience. This integration allows you to send messages within your Welo space directly through Google Chat. To do this, Welo uses the following permissions:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Discover or create direct messages: Welo uses the chat.spaces scope to check if a direct message space already exists between two users and create one if needed. This ensures that your Welo messages can be delivered to the correct Google Chat conversations. Welo does not use this permission to access or manage any other spaces in Google Chat.</li>



<li>Send messages on your behalf: Welo uses the chat.messages scope to send messages from your Welo space to your Google Chat conversations. Welo only uses this permission to create and send messages as instructed by you. Welo does not read, store, or archive any message content beyond what is necessary to deliver your messages.</li>



<li>This integration enhances your communication experience by allowing you to send Welo messages without leaving your Google Chat interface. You can opt out of the Google Chat integration or disconnect your Google Chat account at any time within your Welo settings”</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Other Meeting Content and Metadata (does not apply to Google Meet Integration): When you use Welo for audio/video conferencing, we may collect and store meeting content, which may include:

<p><strong>In short:</strong> We share your data with our Service Providers; in accordance with legal compliance requirements; and among other Space Users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use it for a specific purpose.</li>



<li>Legitimate interest: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</li>



<li>Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal data to fulfill the terms of our contract.</li>



<li>Legal Obligations: Although we anticipate such circumstances to be extremely rare, we may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your personal data when we are legally required in order to do so to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. This could happen in response to a court order or a subpoena in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or such disclosure is required to protect the security or integrity of our products and services.</li>



<li>Service Providers: We engage selected third-party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own. Such service providers include providers of cloud infrastructure, video/audio conferencing services (AWS Chime, Zoom Meeting SDK, Zoom Apps SDK and/or Google Meet REST API), communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), data and cyber security services, fraud detection, investigation and prevention services, web and mobile analytics, e-mail and communication distribution and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, social and advertising networks, content providers, e-mail, voicemails, support and customer relation management systems, and our legal, compliance and financial advisors and auditors (collectively, “Service Providers”). These Service Providers may have access to your personal data, depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Service, and may only use it for such limited purposes as determined in our agreements with them.</li>



<li>Partnerships: We engage selected business and channel partners, resellers, distributors and providers of professional services related to our Service (“Partners”), which allow us to explore and pursue growth opportunities by facilitating a stronger local presence and tailored experiences for our prospective and existing Customers and Users. In such instances, we may share relevant contact, business and usage details with the respective Partner, to allow them to engage with those Customers and Users for such purposes. If you directly engage with any of our Partners, please note that any aspect of that engagement which is not directly related to the Service and directed by Welo is beyond the scope of Welo’s Terms and Privacy Policy, and may therefore be governed by the Partner’s terms and privacy policy.</li>



<li>Application Providers and Event Sponsors: if so instructed or permitted by you or your Account Admin, we may share your personal data (such as your User Profile and contact details, as well as relevant usage data) with the provider(s) of any third party applications or integrations added to your Account. Similarly, if you register for any event that we host, organize or sponsor, then with your permission we may share your registration details with others, including the hosts, organizers, speakers, service providers and sponsors of that event, so that they may contact you with relevant information and offers, or to fulfill any promotions related to the event.</li>



<li>Customers and other Users: Your personal data may be shared with the Customer owning the Account to which you are subscribed as a User (including data and communications concerning your User Profile), as well as other Users of that Account or Space. For instance, you may be able to maintain a user profile with information about yourself that you can make available to other users or the public. Your personal data and activity within the Service may also be monitored, processed and analyzed by the Account Admin. This includes instances where you contact us for help in resolving an issue specific to a team of which you are a member (and which is managed by the same Customer). Please note that Welo is not responsible for and does not control any further disclosure, use or monitoring by or on behalf of the Customer (including sharing of boards or use of broadcast features within the Service), that itself acts as the “Data Controller” of such data.</li>



<li>Service integrations: When you access the Space as a User, you or your Account Admin may choose to integrate your Account on the Service with a third-party service (provided that such integration is supported by our Service). The provider of this integrated third-party service may receive certain relevant data about or from your Account on the Service, or share certain relevant data from that account on the third-party provider’s service with our Service, depending on the nature and purpose of such integration. This could include your User Data. Note that we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third-party services (but do typically require and store your authentication token in order to integrate with them). If you do not wish your data to be shared with such third-party service(s), you may elect not to enable such integrations and/or contact your Account Admin.</li>



<li>Protecting Rights and Safety: We may share your personal data with others if we reasonably believe that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of Welo, any of our Users or Customers, or any members of the general public.</li>



<li>Welo Internal and Affiliated Companies: We share personal data internally for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if Welo were to undergo any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all of its assets, your personal data may be shared with the parties involved in such an event. In the event we believe that such change in control might materially affect your personal data then stored with us, we will notify you of this event and the choices you may have via e-mail or prominent notice on our Service.</li>
</ul>



<p>Additional Purposes: For the avoidance of doubt, your personal data may be shared by Welo in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal and anonymous.</p>
