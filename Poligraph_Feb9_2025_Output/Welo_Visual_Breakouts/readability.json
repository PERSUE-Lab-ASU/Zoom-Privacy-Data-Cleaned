This could happen in response to a court order or a subpoena in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or such disclosure is required to protect the security or integrity of our products and services.\n\n\n\nService Providers: We engage selected third-party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own. Such service providers include providers of cloud infrastructure, video/audio conferencing services (AWS Chime, Zoom Meeting SDK, Zoom Apps SDK and/or Google Meet REST API), communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), data and cyber security services, fraud detection, investigation and prevention services, web and mobile analytics, e-mail and communication distribution and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, social and advertising networks, content providers, e-mail, voicemails, support and customer relation management systems, and our legal, compliance and financial advisors and auditors (collectively, \u201cService Providers\u201d).

In such instances, we may share relevant contact, business and usage details with the respective Partner, to allow them to engage with those Customers and Users for such purposes. If you directly engage with any of our Partners, please note that any aspect of that engagement which is not directly related to the Service and directed by Welo is beyond the scope of Welo\u2019s Terms and Privacy Policy, and may therefore be governed by the Partner\u2019s terms and privacy policy.\n\n\n\nApplication Providers and Event Sponsors: if so instructed or permitted by you or your Account Admin, we may share your personal data (such as your User Profile and contact details, as well as relevant usage data) with the provider(s) of any third party applications or integrations added to your Account. Similarly, if you register for any event that we host, organize or sponsor, then with your permission we may share your registration details with others, including the hosts, organizers, speakers, service providers and sponsors of that event, so that they may contact you with relevant information and offers, or to fulfill any promotions related to the event.\n\n\n\nCustomers and other Users: Your personal data may be shared with the Customer owning the Account to which you are subscribed as a User (including data and communications concerning your User Profile), as well as other Users of that Account or Space. For instance, you may be able to maintain a user profile with information about yourself that you can make available to other users or the public. Your personal data and activity within the Service may also be monitored, processed and analyzed by the Account Admin. This includes instances where you contact us for help in resolving an issue specific to a team of which you are a member (and which is managed by the same Customer). Please note that Welo is not responsible for and does not control any further disclosure, use or monitoring by or on behalf of the Customer (including sharing of boards or use of broadcast features within the Service), that itself acts as the \u201cData Controller\u201d of such data.\n\n\n\nService integrations: When you access the Space as a User, you or your Account Admin may choose to integrate your Account on the Service with a third-party service (provided that such integration is supported by our Service). The provider of this integrated third-party service may receive certain relevant data about or from your Account on the Service, or share certain relevant data from that account on the third-party provider\u2019s service with our Service, depending on the nature and purpose of such integration. This could include your User Data. Note that we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third-party services (but do typically require and store your authentication token in order to integrate with them). If you do not wish your data to be shared with such third-party service(s), you may elect not to enable such integrations and/or contact your Account Admin.\n\n\n\nProtecting Rights and Safety: We may share your personal data with others if we reasonably believe that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of Welo, any of our Users or Customers, or any members of the general public.\n\n\n\nWelo Internal and Affiliated Companies: We share personal data internally for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

This means that even though we stop processing your personal data for one purpose, we may still need to keep your personal data, if the data is needed for another purpose, using it only for that other purpose. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data, we will either delete or pseudonymise such information, or, if this is not possible then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we keep your data safe?\n\n\n\nIn short: We aim to protect your personal data through a system of organizational and technical security measures.\n\n\n\nYour data is protected by industry-standard physical, procedural and technical security measures, including encryption as appropriate.
