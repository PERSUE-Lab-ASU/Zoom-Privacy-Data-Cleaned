For instance, we may track whether our customers use certain of our Services at certain times, in certain ways, or from certain countries, and we may analyze that information to help us provide better or more efficient Services. (For instance, if we see many IP addresses from a particular country, we may increase our server capacity in those countries; if we see significant interaction with certain web pages or platform features, we may incorporate that knowledge into our Service offerings.)</p><h2>3.
