<h2><b> Online Advertising</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of advertising about our Services on other websites You visit and other applications You use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page You are visiting, information You enter such as Your age and gender, Your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from You. These ads may be based on Your current activity or Your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to Your interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to help deliver these tailored advertising on other websites and in mobile applications. These third parties may place cookies or other tracking technologies on Your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about Your use of the Services as discussed above and may access these cookies or other tracking technologies on Your computer, mobile phone, or other device You use to access the Services to serve these tailored advertisements. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of Your email address that is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you, solely in non-human readable form and content that You share publicly when using the services (e.g, user- generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on Your computer, mobile phone, or other device You use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer You a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on Your computer through a web browser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using a mobile application, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, You may still receive advertisements on other websites and mobile applications even if You opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to Your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices You make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the extent applicable, by opting-in to receive text messages from us or by sending us an initial text message, you agree to receive text messages (a.k.a. SMS messages) from Juno, some of which may be considered marketing and may be delivered by us using autodialer systems/technologies. You also represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the mobile device that you used to subscribe for our mobile communications and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges, as applicable. You (and not Juno) will be responsible for all messaging and data charges that may apply. You can opt-out of receiving text messages from us at any time by texting “STOP” from the mobile device receiving the messages.

<br>
Juno Journey Ltd. (“Juno”, We”, “Us”, or “Our”) respects Your rights regarding Your privacy and information, and We provide this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to help You understand how We collect, use, share, store and disclose information We obtain from or about You when You use Our Services (as defined below). This Privacy Policy applies to when You use Our Services, unless We provide a link to a different policy. Any version of this Privacy Policy in a language other than English is provided for convenience only and You understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict with any non-English versions. As used herein, the term “use” shall mean use, access, install, sign into, connect with, download, visit or browse Juno’s proprietary AI-powered personalization platform that seeks to build individualized training solutions for those individuals who use and engage with it (the “Services”).<br>
<br>
THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND Juno, AND BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
<br>
If you are a California resident, please refer to our California Data Privacy Notice.<br>
<br>
You should review this Privacy Policy in conjunction with any other agreement or policy provided by Us that governs Your use of the Services. You should not use the Services if You do not agree with this Privacy Policy and any other agreement or policy that governs Your use of the Services.<br>
<br>
1. Information You Provide to Us Directly<br>
Juno may collect different information from or about You depending on the manner in which You use the Services. The following examples are provided to help You better understand the information We may collect through Your use of the Services. Please note — Juno is not responsible for how others use information that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to others who have access to the Services. <br>
<br>
When You use the Services (including through a third-party platform), We collect the information You submit thereon such as the following:<br>
<br>
Registration Information: Registration information such as Your e-mail address, password, and phone number (“Registration Information”).<br>
Profile Information: You may also have the option of providing additional information about Yourself, including but not limited to a photo, resume/curriculum vitae, headline, website link, social media profile(s), phone number, or other information you may choose to enter (“Profile Information”) to create a profile (“Profile”). Your Profile and Profile Information will be publicly viewable to others.<br>
Public Posting / Shared Content: Some of the Services may allow You to interact with other Users and/or post, share, communicate or otherwise transmit content publicly, such as posting comments on a Course page, sending messages to others, or posting photos (collectively “Shared Content” or “Public Posting”). We may collect and store Public Postings and Shared Content. Shared Content or Public Postings may be publicly available or viewable by others depending on where such content is posted. You hereby grant Juno a non-exclusive right and license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, offer, market and otherwise use and exploit the Public Postings and Shared Content.<br>
Information Received Through a Third Party Platform: The Services may contain third party links or allow You to access the Services through Third Party Platforms, such as Facebook and/or Your employer’s site. If You use Our Services on or through a Third Party Platform via any means or devices (“Wireless Devices”), or click on third party links, the collection, use, and disclosure of Your information and Your use of the Services will also be subject to the privacy policies and other terms of such third parties or Third Party Platforms. You should review such privacy policies, terms, and other agreements. When You use Our Services through a Third Party Platform, You allow Us to collect and use certain information from Your Third Party Platform profile or account as permitted by the terms of that Third Party Platform, Your privacy settings and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By way of example only, We may collect some or all of the following information from Your Third Party Platform account when You register or use the Services on or through a Third Party Platform: (i) Your full name; (ii) Your profile picture or its URL; (iii) Your employment details (i.e., title, responsibilities, number of years of employment, etc.) and (iv) Your physical location and that of Your access devices, including any Wireless Device<br>
Sweepstakes, promotions, and Surveys: From time to time, We may ask You to complete a survey and/or offer You the opportunity to participate in promotions and/or sweepstakes (collectively, “Promotions”) via the Services or through a Third Party Platform. If You choose to participate in a Promotion, We will collect and store the information You provide in connection with Your participation in the Promotion, including, but not limited to, Your name, e-mail address, date of birth, and/or phone number. Such information shall be subject to this Privacy Policy unless otherwise stated in the official rules or guidelines of the Promotion or in another privacy policy governing the Promotion. Information we collect in connection with a Promotion will be used to administer the Promotion, such as by notifying winners and distributing prizes. As permitted by applicable law, Your information may also be used by Juno or the Promotion sponsor for marketing purposes. Your entry into the Promotion may result in the addition of Your information to our mailing list as well as to the mailing list of our promotional partners. Acceptance of a prize may require You (unless prohibited by law) to allow Us to post publicly some of Your information via our Services, such as on a winner’s page. In some instances, a third-party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a Promotion on or through our Services, and collect Your information. In those cases, where We are not the sponsor or operator of the Promotion, We have no control over the information collected and, before participating, You should review the official rules as well as the advertiser’s or the sponsor’s privacy policy applicable to the Promotion. All of Our Promotions are intended for people who are the age of majority in their respective state, province or country unless otherwise expressly stated.<br>

We reserve the right to conduct further research and obtain further information as necessary. We will use the information to respond to You and research Your request/communication, all in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.<br>
2. Information We Collect Through Automated Means<br>
When You access the Services, We collect certain information by automated means. This information may include without limitation: (i) technical information about Your computer or Wireless Device, such as Your IP address, device type, operating system type and version, unique device ID, browser, browser language, domain and other systems information, platform types (collectively, “Technical Information”); and (ii) usage statistics about Your interaction with the Services, including Courses accessed, time spent on pages or the Services, pages visited, search queries, click data, portions of the Services used, date and time, and other information regarding Your use of the Services (collectively, “Usage Data”). This Technical Information and Usage Data, which may be linked to Your information, is collected through the use of server log files and tracking technologies, including: (a) cookies, which are small files that websites send to Your computer or Wireless Device to uniquely identify Your browser or mobile device or to store information in Your browser setting; and (b) web beacons, which are small objects that allow Us to measure the actions of visitors using the Services. For more detailed information regarding how We use cookies and other technology, please review the additional information in this Privacy Policy under the Section entitled “Our Cookies Policy”.<br>

<br>
3. Cookies and Data Collection Tools<br>
Like many websites and app providers, Juno (and/or service providers acting on Our behalf, such as Google Analytics and/or our third-party advertisers) may use server log files and automated data collection tools, such as cookies, tags, scripts, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (collectively, “Data Collection Tools”) when You access and use our Services. In some cases, We tie the information gathered by these means to Our other information You provide and that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.

In some cases, We will associate this Technical Information and Usage Data with other information about You.<br>
<br>
We use cookies for a variety of reasons, including to: (i) analyze the usage of our Services; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; (iii) allow You to more easily login to use our Services; and (iv) help make Your use of Our Services more efficient and more valuable by providing You with a customized experience and recognizing You when You return.

<br>
Juno uses the following types of cookies:<br>
<br>
Preferences. We use preferences cookies to remember information about Your browser and how You prefer to use Our Service, i.e. to remember Your preferred settings that affect the experience of how Our Services look to You or behave when You access and/or use them, such as Your preferred language.

We also use session cookies to remember Your log-in details and to be able to process Your purchases of Courses. These are deemed strictly necessary to the working of the Services.

By using Our Services, You consent to Our use of cookies, web beacons, LSOs and other Data Collection Tools as described in this Privacy Policy.

<br>
4. Analytics.<br>
We may use third-party browser and mobile analytics services on our Service, including but not limited to Google Analytics.

The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, and We use this information to improve the Services, to better understand the functionality of the Services on a computer or other device, and to provide information that may be of interest to You. You have some choices concerning our use of these analytics.

<br>
5. Online Advertising<br>
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of advertising about our Services on other websites You visit and other applications You use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page You are visiting, information You enter such as Your age and gender, Your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from You. These ads may be based on Your current activity or Your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to Your interests.<br>
<br>
We use third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to help deliver these tailored advertising on other websites and in mobile applications. These third parties may place cookies or other tracking technologies on Your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about Your use of the Services as discussed above and may access these cookies or other tracking technologies on Your computer, mobile phone, or other device You use to access the Services to serve these tailored advertisements. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of Your email address that is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you, solely in non-human readable form and content that You share publicly when using the services (e.g, user- generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on Your computer, mobile phone, or other device You use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer You a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on Your computer through a web browser.<br>
<br>
When using a mobile application, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, You may still receive advertisements on other websites and mobile applications even if You opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to Your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices You make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.<br>
<br>
To the extent applicable, by opting-in to receive text messages from us or by sending us an initial text message, you agree to receive text messages (a.k.a. SMS messages) from Juno, some of which may be considered marketing and may be delivered by us using autodialer systems/technologies. You also represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the mobile device that you used to subscribe for our mobile communications and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges, as applicable. You (and not Juno) will be responsible for all messaging and data charges that may apply.

What are cookies?<br>
<br>
Cookies are small text files placed onto your computer or device as you browse the Internet. Cookies can be used to collect, store and share bits of information about your activities across websites and services, including on Juno. They also allow us to remember things about your visit to Juno, such as your preferred language and other choices/settings and generally make the site easier for you to use.<br>
<br>
Juno uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to Juno. These cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using Juno. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, such as when you log into Juno. A persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie. We use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period of time. For example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.<br>
<br>
Why does Juno use cookies and similar technologies?<br>
Juno uses cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, browser cookies, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use cookies both when you access our site and services on a browser, as well as through our native mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.<br>

<br>

These technologies help authenticate your access to Juno and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your accounts.<br>
Preferences: To remember information about your browser and your preferences; and to remember your settings and other choices you have made. Cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country that you are in. We can then provide you with content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Juno.<br>
Analytics and research: To help us improve and understand how people use Juno. Cookies help us test different versions of Juno to see which particular features or content users prefer. We may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Juno by using cookies to see how you interact with Juno, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on.<br>
To help us better understand how people use Juno, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics and Mixpanel. These providers use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party Services from which you arrive. The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of Juno. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out plugin by clicking here, and you may also use Mixpanel’s opt out by clicking here.

Advertising: To provide you with more relevant advertising.<br>
As explained further in our Privacy Policy, third-parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via Juno may use cookies to collect information about your activities on the Services, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on. This information may be used by them to serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads. Targeting and advertising cookies we use may include Google Analytics, AdRoll, AppNexus, and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time.  For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit youronlinechoices.eu or allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html .

Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.<br>
<br>
When accessing Juno from a mobile application, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, such as iOS and Android, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in- application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or operating system or contact the applicable platform operator.<br>
