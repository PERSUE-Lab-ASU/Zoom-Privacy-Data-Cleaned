At NOVACRM, we prioritise the security and confidentiality of your personal information.

<h3>Your Role in Ensuring Online Security</h3>
<div>
<h5>1. Account Management Vigilance</h5>
To protect your privacy and secure your account, we strongly recommend logging out of your account after each session, especially if you are using a shared or public computer. This simple step helps prevent unauthorised access to your account and personal data. Additionally, it is important to keep your login credentials private. Sharing your username and password can compromise the security of both your personal and professional information.

 	<li><strong>Data Handling</strong>: Any data accessed through Google Workspace APIs is used solely for the purpose of providing and improving the specific features and services outlined in our platform. No data is shared, used, or repurposed beyond these stated purposes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Compliance with Google’s Data Policies</strong>: We adhere strictly to Google’s API Terms of Service and ensure that all interactions with Google Workspace APIs comply with their guidelines and requirements.</li>
 	<li><strong>No Data Sharing</strong>: Data accessed via Google Workspace APIs is not shared with third parties or used for training external AI/ML models.</li>
 	<li><strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong>: All data processed via Google Workspace APIs is handled securely and in accordance with applicable data privacy laws and regulations.</li>

<h3>Invisible Markers: Optimising Your Experience</h3>
<div>
<h5>1. Decoding Invisible Markers</h5>
Invisible markers, often referred to as web beacons, pixel tags, or clear GIFs, are tiny, transparent images embedded in web pages or emails. These markers gather non-personal data, such as interaction details and general usage patterns. Their primary role is to assist us in analysing the effectiveness of our marketing strategies and understanding broader usage trends.
<h5>2. Analysing Email Interactions</h5>
We incorporate invisible markers in our email communications to gauge how recipients engage with our messages. By tracking metrics like open rates and click-through rates, we can better tailor our content and improve the relevance and impact of our communications.
<h5>3. Personal Data Preferences: Your Control Options</h5>
You have the power to decide how we handle your Personal Information by choosing to “opt in” or “opt out” of certain uses. For example, you can decide if you want to receive our email updates and promotional content. We ensure your Personal Information remains confidential and will not be shared with third parties without your consent.

If you wish to stop receiving marketing emails, click the&nbsp;opt out&nbsp;or&nbsp;“unsubscribe”&nbsp;link provided in those emails. You can also adjust your communication preferences via our Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) Portal at&nbsp;<a href="https://app.novacrm.ca/www.novacrm.ca">www.novacrm.ca</a>. Should you encounter issues with the portal, you can contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@novacrm.ca">privacy@novacrm.ca</a>&nbsp;for support.

Keep in mind that opting out of marketing messages does not affect our ability to contact you regarding important aspects of your account, transactions, or necessary updates. We may still reach out with essential information related to your engagement with our services or as required by law.
<h5>4. Purposeful Use of Your Data</h5>
At NOVACRM, we leverage your Personal Information to deliver and enhance our range of products and services.

We utilise your information to efficiently process and fulfil your requests for products and services. This may involve sharing necessary details with third parties to ensure your requests are completed accurately and promptly.

With your consent, we may send you promotional content about products and services that could interest you. We also engage in ad networks that serve personalised ads based on your online activities. You can opt out of these communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in our emails.

If you provide your phone number, you consent to receiving telemarketing calls and automated messages. You can opt out of these communications at any time. By providing your phone number, you also release us from any liability related to these communications. Note that providing your phone number is not a prerequisite for receiving our services.
<h5>13. Engaging Third-Party Providers</h5>
To deliver and enhance our services, NOVACRM&nbsp;collaborates with various third-party providers. These partners assist us in areas such as website maintenance, product delivery, and customer support. For example, we may share your data with entities that handle web hosting, email communication, credit card processing, and data analytics on our behalf. These providers are bound by agreements to protect your information and only use it as necessary to fulfil their duties.
<h5>14. Necessitated Disclosures</h5>
We may be legally obligated to disclose your information under certain circumstances. This could include complying with legal investigations, responding to court orders, addressing unlawful activities, or safeguarding public safety. Disclosures might also occur if required to adhere to company policies or legal mandates.
<h5>15. Managing Your Data</h5>
You have the right to access, update, or request the deletion of your personal information. To exercise these rights, you can contact us directly or submit a request through our Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) Portal on&nbsp;<a href="https://app.novacrm.ca/www.novacrm.ca">www.novacrm.ca</a>.

<h5>16. Exceptional Circumstances for Data Sharing</h5>
While we do not sell or rent your personal information, there are specific scenarios where data sharing is necessary:
<h5>17. Vendor Partnerships</h5>
We may share information with third-party vendors who assist in delivering services or products. Contracts with these vendors ensure that data is used solely for its intended purpose and protected according to applicable laws.
<h5>18. Business Transactions</h5>
In the event of a business transaction such as a merger or acquisition, we may transfer your data to the new entity, provided that strict confidentiality agreements are in place. If a transaction does not proceed, the data will be returned or destroyed.
<h5>19. Legal Obligations and Safety</h5>
We might disclose information to comply with legal processes or to protect individuals safety. This includes responding to law enforcement requests, handling emergencies, or complying with legal requirements. Disclosure without consent may occur in certain cases where it is necessary to prevent harm or fraud.
<h5>20. Third-Party Links and Services</h5>
