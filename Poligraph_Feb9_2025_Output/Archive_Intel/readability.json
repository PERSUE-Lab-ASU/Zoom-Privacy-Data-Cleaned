ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h4>\n\n<p><strong>1. Purpose: </strong>The purpose of Archive Intel\u2019s AI policy is to ensure legal and ethical use of AI technology. The guidance below defines acceptable and prohibited uses and outlines employee obligations related to the use or development of AI models and applications.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Scope:</strong> This policy applies to All applicable parties \u2013 may include, but not be limited to, employees\u2019, contractors\u2019, directors\u2019 and/or third parties with access to critical or high-risk systems or customer or employee PI use of AI applications or development of internal AI models. This policy applies to the use of those applications on company devices and/or personal devices when used for work purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Key Context:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3.1</strong> AI refers to an artificial intelligence technology that synthesizes new versions of text, audio, or visual imagery from large bodies of data in response to user prompts. AI models can be used in stand-alone applications, or incorporated into other applications such as internet search engines or word processing applications. If you have any questions about what constitutes AI, please contact Ravindra Gupta, Phone 954-240-2521 <a href=\"mailto:ravi@archiveintel.com\">ravi@archiveintel.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>3.2</strong> <strong>Privacy, Security and Confidentiality:</strong> Information is shared with an AI tool by user prompts, or a series of instructions or questions for the tool. Generally, providing access to information constitutes sharing data with the tool. The sharing of data potentially makes confidential or sensitive information public as the tool may train its model on the data shared. In some cases, data that has been anonymized could be linked to personal information and become exposed. Any customer or employee personal information, company proprietary information or intellectual property, or otherwise confidential information entered into the prompt may appear in other users\u2019 output. Therefore, users of AI should avoid entering any information into a AI tool which they do not want to be made public or is otherwise restricted by law or policy.</p>\n<p><strong>3.3</strong> <strong>Verification of AI Output:</strong> Outputs created by AI tools may provide fictitious answers, these are sometimes referred to as hallucinations. Furthermore, many open-source AI models are often trained on large, publicly available datasets (e.g., through data extraction of public webpages). The outputs may therefore contain copyrighted information, or others\u2019 intellectual property. While ownership in many of these cases is unclear, users should err on the side of caution and not use any output that contains material they suspect to be under copyright protection in any materials, internal or externally facing.</p>\n<p>Users of AI tools must also be aware that they incorporate any biases of the data sets that were used to train them. This modeling bias may not always align with (Company\u2019s) core value of Innovation, Integrity, Customer-Centricity, Reliability, Compliance, Collaboration, Accessibility and Transparency (https://archiveintel.com/about-us/) and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Therefore, model output may make systematic errors or favor certain groups, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Users of AI must adhere to existing review processes where AI is used to make decisions or provide analysis of information that may be subject to bias.</p>\n<p>Using output from AI tools without reviewing it for accuracy places the company at risk and may harm Archive Intel\u2019s reputation with customers and employees.</p>\n<p><strong>3.4 Transparency:</strong> Consistent with our code of conduct and other policy, we aim to provide our employees, third parties, and customers with transparency regarding how we use AI to support our work. All content generated using AI must be clearly identified on any outward-facing content.</p>\n<p><strong>3.5 Third-party risk:</strong> Data sent by Archive Intel to third parties could be used in the third party\u2019s use of AI tools. Uses include, but are not limited to, training new AI models, providing updated information for existing AI models, and improving the user experience. Sensitive information input into unapproved AI applications may appear as output for individuals outside of the company. Not using AI in accordance with this policy may violate Archive Intel\u2019s contractual obligations with customers or vendors or, in some cases, violate applicable law.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Acceptable Use:</strong> Any use of AI, via platforms, tools, and software must be consistent with our code of conduct, company policy, and applicable law. Use of AI on company devices must be limited to business purposes. Use of AI tools personal devices or personal accounts to conduct company business is prohibited. Use of AI tools on personal devices to circumvent company policies or safeguards is strictly prohibited.</p>\n<p>Any violation of this policy or use cases out of scope of the table below, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>\n<p>This table is not inclusive of all possible use cases and if a use case is not specifically listed, a user should ask before proceeding. We reserve the right to make changes to, or update this table periodically:</p>\n<p><strong>5. Policy Guidelines</strong></p>\n<p>For any use of AI applications, employees must adhere to the following:</p>\n<p><strong>5.1</strong> To maintain the security of our data and IT systems, employees are prohibited from attempting to gain access to unapproved AI applications when using company systems or networks, conducting business on behalf of the company, or when using the company\u2019s data.

To protect the company:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do clearly attribute any output used for work purposes to the AI application that created it through a footnote or other means visible to the reader.</li>\n<li>Do maintain an updated record AI use for work purposes and be able to share those records with your manager or other authorized company personnel upon request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.4</strong> To protect our employees and clients from harm, and to protect the company from reputational damage, employees must use AI pursuant to Archive Intel\u2019s business code of conduct and non-discrimination policies. AI -created content that is inappropriate, discriminatory or otherwise harmful to our employees or clients/customers must not be used for work purposes. Such use will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>\n<p>To protect our employees, customers, and the company:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do review output of AI applications to make sure it meets Company\u2019s standards for principles of equity, ethics, and appropriateness.</li>\n<li>Do not use any output that discriminates against individuals based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, political affiliation or sexual orientation.</li>\n<li>Do not use AI applications to create text, audio, or visual content for purposes of committing fraud or to misrepresent an individual\u2019s identity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.5</strong> All employees and contractors are expected to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or company policies regarding the use or development of AI content or tools.</p>\n<p><strong>5.6</strong> All employees are expected to report instances of non-compliance with this policy to the compliance team at ravi@archiveintel.com or call this number 954-240-2521 Employees are encouraged to speak up when they witness misconduct. Employees who report misconduct or concerns in good faith will not be retaliated against.</p></div><div id=\"16\"><h4>16. iMessage and WhatsApp Data Protection</h4>\n<p>We take your privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring that your data is handled securely.

Purpose: The purpose of Archive Intel\u2019s AI policy is to ensure legal and ethical use of AI technology. The guidance below defines acceptable and prohibited uses and outlines employee obligations related to the use or development of AI models and applications.\n2. Scope: This policy applies to All applicable parties \u2013 may include, but not be limited to, employees\u2019, contractors\u2019, directors\u2019 and/or third parties with access to critical or high-risk systems or customer or employee PI use of AI applications or development of internal AI models. This policy applies to the use of those applications on company devices and/or personal devices when used for work purposes.\n3. Key Context:\u00a0\n3.1 AI refers to an artificial intelligence technology that synthesizes new versions of text, audio, or visual imagery from large bodies of data in response to user prompts. AI models can be used in stand-alone applications, or incorporated into other applications such as internet search engines or word processing applications. If you have any questions about what constitutes AI, please contact Ravindra Gupta, Phone 954-240-2521 ravi@archiveintel.com\n3.2 Privacy, Security and Confidentiality: Information is shared with an AI tool by user prompts, or a series of instructions or questions for the tool. Generally, providing access to information constitutes sharing data with the tool. The sharing of data potentially makes confidential or sensitive information public as the tool may train its model on the data shared. In some cases, data that has been anonymized could be linked to personal information and become exposed. Any customer or employee personal information, company proprietary information or intellectual property, or otherwise confidential information entered into the prompt may appear in other users\u2019 output. Therefore, users of AI should avoid entering any information into a AI tool which they do not want to be made public or is otherwise restricted by law or policy.\n3.3 Verification of AI Output: Outputs created by AI tools may provide fictitious answers, these are sometimes referred to as hallucinations. Furthermore, many open-source AI models are often trained on large, publicly available datasets (e.g., through data extraction of public webpages). The outputs may therefore contain copyrighted information, or others\u2019 intellectual property. While ownership in many of these cases is unclear, users should err on the side of caution and not use any output that contains material they suspect to be under copyright protection in any materials, internal or externally facing.\nUsers of AI tools must also be aware that they incorporate any biases of the data sets that were used to train them. This modeling bias may not always align with (Company\u2019s) core value of Innovation, Integrity, Customer-Centricity, Reliability, Compliance, Collaboration, Accessibility and Transparency (https://archiveintel.com/about-us/) and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Therefore, model output may make systematic errors or favor certain groups, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Users of AI must adhere to existing review processes where AI is used to make decisions or provide analysis of information that may be subject to bias.\nUsing output from AI tools without reviewing it for accuracy places the company at risk and may harm Archive Intel\u2019s reputation with customers and employees.\n3.4 Transparency: Consistent with our code of conduct and other policy, we aim to provide our employees, third parties, and customers with transparency regarding how we use AI to support our work. All content generated using AI must be clearly identified on any outward-facing content.\n3.5 Third-party risk: Data sent by Archive Intel to third parties could be used in the third party\u2019s use of AI tools. Uses include, but are not limited to, training new AI models, providing updated information for existing AI models, and improving the user experience. Sensitive information input into unapproved AI applications may appear as output for individuals outside of the company. Not using AI in accordance with this policy may violate Archive Intel\u2019s contractual obligations with customers or vendors or, in some cases, violate applicable law.\n4. Acceptable Use: Any use of AI, via platforms, tools, and software must be consistent with our code of conduct, company policy, and applicable law. Use of AI on company devices must be limited to business purposes. Use of AI tools personal devices or personal accounts to conduct company business is prohibited. Use of AI tools on personal devices to circumvent company policies or safeguards is strictly prohibited.\nAny violation of this policy or use cases out of scope of the table below, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\nThis table is not inclusive of all possible use cases and if a use case is not specifically listed, a user should ask before proceeding. We reserve the right to make changes to, or update this table periodically:\n5. Policy Guidelines\nFor any use of AI applications, employees must adhere to the following:\n5.1 To maintain the security of our data and IT systems, employees are prohibited from attempting to gain access to unapproved AI applications when using company systems or networks, conducting business on behalf of the company, or when using the company\u2019s data. To avoid potential data leaks or security incidents:\n\nDo not use company credentials, email addresses, or telephone numbers as a login to publicly available AI applications.\nDo not install non-approved Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), plug-ins, connectors, or software related to AI systems.\nDo not implement or use in any way code generated by AI on company systems.\n\n5.2 To maintain the confidentiality of our company\u2019s sensitive information, including but not limited to employee and customer personal information, our intellectual property, and copyrighted material, employees and contractors must only share information with approved personal and only input sensitive information into approved AI systems. To maintain confidentiality:\n\nDo not input company intellectual property into non-approved AI applications.\nDo not enter personal information (PII) of employees, customers, or other third parties into any non-approved AI application. Treat the application as you would an employee of another company with whom we have no formal relationship.\nDo contact your manager, or email {Legal office contact information} if you are unsure whether information you are planning to input falls into any of the above categories.\nDo review the company\u2019s data handling policies by clicking here {Link to policies}.\n\n5.3 To maintain transparency with customers and employees and protect the company from claims against copyright infringement and/or theft of intellectual property, all AI generated content must be cited and reviewed if used for work purposes. To protect the company:\n\nDo clearly attribute any output used for work purposes to the AI application that created it through a footnote or other means visible to the reader.\nDo maintain an updated record AI use for work purposes and be able to share those records with your manager or other authorized company personnel upon request.\n\n5.4 To protect our employees and clients from harm, and to protect the company from reputational damage, employees must use AI pursuant to Archive Intel\u2019s business code of conduct and non-discrimination policies. AI -created content that is inappropriate, discriminatory or otherwise harmful to our employees or clients/customers must not be used for work purposes. Such use will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\nTo protect our employees, customers, and the company:\n\nDo review output of AI applications to make sure it meets Company\u2019s standards for principles of equity, ethics, and appropriateness.\nDo not use any output that discriminates against individuals based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, political affiliation or sexual orientation.\nDo not use AI applications to create text, audio, or visual content for purposes of committing fraud or to misrepresent an individual\u2019s identity.\n\n5.5 All employees and contractors are expected to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or company policies regarding the use or development of AI content or tools.\n5.6 All employees are expected to report instances of non-compliance with this policy to the compliance team at ravi@archiveintel.com or call this number 954-240-2521 Employees are encouraged to speak up when they witness misconduct. Employees who report misconduct or concerns in good faith will not be retaliated against.16. iMessage and WhatsApp Data Protection\nWe take your privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring that your data is handled securely.
