We do not exercise control over third party\n        services or other websites that provide information, or links from within the Site or the\n        Services. Your interactions with these third party services are governed by the privacy\n        policy of the company providing it. These other sites and services may place their own\n        cookies or other files on your computer\u2019s browser, collect data or solicit Personal\n        Information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use\n        or disclosure of the Personal Information that you submit, and the collection and use of\n        such information and access of any third party websites are subject to such third\n        party\u2019s privacy policy. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and other terms\n        of such third parties before using their services.</p> <li><strong>Security</strong></li> <p>We understand the importance of privacy and security of Personal Information to our users\n        and have made them a priority. Sesh uses security technologies and procedures to help\n        protect Personal Information about you from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.\n        However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome\n        those measures or use your Personal Information for improper purposes, and we do not promise\n        that Personal Information about you or private communications will be protected from\n        unauthorized disclosure or use.</p> <li><strong>Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</strong></li> <p>Sesh does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide\n        targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However,\n        some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you\n        content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.</p> <li><strong>Managing Your Privacy</strong></li> <p>We keep your data on your behalf and for your benefit.

We encourage you to first reach out to us at\n        <a href=\"mailto:support@sesh.com\">support@sesh.com</a>, so we have an\n        opportunity to address your concerns directly before you do so.</p> <li><strong>California Residents</strong></li> <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires certain businesses that share customer\n        Personal Information with third parties for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing\n        purposes to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses\u2019\n        practices related to such information-sharing. We currently do not share or disclose your\n        Personal Information to third parties for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing\n        purposes. If we change our practices in the future, we will implement an opt-out policy as\n        required under California laws.</p> <p>Furthermore, subject to certain exemptions, California residents have the following rights\n        with respect to Personal Information we may have collected about them:</p> <p><strong><em>Requests to Know</em></strong></p> <p>You have the right to request that we disclose:</p> <ul><li>The categories of Personal Information we have collected about you;</li> <li>The categories of Personal Information about you we have sold or disclosed for a business\n          purpose;</li> <li>The categories of sources from which we have collected Personal Information about you;</li> <li>The business or commercial purposes for selling or collecting Personal Information about\n          you;</li> <li>The categories of Personal Information sold or shared, if any, about you, as well as the\n          categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold, by category of\n          Personal Information for each party to whom Personal Information was sold; and</li> <li>The specific pieces of Personal Information collected.</li></ul> <p>You may submit a request to know via\n        <a href=\"https://sesh.com/request-information\">https://sesh.com/request-information </a>. The delivery of\n        our response may take place electronically or by mail. We are not required to respond to\n        requests to know more than twice in a 12-month period. We do not sell, and have not in the\n        prior 12 months sold, Personal Information about California residents. Therefore, we have\n        not included a \"Do Not Sell My Personal Info\" link on our Site. If our practices change, we\n        will update this Privacy Policy and take any other necessary action to comply with\n        applicable law. We do, however, disclose Personal Information for business purposes as\n        described in the \"Third Parties We Share Personal Information With\" section above.</p> <p><strong><em>Requests to Delete</em></strong></p> <p>You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information about you that we have\n        collected.

You must provide an\n        authorized agent written permission to submit a request on your behalf, and we may require\n        that you verify your identity directly with us. Alternatively, an authorized agent that has\n        been provided power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000-4465 may submit a\n        request on your behalf.</p> <p><strong><em>Methods for Submitting Consumer Requests and Our Response to Requests</em></strong></p> <p>You may submit a request for access and requests to delete Personal Information about you\n        via:</p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://sesh.com/request-information\">https://sesh.com/request-information </a>,</li> <li><a href=\"https://sesh.com/request-delete\">https://sesh.com/request-delete </a>, or</li> <li>via email at\n          <a href=\"mailto:support@sesh.com\">support@sesh.com</a></li></ul> <p>Upon receipt of a request, we may ask you for additional information to verify your\n        identity.

The response we provide will also explain the reasons we\n        cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</p> <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it\n        is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants\n        a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate\n        before completing your request.</p> <p><strong><em>The Right to Non-Discrimination</em></strong></p> <p>You have the right not to be discriminated against for the exercise of your California\n        privacy rights described above.

In addition, we\n        may work with third-party service providers in the U.S. and in other countries to support\n        our business activities. Thus, Personal Information may be transferred to, stored on servers\n        in, and accessed from the United States and countries other than the country in which the\n        Personal Information was initially collected. In all such instances, we use, transfer, and\n        disclose Personal Information solely for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice and\n        in compliance with applicable laws.</p> <li><strong>Data Retention</strong></li> <p>We keep Personal Information related to your Account for as long as it is needed to fulfill\n        the purposes for which it was collected, to provide our services, to deal with possible\n        legal claims, to comply with our business interests and/or to abide by all applicable laws.\n        Thereafter, we either delete Personal Information about you or de-identify it. Please note\n        that even if you request the deletion of Personal Information about you, we may be required\n        (by law or otherwise) to retain the Personal Information and not delete it. However, once\n        those requirements are removed, we will delete Personal Information about you in accordance\n        with your request.</p> <li><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></li> <p>Our security and Privacy Policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary.
