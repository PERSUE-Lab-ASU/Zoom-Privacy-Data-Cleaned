                Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council. DPA defines the

                Namely, we and Facebook act as joint controllers with regard to marketing and statistical data 
                collected by Facebook and shared with us via Facebook pixel.

                may exercise his/her rights under the GDPR in respect of and against both Facebook/our users and us.
