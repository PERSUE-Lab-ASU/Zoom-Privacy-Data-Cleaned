<h2><strong>Effective Date; Changes.</strong> This Policy applies to all information collected by or provided to us in connection with the Services.

</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Collected Information.</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Account Data.</strong> When you log-in to or create an account with the Services, we collect the information you provide in the applicable form. This information includes personally identifiable information such as your name, email, phone number and password. When we refer to “personally identifiable information” in this Policy, we mean information that we can directly associate with a specific person or entity without additional information. To the extent you decline to share certain personally identifiable information with us, we may not be able to provide some or all of the features and functionalities found on the Services.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong>. When you use the Services, we automatically gather certain non-personally identifiable information from you. This includes usage information, such as information on the beginning and ending timestamps of each communication session, how far Products were “driven” during each session, which remote users were involved in each session and the timestamps of when Products are turned on/off and docked/undocked. This also may include server log data such as the IP address, browser type, or device ID of your computer or mobile device, or (in the case of the Site) the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Site. As described below, we collect this information through a number of means, including server logs, cookies and other online tracking mechanisms. We may use this information to improve quality, features and performance. We may provide this information back to users in the form of reports and statistics. We may associate such non-personally identifiable information with the personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with the Services. But if we do so, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Online Tracking and Cookies.</strong> The Services may use web beacons, cookies and other online tracking mechanisms to collect information. “Beacons” (also often referred to as “pixels”) are tiny graphics on a web page designed to track when a page is viewed. Beacons also can be inserted into emails in order to track certain information, including whether an email has been opened. “Cookies” are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters that are downloaded by your web browser or mobile device when you visit a website. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies when you access and use the Services. Cookies may be used, for example, to remember your user account information and your preferences, to customize the interface of the Services for you and to assist us in measuring and analyzing Services traffic. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Services. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your browser’s documentation to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings. You can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your computer’s hard drive and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored. We partner with certain third parties to collect non-personally identifiable information. These third parties may use web logs, web beacons or other online tracking mechanisms, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. Means of opting out of this third-party data collection are discussed below in Section 2(4).</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Analytics.</strong> We use certain third party services to assist us in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting regarding the Services. These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, we use Google Analytics to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed in this Policy. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics on the Site at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</h3>
</li>
<li>
