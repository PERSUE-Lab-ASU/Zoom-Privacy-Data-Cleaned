Please note that you will not be able to successfully use our Services without connecting your Google or Microsoft calendar to our Services.\n\n    \n    \n        Marketing.\n        We do not sell, or share your personal information with non affiliated companies for their own direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission. We do not sell Meeting Content Information or information about your meeting attendees to anyone.\n\n    \n    \n        Third Party Advertising.\n        We work with third party advertisers to show you ads for Fathom\u2019s Services. Some of our third party advertisers are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (https://optout.networkadvertising.org) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (https://optout.aboutads.info). If you do not wish to receive such ads, please visit their opt-out pages to learn about how you may opt out of receiving web-based ads from member companies. You can access any settings offered by your mobile operating system to limit ad tracking, or you can install the AppChoices mobile app to learn more about how you may opt out of ads in mobile apps. Information received by these parties includes Device Information. For the avoidance of doubt,  information received by these third parties does not include your Meeting Content Information, Registration Information, or your Fathom account information.\n\n    \n    \n        As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.\n        We may access, preserve, and disclose your personal information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or other legal process; (b) respond to your requests; (c) detect and investigate security incidents and potentially illegal or prohibited activities; or (d) protect your, our, or others\u2019 rights, property, or safety. For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the Services.\n\n    \n    \n        Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.\n        We may transfer your personal information to advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets or stock. The use of your personal information following any of these events will be governed by the provisions of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time the applicable information was collected.\n\n    \n    \n        Consent.\n        We may also disclose your personal information with your permission.\n\n    \n\n\n  Data Retention\n\n  \n    \n        We store all personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, or for as long as we are required to do so by law or in order to comply with a regulatory obligation. When deleting personal information, we will take measures to render such personal information irrecoverable or irreproducible, and the electronic files which contain personal information will be permanently deleted.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  Delete your Account or Pose a Question\n\n  \n    \n        You can delete your Fathom account at any time from your account settings. If you no longer use our Services, your account and the personal information in it will remain unless you actively delete the account from your account settings. If we receive an account deletion request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your recordings and personal information within 30 days of your account deletion request, although we cannot guarantee that deletion will always occur within this timeframe.  However, if we are legally required to retain that information under applicable laws, we will retain your personal information, subject to the \u201cData Retention\u201d Section above, but we will take measures to pseudonymize it.\n\n    \n    \n        If you deauthorize Fathom through your Google or Outlook account settings, your Fathom account will be disabled until you reconnect either an Outlook Calendar or Google Calendar account. As noted above, linking an Outlook Calendar or a Google Calendar account is core to our Services and without a linked Outlook Calendar or a Google Calendar, you will not be able to successfully use our Services.\n\n    \n    \n        Please note that, if you use our Services through a business account of one of our customers, for example your employer or another business or organization, their privacy policies will apply to the processing and deletion of your information. We will not be able to delete the personal information on the business account on your request. If you have questions about your privacy on the Services or this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@fathom.video.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n  Third Parties\n\n  \n    \n        Our Services may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do not own or operate.

However, as no electronic transmission or storage of information can be entirely secure, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  Children's Privacy\n\n  \n    \n        We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under the age of 18, and no part of our Services is targeted or directed to children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we may delete such information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children\u2019s internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on our website and/or our Services without their permission. If you learn that a child under the age of 18 has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may alert us at privacy@fathom.video. We will take reasonable steps to delete that information as quickly as possible.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  Cookies\n\n  \n    \n        For more information on the types of cookies Fathom uses and the choices that you have to manage your cookie preferences, please visit our Cookie Policy.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  Your Rights and Choices\n\n  \n    \n        Marketing Communications.\n        You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails via the link provided in the emails.

This can include the categories and sources of personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal information with, if any.\n\n          You may have the right to data portability.\n\n          You may have the right to opt out of the selling of your personal information to a third party.\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        To exercise these rights with respect to your personal information, you must provide us with sufficient information to verify your identity. Alternatively, you may also authorize an agent to exercise your rights on your behalf (\u201cAuthorized Agent\u201d). To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable Consumer request within the timeframes set forth in the CCPA.\n\n    \n    \n        We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.\n\n    \n    \n        Fathom Does Not Sell or Share Your Personal Information in California.\n        Fathom does not sell or share your personal information with third parties.

You may request access to and receive information about the personal information we maintain about you, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual\u2019s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.\n\n          Rectification. If you believe that any personal information that we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you may request us to update, correct or delete the inaccuracies in your personal information.\n\n          Restriction of Processing or Objection.

You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us regarding the processing of your personal information, at any time, and free of charge. We will apply your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you withdrew your consent.\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        Please note that, prior to any response to the exercise of such rights, we will require you to verify your identity. In addition, we may have valid legal reasons to refuse your request and will inform you if that is the case.

Generally, we will provide you with access to the information unless applicable laws allow us to refuse, or prevent us from giving you, access to the personal information we hold about you.  We will never unreasonably refuse requests to access personal information.\n\n    \n    \n        Where we agree to provide you with access to your personal information, sometimes we may make this conditional on us recovering our reasonable costs of doing so.  No fee will be incurred for requesting access, but if your request for access is accepted, you will be notified of the fee payable (if any) for providing access if you choose to proceed with your access request.\n\n    \n    \n        You may also lodge a request to correct personal information we hold about you if you believe it is inaccurate, incomplete, irrelevant, misleading or out of date.

This information may be disclosed to our related bodies corporate and service providers for purposes such as aptitude and psychological testing or other human resources management activities.\n\n    \n    \n        As part of the application process, you may be asked for your consent to the use and disclosure of certain personal information about pre-employment testing.  We may also ask you to consent to the disclosure of your personal information to those people who you nominated to provide references.  A refusal to provide any of this information, or to consent to its proposed disclosure, may affect the success of the application.\n\n    \n    \n          This policy does not apply to our handling of information about our employees.  Our handling of employee records is exempt from the Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the \"Australian Privacy Act\") if the act or practice is directly related to:\n    \n          either a current or former employment relationship between us and the individual; and\n\n          an employee record held by us relating to the individual.\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        For information about our practices relating to employee records, please contact us at privacy@fathom.video.\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        Notifiable Data Breaches\n          \n        A notifiable data breach scheme is currently in place in Australia.  We are committed to adhering to this scheme as an important step in preventing and managing serious privacy breaches. A \"data breach\" means unauthorised access to, or disclosure, alteration, loss, or destruction of, personal information \u2014or, an action that prevents us from accessing personal information on either a temporary or permanent basis.  An \"eligible data breach\", in accordance with the Australian Privacy Act, occurs when there is a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm to any of the individuals to whom the information relates and we are unable to prevent the likely risk of serious harm with remedial action.\n\n    \n    \n          We, including all our people, take breaches of privacy very seriously.  If we suspect a privacy breach has occurred, our priority is to contain and assess the suspected breach.  In doing so, we will:\n    \n          take any necessary immediate action to contain the breach and reduce the risk of harm;\n\n          determine the cause and extent of the breach;\n\n          consider the types of information involved, including whether the personal information is sensitive in nature;\n\n          analyse the nature of the harm that may be caused to affected individuals;\n\n          consider the person or body that has obtained or may obtain personal information as a result of the breach (if known); and\n\n          determine whether the personal information is protected by a security measure.\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        If we believe an eligible data breach has occurred we will, as soon as practicable, notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and all affected individuals or, if it is not possible to notify affected individuals, provide public notice of the breach (in a manner that protects the identity of affected individuals).\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n  Changes to this Privacy Policy\n\n  \n    \n        We will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this page, and the revised version will be effective when it is posted. If we materially change the ways in which we use or disclose personal information previously collected from you through the Services, we may notify you through the Services, by email, or other communication. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  Contact Information\n\n  \n    \n        If you have any questions, comments, complaints or concerns about this Privacy Policy, our privacy practices, or if you would like to exercise your rights with respect to your personal information, please email us at privacy@fathom.video or write to us at Fathom Video Inc., 2261 Market Street #4156, San Francisco, CA 94114.
