Cookies are text files that are stored in the internet browser or by the internet browser\n                    on the user's computer system. When a user calls up a website, a cookie may be stored on the user's operating system.\n                    This cookie contains a characteristic string of symbols that enables the browser to be uniquely identified when the\n                    website is called up again.</p> <p>Our legitimate interest in the use of cookies pursuant to Art 6 (1) f) GDPR is to make our website more\n                    user-friendly, effective and secure.</p> <p>Since cookies are stored directly on your computer, you as a user also have full control over the use of cookies. By\n                    changing the settings in your internet browser, you can deactivate or limit the transmission of cookies. Cookies that\n                    have already been stored can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically.
