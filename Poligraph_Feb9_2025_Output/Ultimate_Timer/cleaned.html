                    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27.04.2016 (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR).</p> <p>The operator of this site guarantees that, in accordance with the law, personal data will be processed in compliance

Extent and legal basis of the processing of personal data</h3> <p><b>We may store:</b></p> <ul><li>- Your email address, unique user ID and language preferences</li> <li>- Data you knowingly and actively enter into our applications (Timer data)</li> <li>- Automated server logs (IP Address, browser type, Referrer URL, Date and time of access and similar)</li></ul> <b>We DO NOT access, process or store meeting, video or call data in any form.</b><br> <br> <p>Data will not be passed on to third parties.</p> <p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 GDPR and, if necessary, specific contractual agreements
                    with the user and associated obligations.</p> <h3>3. Data deletion and storage period</h3> <p>We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. In certain circumstances, we may be required by law to retain your personal information, or may need to retain your personal information in order to continue providing a service.</p> <p>In some cases, the law prescribes the retention of personal data. In these cases, we only store the data for these
                      legal purposes, but do not process it elsewhere and delete it after the legal retention period has expired.</p> <h3>4. What data we use and why</h3> <h4>Cookies</h4> <p>Our website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in the internet browser or by the internet browser
                    on the user's computer system. When a user calls up a website, a cookie may be stored on the user's operating system.
                    This cookie contains a characteristic string of symbols that enables the browser to be uniquely identified when the
                    website is called up again.</p> <p>Our legitimate interest in the use of cookies pursuant to Art 6 (1) f) GDPR is to make our website more
                    user-friendly, effective and secure.</p> <p>Since cookies are stored directly on your computer, you as a user also have full control over the use of cookies. By
                    changing the settings in your internet browser, you can deactivate or limit the transmission of cookies. Cookies that
                    have already been stored can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated
                    for our website, it may no longer be possible to use all the functions of the website to their full extent.</p> <h4>Sign-In Data</h4> <p>If you access our applications through the Zoom client or use the Zoom sign-in, we will store your email address, Zoom user ID and language preferences. We will use this data to create an account for you in our system. The data will not be passed on to third parties.</p> <p>We may use your email address to contact you for non-marketing purposes.</p> <p>The legal basis for the processing of this data is your express consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 a) GDPR
                    and, if applicable, Art. 6 Para. 1 b) GDPR if mutual contractual obligations still exist.</p> <h4>Contact form &amp;  e-mail contact</h4> <p>If you submit inquiries to us via our contact or feedback form, the information provided in the form as well as any contact information provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry and in the event that we have further questions. We will not share this information without your consent.</p> <p>As an alternative, it is possible to contact us via the e-mail address provided. In this case, the user's personal
                    data transmitted with the e-mail will be stored. The legal basis for the processing of the data is therefore your
                    explicit consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 a) and b) GDPR.</p> <p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6  (1) lit. (b) GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6 (1) lit. (f) GDPR) or on your agreement (Art. 6 (1) lit. (a) GDPR) if this has been requested.</p> <p>The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is being archived no longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded our response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions, in particular retention periods.</p> <h4>Information Collected Automatically</h4> <p>Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer. The type and amount of data transmitted and processed depend on the Internet browser you are using and its configuration and typically includes:

    the accessed website,

    source/reference from where you got to the page,

    the browser used,

    the operating system used,

    the IP address used and

    the language you prefer.</p> <p>This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user. The storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the provision of the website to the user’s computer. The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, we use the data to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p> <h3>Third-Party services and Sub-processors</h3> <h4>Google Cloud Platform</h4> <p>We host our website and applications on the Google cloud platform. 
                    For this purpose, the browser you are using must connect to Google's servers. This informs Google that our website has been accessed via your IP address.  <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=it" target="_blank">Google Privacy</a>.</p> <p>The use of Google Cloud is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, under which we have a legitimate interest in ensuring the most reliable and secure representation of our website. If specific consent has been obtained for any data processing activities, such processing is carried out exclusively based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR, and such consent may be revoked at any time.</p> <h4>Google Web Fonts</h4> <p>This site uses so-called web fonts provided by Google for the uniform display of fonts. When you open a page, your
                    browser loads the required web fonts into its browser cache in order to display texts and fonts correctly.</p> <p>For this purpose, the browser you are using must connect to Google's servers. This informs Google that our website
                    has been accessed via your IP address. Google Web Fonts are used in the interest of a consistent and appealing
                    presentation of our online offers. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR.</p> <p>You can find more information about Google Web Fonts at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank">Google Fonts FAQ</a> and in Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=it" target="_blank">Google Privacy</a>.</p> <h4>Cloudflare DNS</h4> <p>We use Cloudflare as a DNS server and load balancer. For this purpose, the browser you are using must connect to Cloudflare's servers. This informs Cloudflare that our website has been accessed via your IP address.  <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Privacy Policy of Cloudflare</a></p> <p>The use of Cloudflare is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, under which we have a legitimate interest in ensuring the most reliable and secure representation of our website. If specific consent has been obtained for any data processing activities, such processing is carried out exclusively based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR, and such consent may be revoked at any time.</p> <h3>6. Your rights as a person affected by data processing</h3> <p>If your personal data is processed, you are a person concerned within the meaning of the GDPR and you have the
                    following rights towards the responsible person:</p> <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;"><li>the right to confirmation and information</li> <li>the right to rectification</li> <li>the right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")</li> <li>the right to restriction of processing</li> <li>the right to be informed</li> <li>the right to data transferability</li> <li>the right to object</li> <li>the right to revoke the declaration of consent under data protection law</li> <li>the right not to be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling</li> <li>the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.</li></ol> <h3>7. Data security</h3> <p>We are very concerned about the security of your data within the framework of the applicable data protection laws and
                    technical possibilities.</p> <p>Your personal data is always transmitted in encrypted form. This applies in particular to your orders and also to the
                    customer login. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes
                    from http:// to https:// and by the lock symbol in your browser line. We use the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) coding
                    system, but we would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can
                    have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p> <p>To protect your data, we maintain technical and organisational security measures in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR,
                    which we continuously adapt to the state of the art.</p> <p>We also do not guarantee that our service will be available at certain times; disruptions, interruptions or failures
                    cannot be excluded. The servers we use are carefully backed up on a regular basis.</p> <h3>8. Disclosure of data to third parties</h3> <p>Generally, we only use your personal data within our company. However, we cannot exclude that when data is
                    transferred to third parties, it may be transferred to another EU or non-EU country or to an international
                    organisation, provided that this is in accordance with the purpose of the data processing.</p> <p>If and to the extent that we involve third parties in the performance of contracts (such as logistics service
                    providers), they will only receive personal data to the extent that the transfer is necessary for the relevant
                    service.</p> <p>In the event that we outsource certain parts of data processing (commissioned processing), we contractually oblige
                    commissioned processors to use personal data only in accordance with the requirements of data protection laws and to
                    ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.</p> <h4>9.
