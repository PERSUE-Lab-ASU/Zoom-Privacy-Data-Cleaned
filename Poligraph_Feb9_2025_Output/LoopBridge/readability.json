COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS\n\n\n\n9.1 SCOPE\n\n\n\nExcept as otherwise provided, this Section 9 applies only if you are a California resident. For purposes of this section, \u201cPersonal Information\u201d has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201c), the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201c), and any regulations promulgated under either law, in each case, as amended from time to time.\n\n\n\nThis Section 9 does not apply to;\n\n\n\n\ninformation exempted from the scope of the CCPA;\n\n\n\nactivities governed by a different privacy notice, such as notices we give to California personnel or job candidates; or\n\n\n\nPersonal Information we collect, use, and share on behalf of our customers as a \u201cservice provider\u201d under the CCPA.\n\n\n\n\n9.2 YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS\n\n\n\nYou have the following rights:\n\n\n\n\nRight to Information/Know\u00a0You can request whether we have collected your Personal Information, and in certain cases, the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe categories of Personal Information we have collected.\n\n\n\nThe categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information.\n\n\n\nThe business or commercial purpose for collecting, sharing, and/or selling Personal Information.\n\n\n\nThe categories of Personal Information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose.\n\n\n\nThe categories of third parties to whom Personal Information was sold, shared, or disclosed for a business purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nRight to Access.

You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.\n\n\n\nRight to Opt-Out of Tracking for Targeted Advertising Purposes. While we do not sell Personal Information for money, like many companies, we use services that help deliver targeted ads (also known as interest-based ads) to you, as we have described in the \u201cHow and Why We Use Your Personal Data\u201d section above. The CCPA classifies our use of some of these services as \u201csharing\u201d your Personal Information with the advertising partners that provide the services, from which you have the right to opt-out.\n\n\n\nRight to Nondiscrimination. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination prohibited by the CCPA.\n\n\n\n\nVerification of Identity. We will need to verify your identity to process your information/know, access, correction, and deletion requests and reserve the right to confirm your California residency. To verify your identity, we may require you to log into an Loop Bridge online account (if applicable), provide government identification, give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information. These rights are not absolute, and in some instances, we may decline your request as permitted by law.\n\n\n\nAuthorized Agents. Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent\u2019s identity and our receipt of a copy of the valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity and provide us with written confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.\n\n\n\n9.3 PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE\n\n\n\nThe table below describes our Personal Information practices by reference to the categories in the \u201cPersonal Data Collected by Loop Bridge\u201d section above and the categories described in the CCPA (Cal.
