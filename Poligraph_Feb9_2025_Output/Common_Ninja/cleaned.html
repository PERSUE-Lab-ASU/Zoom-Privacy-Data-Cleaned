Data Controller/Processor</h3><p><span style="font-weight:400">Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR, UK GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the “Data Controller” (or under the CCPA, “business”), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “Data processor” (or under the CCPA, “service provider”), who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller (or business, if the CCPA applies). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.</span></p><p><strong>Common Ninja is the “Data Controller” of its User, Prospect and Customer Data</strong><span style="font-weight:400">. With respect to these categories of personal data, we assume the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. When we process personal data as a Data Controller, our Service Providers processing such data on our behalf will assume the role of “Data processor”, in accordance with the instructions given to them by us and in accordance with the data processing agreement we have with them.</span></p><p><strong>Common Ninja is the “Data Processor” of End-User Information</strong><span style="font-weight:400">. We receive such End-User Information through our Common Ninja API or through other features, applications or widgets of our Platform used by our Users to share with us End-User Data.
