<li>Concierge Services</li>
</ol>
<p>Fitli provides Concierge Services to user for the purpose of assisting user in securing bookings at Out-of-Network Service Providers. Out-of-Network Service Providers are businesses that have not signed up to be part of the Fitli network and have no contractual relationship or affiliation with Fitli in any way. Fitli performs this service for free and provides no guarantees, liabilities, or warranty in relation to the service. Fitli will make a best effort to secure a requested booking with an Out-of-Network Service Provider and confirm that booking with User. All purchases, payments, cancellations, refunds or any other activities associated with a requested booking must be handled directly between User and that Out-of-Network Service Provider.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>Purchasing Sessions, Packages, or Memberships</li>
</ol>
<p>Purchasing</p>
<p>Users can purchase sessions, packages, or memberships from In-Network Service Providers. In-Network Service Providers are businesses that have signed up to be a part of the Fitli network and have a contractual relationship and affiliation with fitli. In order to book a session with an In-Network Service Provider, User must first purchase a session, package, or membership from that Service Provider. That purchase transaction is, exclusively, between the User and In-Network Service Provider. Fitli will help facilitate the purchase and monitor status of sessions purchased. This is informational only and the Service Providers are considered to hold the official records.</p>
<p>All purchases made on Fitlis Site or Fitlis Application are governed by this Agreement. The Agreement governing any purchase will be that in effect at the date of your purchase. We reserve the right at our sole discretion to amend this Agreement at any time. If you purchase sessions after we have published any changes you will be bound by those changes. Accordingly, you should check prior to each purchase to ensure that you understand the precise terms and conditions applicable to your purchase. To assist you in determining whether the Agreement has changed since your most recent purchase we will display the date when this Agreement was most recently updated.</p>
<p>Refunds</p>
<p>All refund requests should be routed directly to the Service Provider. Once a purchase is completed via the Fitli services, it is considered non-refundable by fitli. Service providers have their own policies which Users should review before making purchases. Fitli accepts no liability for Services not performed or Services performed not to satisfaction by Service Providers.</p>

<li>Booking Sessions</li>

In response to a user’s online or mobile request for a booking through the Fitli Site or Fitli Application, Fitli directly contacts the Service Providers computerized database of bookings. The availability of bookings is determined at the time of user’s query. Once a booking is made by user through the Fitli Site or Fitli Application, Fitli will provide confirmation of the booking to user by email or text message (SMS). By using the Booking Services, user agrees to receive booking confirmations by email or text message after completing a booking through Booking Services. Once the session is booked, a session will be debited from Users available pre-purchased sessions.</p>
<p>Session Cancellations</p>
<p>Service Providers set and maintain their own Cancellation policies. If User requests cancellation of a booked session within pre-defined cancellation window set by Service Provider, the session will be automatically canceled from the Fitli Site or Fitli Application and the canceled session will be returned to the Users available pre-purchased sessions. However, if User requests cancellation of a booked session outside of pre-defined cancellation window set by Service Provider, the User will be unable to process the cancellation. Service Provide does have the ability to manually process a cancellation request within the pre-defined cancellation window at their discretion. If Service Provider manually processes the cancellation request, the cancelled session will be returned to the Users available pre-purchased sessions.</p>
<p>No-Shows</p>
<p>If User fails to appear at a booked session that has not been canceled prior to the session start time, the session will no longer be cancelable within the Fitli Services. Any additional recourse must be requested directly from the Service Provider.</p>
<p>Service Provider Waivers and Terms</p>

However, you will remain liable for any trailing activities related to your customer transactions, such as Chargebacks.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning September 1, 2023, Fitli will add Usio, Inc. as a payment processor for Fitli’s merchants.

Fitli will charge the following fees to business customers:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscription Fees – As described on the Fitli website and based upon the number of business user accounts created under your business account and whether you select monthly, annual, or semi-annual, you will be billed the appropriate subscription fees on the appropriate frequency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add-On Fees – Besides the standard Fitli subscriptions, Fitli has implemented additional optional features that carry their own incremental subscription fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACH Processing – Fitli has integrated ACH processing into our product, and each merchant can choose to activate ACH, allowing their customers to add a bank account and pay for products and services via ACH.&nbsp; There is a monthly subscription fee of $5 to unlock this capability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terminal / Point of Sale – Fitlis has integrated a Terminal capability into our product, and each merchant may choose to activate Terminal processing, allowing you to use a desktop or mobile terminal to accept payments. There is a monthly subscription fee of $5 to unlock this capability. You must also purchase an approved terminal directly from Usio, Inc. in order to use this capability.</span></p>
<p>Payment processing through Braintree is paid to Fitli, Inc., and those fees are as follows:</p>
<p>Transaction fees of 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for all standard card transactions. Fees related to transactions that are refunded are not returned.&nbsp; If you initiate a partial refund,&nbsp; you will be the standard transaction fee to process that transaction.

A series of unlikely but potential fees are detailed in the Usio, Inc. contract. Payment processing is provided to our merchants by Fitli’s integrated payment partner, Usio, Inc. Thus, All payment processing fees are paid directly to Usio, Inc. During the payment processing enrollment process, each merchant will have a contract directly with Usio, Inc.&nbsp; The contract includes all pricing for both card payments and ACH. Please refer to the contract for specific fee details.&nbsp; The pricing will be updated occasionally, and updated fee tables will be distributed directly from Usio to the merchants.</span></p>
