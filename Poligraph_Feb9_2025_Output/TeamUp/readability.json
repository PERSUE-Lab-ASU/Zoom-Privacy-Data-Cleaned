TeamUp allows Businesses to view and manage personal information from Users in order to facilitate the normal operations of a Business.</p>\n<h4>To provide, troubleshoot, and improve our services</h4>\n<p>It may sound obvious, but TeamUp uses a User\u2019s personal information to operate by displaying this data to that User as well as to Businesses they are associated with. Additionally, TeamUp may use this information to help troubleshoot issues, such as looking up a User by name or email address. We will also use personal information to help improve the Service, such as by analyzing data to prioritize features relevant to our Users.</p>\n<h4>To provide announcements about the Service</h4>\n<p>Occasionally we will notify Users of updates to the Service, changes to policies, and to disclose any issues that may put their personal information at risk.</p>\n<h3>Children</h3>\n<p>TeamUp is not intended to be directly used by anyone under the age of 13. A parent or guardian may utilize the Service on behalf of a child so long as they are using the Service for its intended purpose.
