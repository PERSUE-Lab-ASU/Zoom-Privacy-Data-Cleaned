We receive information in a few different ways, including when you check in and check out of a meeting, generate a meeting report as part of the Services. My Meeting Card also collects information about how you use the Services. There are a couple of opportunities for you to share information about yourself and your meeting attendance with My Meeting Card. For example: <strong>Account, Profile, Activity, and Use Information </strong>We collect&nbsp;<strong>basic account information</strong>&nbsp;such as your name, email address, date of birth, and password that helps secure and provide you with access to our Services. We also use dates of birth to enhance safety and privacy for our younger users to provide more accurate performance of the meeting verification.</p><p data-uniq-id=\"bBdSY\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-eQ_Wk\"><strong>Profile, activity and use information</strong>&nbsp;is collected about you when you choose to upload a picture, or create, check-in or check-out of a meeting (including date, time and geo-location information), or otherwise use the Services. We use your&nbsp;<strong>contact information</strong>&nbsp;so we can contact you when needed. For example, to respond to your support requests.</p><p data-uniq-id=\"bEAJH\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-eMRbX\"><strong>Location Information</strong></p><p data-uniq-id=\"dCkQe\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-rIBlg\">We collect and process&nbsp;<strong>location information</strong>&nbsp;when you sign up for and use the Services. We do not track your device location while you are not using the</p><p data-uniq-id=\"zRnBu\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-je38P\">Services. But in order to use our core features (e.g., GPS meeting creation, meeting check-in, and meeting check-out, etc.), it is necessary for you to</p><p data-uniq-id=\"h29WT\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-efjRy\">permit us to track your device location while you use the Services.

Should the user leave the designated meeting area, the app will send an alert message through the app stating that they must return to the meeting area or they will be logged out without the verification. Since the alert will only be received while using the mobile app, the SMS messaging feature was added to created another level of notification for that user. The user will receive a text notification through SMS messaging, that they have an alert in the My Meeting Card app. Users would have to allow this communication of SMS messaging and have the ability to enable/disable the SMS messaging through the settings in their mobile device.</p><p data-uniq-id=\"zCVXC\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-kZUXc\"><strong>Content You Share</strong></p><p data-uniq-id=\"ee5SS\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-eF3BT\">We gather information from the account profile created by the user,&nbsp;and other content you share on the Services.</p><p data-uniq-id=\"lYniQ\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-qmkw_\"><strong>Connected Devices and Apps</strong></p><p data-uniq-id=\"gm2qh\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-eAsic\">My Meeting Card collects information from&nbsp;<strong>devices and apps you connect to My Meeting Card</strong>, which will be used to troubleshoot issues users may experience using the mobile app.</p><p data-uniq-id=\"rYfWd\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-y4xxm\"><strong>Payment Information</strong></p><p data-uniq-id=\"t9Hpo\" data-generated-css=\"brz-css-fVita\">When you make a payment on My Meeting Card, you may provide&nbsp;<strong>payment information</strong>&nbsp;such as your payment card or other payment details.
