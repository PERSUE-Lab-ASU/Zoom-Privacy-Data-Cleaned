In such cases, Renaissance will redact such third party information.\n\t\t\tSecurity\n\t\t\tYour personally identifiable information will generally be stored in databases maintained by Renaissance or our service providers. Most of these databases are stored on servers located in the United States. Renaissance may use third-party storage or service-provider companies to store your personally identifiable information, some of which may be outside of the United States.\n\t\t\tWe have taken certain physical, electronic, contractual and administrative steps to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your personally identifiable information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your Website account information.\n\t\t\tInternational Transfer\n\t\t\tYour information may be transferred to\u2014and maintained on\u2014computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Renaissance transfers information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Website Privacy Notice followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.\n\t\t\tEU - U.S. Privacy Shield\n\t\t\tRenaissance participates in and complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the \u201cFramework\u201d). Renaissance has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit privacyshield.gov/. To view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Privacy Shield List.\n\t\t\tRenaissance is responsible for the processing of personal data it received, under the Framework. For personal data transferred from the EU, if Renaissance transfers your personal data to a third party, Renaissance will ensure that the third party is contractually obligated to process your data only for limited, specific purposes consistent with this Website Privacy Notice. Renaissance will also ensure that the third party will apply the same level of protection to that data as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles and will notify us if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet this obligation. Renaissance also complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for the onward transfer liability provisions. You have the option to request that your personal data not be disclosed to a third party, although this may impact your ability to access or the functionality of our products and services.\n\t\t\tYou can also request that the personal data not be used for a purpose materially different than that for which it was collected or authorized. Please use the contact information below to inquire further or to make a request.\n\t\t\tWith respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Framework, Renaissance is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Renaissance may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n\t\t\tIn compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Renaissance strives to resolve all complaints about privacy and the collection or use of customer information. If you have questions about our participation in the Privacy Shield program or have a complaint, please send an email to privacy@renaissance.com. If you have any unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider JAMS.\n\t\t\tUnder certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at  privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.\n\t\t\tLinks to Other Websites and Services\n\t\t\tUsers visiting our website may find links to websites owned and operated by other organizations.
