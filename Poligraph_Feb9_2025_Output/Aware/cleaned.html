<p>This Privacy Statement describes how Mimecast uses and protects information about an identified or identifiable natural person (collectively, “Personal Data”) collected through the Site, offline communications, as well as at programs and events, and explains our marketing practices generally. This Privacy Statement is incorporated into, and is a part of, our Terms of Use, found <a href="https://www.mimecast.com/legal/terms-of-use/">here</a>, which governs your access to and use of the Site.

</p>
<p>Mimecast has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles, including the onward transfer liability provisions. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Data Privacy Framework Principles (found <a href="https://www.mimecast.com/company/mimecast-trust-center/">here</a>), the Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view our certification, please visit: <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list</a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<h4 class="app-h4">Security</h4>
<p>At Mimecast, we are committed to maintaining the security of the Personal Data we collect from activity on this Site and from other marketing efforts, as well as through our Services.

However, the Other Data and IP Information collected may be retained, accessed, and used by us as long as necessary for the purposes described herein.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="what-about-cookies">What about cookies?</h3>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance our Services and Site. These technologies allow us, among other things, to store your preferences and settings, make it easier when you to sign-in, and analyze how our Site and Services are performing. You can learn more about our cookie practices below or by clicking <a href="https://www.mimecast.com/cookie-information/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>We (or our third-party service providers) may collect your Personal Data using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, embedded web links, and similar technologies for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Storing your preferences and settings - We may store Personal Data in a cookie so you will see relevant local information when you return to the Site. We also may save preferences, like language and browser so these do not have to be reset each time you return to the Site.</li>
    <li>Detecting abuse or fraud on the Site.</li>
    <li>Social Media - Our Site includes certain social media features (such as a “share” or “like” button). Those features are provided by the applicable social media platform (such as Twitter or Facebook). Where Personal Data is collected through the social media feature, the use of that Personal Data is governed by the privacy policy published by the social media platform that provides the feature.</li>
    <li>Internet-Based Advertising - We also use cookies, Other Data and IP Information to target advertising for our Services on third party sites.</li>
    <li>Showing advertising - We use cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on an advertisement and to record which advertisements you have seen so you don’t see the same one.</li>
    <li>Analytics - We use cookies to gather usage and performance data for the Site.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., to evaluate your use of the Site, compile reports on activity, and provide other services relating to Internet usage. Google Analytics uses first-party cookies that store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the web page before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page.
</p>
<p>We have also implemented Display Advertising Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. This means that third-party service providers, including Google, display our ads on sites across the Internet and that we and third-party service providers, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie, see: <a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick">http://www.google.com/doubleclick</a>) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Site.
</p>

<h3 id="how-long-will-you-use-my-personal-data">How long will you use my Personal Data?</h3>
<p>We will only retain your Personal Data and Other Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. We will also retain and use your Personal Data and Other Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our terms and conditions, other applicable terms of service and our policies.
</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity (if any) of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, and the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We also consider applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other requirements.
</p>
<p>In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data. Please see “What Are My Data Subject Rights and How Do I Exercise Them?” below.

<h3 id="what-are-my-data-subject-rights-and-how-do-i-exercise-them">What are my Data Subject Rights and how do I exercise them?</h3>
<p>You have rights with respect to the processing of the Personal Data that you have provided to us. For example, you may view, edit, delete, or move your Personal Data. In certain circumstances, you may object or withdraw your consent to certain processing of your Personal Data. You may also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Any of these rights may be exercised at any time. For customers of our customers, please contact your system administrator. For Mimecast direct customers/partner/contacts, you can exercise your rights via our <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/757ef5c8-f01d-4b1e-8d22-59f9254f3068/02d91e7f-d064-46d6-8b37-cf0ef670b739">dedicated online portal</a>. NOTE: We may ask you to verify your identity.
</p>
<p>Personal Data rights. You have the right to access and receive a copy of Personal Data that we hold about you, to rectify any Personal Data held about you that is inaccurate or, in certain circumstances, request the deletion of Personal Data held about you. You also have the right of data portability for Personal Data you have provided to us – this means that you can obtain a copy of your Personal Data in a commonly used machine-readable electronic format so that you can manage and move it, or request that we send it to a third party. You may have the right to restrict or object to the processing of your Personal Data by us, including for direct marketing. Where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time via our dedicated online portal <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/757ef5c8-f01d-4b1e-8d22-59f9254f3068/02d91e7f-d064-46d6-8b37-cf0ef670b739">here</a>. Please note these rights only apply in certain circumstances and may be limited by law. For example, where fulfilling your request would adversely affect other individuals or our trade secrets or intellectual property, where there are overriding public interests or where we are required by law to retain your Personal Data. We will respond to requests without undue delay and at least within one month (though this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances).
</p>
<p>Marketing. You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing at any time by contacting us at via our dedicated online portal <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/757ef5c8-f01d-4b1e-8d22-59f9254f3068/02d91e7f-d064-46d6-8b37-cf0ef670b739">here</a>, or by managing your subscription preferences through our Preference Center by clicking <a href="https://info.mimecast.com/Subscription-Management.html">here</a>.
