        <p>Users should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected on the Site through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are small text files stored as text on a computer hard drive. Web sites can use cookies to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor’s ongoing access to and use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements. Young Invincibles uses cookie technology to improve visitors’ online experience and facilitate their visit within our site. Our email vendor  </p>

        <p>If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. You can choose to prevent Young Invincibles from establishing a unique user-ID. We recommend that you visit any of the commonly available Cookie FAQs on the Internet to learn more about this. </p>

        <p>We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of the Site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit these sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit a site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to our sites by disabling cookies on your browser.</p>

We have no obligation to monitor Third Party Materials, and we may block or disable access to any Third Party Materials (in whole or part) through the Site at any time. In addition, the availability of any Third Party Materials through the Site does not imply our endorsement of, or our affiliation with, any provider of such Third Party Materials, nor does such availability create any legal relationship between you, us and/or any such provider. </p>

When deauthorizing the Connector from their Zoom account, users may select a data retention preference with the option to allow the Connector to retain their user information.  In all cases we delete the user data from our system, regardless of this preference.</p>
