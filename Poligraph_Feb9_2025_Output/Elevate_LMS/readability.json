Then you can add your account and users as described above.</p>\n    <p>You will see instructions along the way, but it may be helpful to review the process described below for adding your account.</p>\n    \n    \n    <h3>Adding Elevate Integration to your Zoom Account</h3>\n    <p>To add Elevate Integration to your Zoom account, you must be an admin in your Elevate site, and an admin in your Zoom account. If you are not an admin of your Zoom account, ask someone who is an admin to help you.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Adding your Zoom Account to Elevate</h3>\n    <p>Start by logging into your Elevate site, at your Elevate custom domain, if you have one, as a user with the required admin permissions to edit \"Remote Accounts\". Go to Settings-&gt;Site Setup -&gt; Remote Accounts, then go to the Zoom tab.</p>\n    <p>On that tab, you should see a list of Zoom accounts that are integrated with your Elevate account.</p>\n    <p>You must first add your Zoom Account, by clicking the \"Add Zoom Account Using Oauth\" button.</p>\n    <p>After a confirmation, this will take you to a Zoom page where you can see the features and data that Elevate needs to access to integrate with your Zoom webinars.</p>\n    <p>You must click \"Accept\" there, and you will be returned to this page with your Zoom admin account added here.</p>\n    <p>You will now be able to choose that Zoom user's account, when setting up new Zoom Webinar components. It will allow you to create new Webinars, as well as choose existing Webinars in your Zoom account to use as Elevate Webinar Components.</p>\n    <p>NOTE: Choosing an existing Webinar will change various settings of the Webinar to allow Elevate to control access to it, to prevent others from signing in for free via any Zoom registration page, and to launch users who registered for your Elevate product containing the webinar, into the Zoom Webinar when the live webinar is open.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Adding Additional Zoom Users to Elevate</h3>\n    <p>Once a Zoom account has been added to Elevate, you will see, underneath it, on the list on the Remote Accounts -&gt; Zoom page, a button for \"Add Additional Zoom User\".</p>\n    <p>Clicking this will allow you to enter the email address of another, non-admin, user in that same account.</p>\n    <p>Once you submit, it will check if that user exists, and if they have a webinar license. If they do, they will be added as another Zoom account that can be used to create and manage Zoom webinars as Elevate components.</p>\n              \n    <h3>Using Elevate Zoom Integration</h3>\n    <p>Once a Zoom account has been added to Elevate, you will be able to use it when creating Webinars as Product Components.</p>\n    <p>When adding Components to a product, if the Component Type is Web Content, and Component is Live, you will find Zoom as one of the options under Content Type.</p>\n    <p>Select Zoom, and you will be able to select one of your Zoom Accounts below that, and finally, you will be able to click either the Create Webinar, which will create a webinar base on the settings of the component, or Choose Existing Webinar, which will connect a webinar you have already created in your Zoom account to that Component.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Removing Your Zoom account from Elevate, and Deactivating Elevate Integration in your Zoom account.</h3>\n    <p>At any time, you can disconnect your Zoom Account from  your Elevate account that you wish to remove.</p>\n    <p>First, you will have to edit or remove all Elevate webinar components created using any of the users in your Zoom account.</p>\n    <p>Next, on the Settings-&gt;Site Setup-&gt;Remote Accounts-&gt;Zoom page, click the remove buttons, first on any Additional Users/</p>\n    <p>Then if you want to fully remove your Zoom account from Elevate, click remove on the main admin account itself.</p>\n    <p>Then, to complete the process, log into your Zoom account as an Admin. Go to Advanced -&gt; App Marketplace. Click the \"Manage\" button in the top right. Then click on \"Added Apps\" in the left column. Find the \"Elevate LMS\" app. Click the \"Remove\" button on the right end of that row. This removes the permissions that you granted the Elevate LMS app to your account, and revokes any and all access.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h3>\n    <p>By completing the Zoom Oauth App Connection process, you are granting your Elevate site the ability create, manage, and launch webinars, to create and register participants, to access webinar information and reporting information, and to access some of your Zoom account information.
