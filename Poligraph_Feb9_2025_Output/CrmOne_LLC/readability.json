How We Use Personal Data</p>\n          <p><strong>a. To Communicate with You About the Product and Services</strong></p>\n          <p>We use the account information you provide to CrmOne when signing up for the Subscription Service and\n              Trends services to send you transactional emails or in-app notification about billing, account\n              management, and other administrative matters. We may also send you updates regarding our Customer\n              Terms of Service or other legal agreements, and may also communicate with you about security\n              incidents via email or in-app notification. </p>\n          <p>We use your information to provide customer support, such as resolving technical issues you encounter\n              and analysing product outages or bugs.</p>\n          <p>If you use the CrmOne mobile applications, we may send you push notifications from time to time in\n              order to update you about events and promotions.

To Provide the Subscription Service</strong></p>\n          <p>We use your account information and Customer Data to provide the product and services to you. For\n              example, we use the email address you provide when signing up for the product to create your user\n              account, and we use your payment information to process payments for paid use of the Subscription\n              Service. We also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer\n              support.</p>\n          <p><strong>c. To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services</strong></p>\n          <p>We collect usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services. We use this\n              data to develop and improve our products and services. For example, we use usage data to assess\n              trends and usage across the product to help us determine what new features or integrations our users\n              may be interested in. </p>\n          <p>We use Customer Data for machine learning that supports certain products and development of features\n              and functionality with the Subscription Service and similar products and services. For example,\n              machine learning helps power the business card scanner tool if you use our mobile apps and allows\n              for easier imports of data into your CrmOne account. You may opt-out of having your Customer Data\n              used for machine learning by emailing at <a href=\"mailto:connect@crmone.com\">connect@crmone.com</a> </p>\n          <p>We may publish data about how our product and services are being used across our customer base. When\n              we share statistical information externally in this way, the data will be aggregated and we will not\n              identify individual users or customers. For example, we may publish blog posts on trends or insights\n              into how users are interacting with our product. </p>\n          <p><strong>d. To Secure and Protect our Product and CrmOne Users</strong></p>\n          <p>We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents.

This includes enforcing our Customer\n              Terms of Service..</p>\n          <p>We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how\n              you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and\n              regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also\n              collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns,\n              investigate security events and incidents. For these purposes we do link this\n              automatically-collected data to other personal data provided by you such as name, email address,\n              address, and phone number. </p>\n          <p><strong>e.

If you have a call scheduled with a CrmOne representative, we may record and\n              transcribe the call.

These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Data\n              except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your\n              information. In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the\n              third party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies\n              and standards.</p>\n          <p><strong>b.

In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our\n              website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding\n              your Personal Data.</p>\n          <p><strong>d. Public Forums</strong></p>\n          <p>Our websites may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums (e.g. CrmOne\n              Community and Connect.com).

We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the websites if\n              you so request, as described in Section 7 \u201cYour Privacy Rights and Choices\u201d below. In some cases, we\n              may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to\n              and why.</p>\n          <p><strong>e. Compelled Disclosure</strong></p>\n          <p>We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably\n              believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety\n              of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process.

When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA,\n              Switzerland or UK with third parties, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer\n              including the European Commission-approved Data Privacy Framework Standard Contractual Clauses, as\n              well as additional safeguards where appropriate. For transfers to or from the United Kingdom, we\n              make use of the UK Addendum. For transfers to or from Canada, we make use of the standard\n              contractual clauses.

The regulation builds on many of the 1995 Directive\u2019s requirements\n              for data privacy and security, but includes several new provisions to bolster the rights of data\n              subjects and add harsher penalties for violations. The regulate came into effect on May 25th, 2018.\n          </p>\n          <p>What was the story before the GDPR?</p>\n          <p>\n              You\u2019ve likely heard a lot about the GDPR in 2018, but did you know we\u2019ve had data protection\n              legislation in the EU for quite a while already? Although the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive was\n              replaced by the GPDR in May 2018, the Directive sets out the eight data protection principles which\n              have been governing the treatment of personal data by&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;for over two decades!\n          </p>\n          <p>Does the GDPR apply to me?</p>\n          <p>\n              The GDPR applies to businesses that a) market their products to people in the EU or who b) monitor\n              the behavior of people in the EU. In other words, even if you\u2019re based outside of the EU but you\n              control or process the data of EU citizens, the GDPR will apply to you.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n              <strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong> This website is neither a magnum opus on EU data privacy nor legal\n              advice for your\n              company to use in complying with EU data privacy laws like the GDPR. Instead, it provides background\n              information to help you better understand how CrmOne has addressed some important legal points. This\n              legal information is not the same as legal advice, where an attorney applies the law to your\n              specific circumstances, so we insist that you consult an attorney if you\u2019d like advice on your\n              interpretation of this information or its accuracy. In a nutshell, you may not rely on this paper as\n              legal advice, nor as a recommendation of any particular legal understanding.\n          </p>\n          <p>Important components of the GDPR</p>\n          <ul>\n              <li>Individual\u2019s Rights</li>\n              <li>Internal Procedures</li>\n              <li>Supervisory Authorities</li>\n              <li>Scope, Accountability and Penalties</li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>Consent&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>The GDPR steps up the standard for disclosures when obtaining consent, as it needs to be \u201cfreely\n              given, specific, informed and unambiguous,\u201d with controllers using \u201cclear and plain\u201d legal language\n              that is \u201cclearly distinguishable from other matters\u201d. Controllers will also be required to provide\n              evidence that their processes are compliant and followed in each case.</p>\n          <p>Essentially, your customer cannot be forced into consent, or be unaware that they are consenting to\n              processing of their personal data. They must also know exactly what they are consenting to and they\n              must be informed in advance of their right to withdraw that consent. Obtaining consent requires a\n              positive indication of agreement \u2013 it cannot be inferred from silence, pre-ticked boxes or\n              inactivity. This means that informing the user during the opt-in is becoming more important.</p>\n          <p>New Rights for Individuals</p>\n          <p>The regulation also builds in two new rights for data subjects: a \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d&nbsp;that\n              requires controllers to alert downstream recipients of deletion requests and a \u201cright to data\n              portability\u201d&nbsp;that allows data subjects to demand a copy of their data in a common format. These two\n              rights make it easier for users to request that any information stored should be deleted or that\n              information that has been collected should be shared with them.</p>\n          <p>Access Requests</p>\n          <p>Data subjects always had a right to request access to their data. But the GDPR enhances these rights.\n              In most cases, you will not be able to charge for processing an access request, unless you can\n              demonstrate that the cost will be excessive. The timescale for processing an access request will\n              also drop to a one month period but this can be extended a further two months in some circumstances.\n              In certain cases, organizations may refuse to grant an access request, for example where the request\n              is deemed manifestly unfounded or excessive. However, organizations will need to have clear refusal\n              policies and procedures in place, and demonstrate why the request meets these criteria.</p>\n          <p>Privacy by Design and DPIA</p>\n          <p>There are several new principles for entities that handle personal data, including a requirement to\n              build in data privacy&nbsp;\u201cby design\u201d&nbsp;when developing new systems and an obligation to perform a Data\n              Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) when processing using&nbsp;\u201cnew technologies\u201d&nbsp;or in risky ways. A DPIA\n              is the process of systematically considering the potential impact that a project or initiative might\n              have on the privacy of individuals so that potential privacy issues can be identified before they\n              arise, giving the organization time to come up with a way to mitigate them before the project is\n              underway.</p>\n          <p>Data Privacy Officer</p>\n          <p>On the security side, the GDPR requires many businesses to have a Data Privacy Officer (DPO) to help\n              oversee their compliance efforts. Organizations requiring DPOs include public authorities,\n              organizations whose activities involve the regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a\n              large scale, or organizations who process sensitive personal data on a large scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>Contracts &amp; Privacy Documentation</p>\n          <p>Since the GDPR is all about transparency and fairness, Controllers and Processors need to review\n              their Privacy Notices, Privacy Statements, and any internal data policies to ensure they meet the\n              requirements under the GDPR. If a Controller engages third party vendors to process the personal\n              data under their control, they need to ensure their contracts with those Processors are updated to\n              include the new, mandatory Processor provisions set out in Article 28 of the Regulation. Similarly,\n              Processors should consider what changes they\u2019ll need to make to their customer contracts to be GDPR\n              compliant.</p>\n          <p>One-Stop Shop</p>\n          <p>One particular item in the GDPR should serve to make the lives of these Data Protection Officers\n              easier: the GDPR\u2019s new&nbsp;\u201cone stop shop\u201d&nbsp;provision, under which organizations with offices in multiple\n              EU countries will have a&nbsp;\u201clead supervisory authority\u201d&nbsp;to act as a central point of enforcement so\n              they don\u2019t struggle with inconsistent directions from multiple supervisory authorities.</p>\n          <p>Reporting Breaches</p>\n          <p>The GDPR contains a requirement that controllers must notify their country\u2019s supervisory authority of\n              a personal data breach within 72 hours of learning of it unless the data was anonymize or encrypted.\n              In practice, this will mean that most data breaches must be reported to the Data Protection\n              Commissioner. &nbsp;Breaches that are likely to bring harm to an individual \u2013 such as identity theft or\n              breach of confidentiality \u2013 must also be reported to the individuals concerned.</p>\n          <p>Scope</p>\n          <p>The GDPR applies to non-EU businesses who market their products to people in the EU or who monitor\n              the behavior of people in the EU. In other words, even if you\u2019re based outside of the EU but you\n              control or process the data of EU citizens, the GDPR&nbsp;likely applies to you.</p>\n          <p>Accountability</p>\n          <p>This concept requires Controllers and Processors to be able to demonstrate their compliance with the\n              GDPR to their local supervisory authority. Processes should be recorded, implemented and reviewed on\n              a regular basis. Staff should be trained and appropriate technical and organizational measures\n              should be taken to ensure and demonstrate compliance.</p>\n          <p>Severe Penalties</p>\n          <p>The importance of the GDPR\u2019s new provisions is underscored by the new penalties it imposes for\n              violations. Depending on the type of violation in question, controllers and processors who mishandle\n              personal data or otherwise violate data subjects\u2019 rights could incur fines of up to \u20ac20 million or\n              4% of their global annual turnover&nbsp;(whichever is greater).</p>\n          <p>If you\u2019re already a CrmOne customer or partner, please contact your account manager if you have any\n              further questions, comments or suggestions.</p>\n          <p>What did the law say before the GDPR?</p>\n          <p>Although the DPD was replaced by the GPDR, it sets out the eight data protection principles which the\n              GDPR builds on. These rules govern how organizations should treat personal data and are set out\n              below:</p>\n          <p>Obtain and process the personal data fairly</p>\n          <p>Keep it only for one or more specified and lawful purposes</p>\n          <p>Process it only in ways compatible with the purposes for which it was given to you initially</p>\n          <p>Keep it safe and secure</p>\n          <p>Keep it accurate and up-to-date</p>\n          <p>Ensure that it is adequate, relevant and not excessive</p>\n          <p>Retain it no longer than is necessary for the specified purpose or purposes</p>\n          <p>Give a copy of his/her personal data to any individual, on request.</p>\n          <p>The DPD&nbsp;was a Directive, which is a legislative act that sets out a goal that all EU countries must\n              achieve. However, it is up to the individual countries to devise their own laws on how to reach\n              these goals. In Ireland for example, the goals of the DPD were implemented through the Irish Data\n              Protection Act, 1998.</p>\n          <p>A Regulation on the other hand, such as the GDPR, is a binding legislative act which applies in its\n              entirety across the EU.&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>Is double-opt-in mandatory?</p>\n          <p>For those unfamiliar with the term, \u201cdouble-opt-in\u201d is a 2-step mechanism where a person must confirm\n              their email address after initially signing up. The GDPR does not require double-opt-in (though\n              certain countries may make this mandatory).</p>\n          <p>It\u2019s worth noting that subscribers to the CrmOne service may already choose to enable double-opt-in\n              functionality in their portals as an additional protective measure in proving they obtained the\n              required consent.</p>\n          <p>How will Brexit impact the compliance for businesses based in the UK?</p>\n          <p>In June 2016, a majority of UK voters voted in favour of leaving the EU in the&nbsp;\u201cBrexit\u201d&nbsp;referendum.\n              In March 2017, Theresa May gave notice to leave the EU under Art. 50 which triggered the\n              commencement of the Brexit negotiations.&nbsp;This regulator resource may be helpful as the terms of\n              Brexit morph over time:</p>\n          <p>If you\u2019re based outside the UK but have vendors or affiliates in the UK with whom you share personal\n              data, you\u2019ll also need to keep an eye on developments in this area. When the UK leaves, cross-border\n              data flows may not automatically have adequate safeguards&nbsp;and therefore additional projections may\n              be required to protect data you transfer to the UK.</p>\n          <p>How are the Rights of Individuals affected by the GDPR?</p>\n          <p>Individuals already&nbsp;had a lot of rights which protected their personal data under the 1995 Data\n              Protection Directive, but the GDPR significantly strengthened these rights such that data subjects\n              can now:</p>\n          <p>obtain details about how their data is processed by an organization or business;</p>\n          <p>obtain copies of personal data that an organization holds on them;</p>\n          <p>have incorrect or incomplete data corrected;</p>\n          <p>have their data erased by an organization, where, for example, the organization has no legitimate\n              reason for retaining the data;</p>\n          <p>obtain their data from an organization and to have that data transmitted to another organization\n              (Data Portability);</p>\n          <p>object to the processing of their data by an organization in certain circumstances;</p>\n          <p>not to be subject to (with some exceptions) automated decision making, including profiling.</p>\n          <p>Does EU data now have to be stored in the EU?</p>\n          <p>No. There is no obligation under the GDPR for data to be stored in the EU and the rules regarding\n              transfer of personal data outside the EU will not change. This means that, as long as the personal\n              data is&nbsp;\u201cadequately protected\u201d, data may be transferred abroad. For example, the EU has prepared a\n              list of countries which they deem to provide an adequate standard of protection (known as&nbsp;\u201cwhite\n              listed countries\u201d), so it is permissible to transfer data to those countries. Where a country is not\n              on that EU list (for example, the USA), the controller must rely on use of approved contractual\n              provisions (e.g. the Model Clauses or Corporate Binding Rules) or one of the other alternative\n              measures, provided for in Law, such as the Privacy Shield certification.</p>\n          <p>Where can I find additional resources?</p>\n          <p>We\u2019ve compiled a list of additional sites for more information around the new regulation down below.\n              Please feel free to check them out.&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>The Irish Data Protection Commissioner\u2019s GDPR</p>\n          <p>Guidance from the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protections\u2019 on the GDPR</p>\n          <p>EU Data Protection Supervisor</p>\n          <p>Find your Supervisory Authority</p>\n          <p>Full text of the GDPR</p>\n          <p>Full text of the GDPR in German</p>\n          <p>The EU\u2019s GDPR</p>\n          <p>The UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office</p>\n          <p>Are you GDPR ready?</p>\n          <p>Read through our checklist to find out more.</p>\n          <p>Since every business is different and the GDPR takes a risk-based approach to data protection,\n              companies should work to&nbsp;assess their own data collection and storage practices&nbsp;(including the ways\n              they use CrmOne\u2019s marketing and sales tools), seek their own legal advice to ensure that their\n              business practices&nbsp;comply with the GDPR.&nbsp;In determining your next steps, here are some of the\n              questions you should consider.&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>The Assessment</p>\n          <p>What personal data do we collect/store?</p>\n          <p>Have we obtained it fairly? Do we have the necessary consents required and were the data subjects\n              informed of the specific purpose for which we\u2019ll use their data?

For example,\n              will encryption or pseudonymisation be required to protect the personal data we hold? &nbsp;Are we\n              limiting access to ensure it is only being used for its intended purpose?</p>\n          <p>Are we collecting or processing any special categories of personal data, such as \u2018Sensitive Personal\n              Data\u2019, children\u2019s data, biometric or genetic data etc. and if so, are we meeting the standards to\n              collect, process and store it?</p>\n          <p>Are we transferring the personal data outside the EU and if so, do we have adequate protections in\n              place?</p>\n          <p>The GDPR Project Plan</p>\n          <p>Have we put a project plan together to ensure compliance by the May 2018 deadline?</p>\n          <p>Have we secured buy-in at executive level to ensure we have the required resources and budget on hand\n              to move the project forward?</p>\n          <p>Do we require a Data Privacy Impact Assessment?</p>\n          <p>Do we need to hire a Data Privacy Officer?</p>\n          <p>Are we implementing a policy of \u2018Data Protection by Design and Default\u2019 to ensure we\u2019re\n              systematically considering the potential impact that a project or initiative might have on the\n              privacy of individuals?</p>\n          <p>Have we considered how we handle employee data in our plan?</p>\n          <p>The Procedures and Controls</p>\n          <p>Are our Security team informed to ensure they\u2019re aware of their obligations under the GDPR and do\n              they have sufficient resources to implement any required changes or new processes?</p>\n          <p>Do we have procedures in place to handle requests from data subjects to modify, delete or access\n              their personal data? Do these procedures comply the new rules under the GDPR?</p>\n          <p>Do we have security notification procedures in place to ensure we meet our enhanced reporting\n              obligations under the GDPR in case of a data breach in a timely manner?</p>\n          <p>Are our staff trained in all areas of EU data privacy to ensure they handle data in a compliant\n              manner?</p>\n          <p>Do we review and audit the data we hold on a regular basis?</p>\n          <p>The Documentation</p>\n          <p>Do we have a Privacy Policy in place and if so, do we need to update it to comply with the GDPR?</p>\n          <p>Do we have a defined policy on retention periods for all items of personal data, from customer,\n              prospect and vendor data to employee data? Is it compliant with the GDPR?</p>\n          <p>Are our internal procedures adequately documented?</p>\n          <p>If we\u2019re a data processor, have we updated our contracts with the relevant controllers to ensure they\n              include the mandatory provisions set out in Art. 28 of the GDPR?</p>\n          <p>In cases where our third party vendors are processing personal data on our behalf, have we ensured\n              our contracts with them have been updated to include those same processor requirements under the\n              GDPR?</p>\n          <p>Disclaimer</p>\n          <p>This legal information is not the same as legal advice, where an attorney applies the law to your\n              specific circumstances, so we insist that you consult an attorney if you\u2019d like advice on your\n              interpretation of this information or its accuracy. In a nutshell, you may not rely on this paper as\n              legal advice, nor as a recommendation of any particular legal understanding.</p>\n          <p>Personal data</p>\n          <p>Any information related to a person or contact, for example: name, national ID number, address, IP\n              address, etc. This type of information is also known as personally identifiable information (PII).\n          </p>\n          <p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</p>\n          <p>A European Union (EU) law that protects the personal data of EU and European Economic Area citizens\n              and residents. It outlines requirements necessary for both EU businesses and any business that\n              collects or processes this personal data. Similar requirements can also be found in many national\n              data privacy laws outside of the EU.</p>\n          <p>Controller</p>\n          <p>A business or person that decides why and how to process data about a person. One example is a\n              business owner serving as a Controller over its data stored in CrmOne, where the business makes\n              decisions about how to use the data. Note: A business or person can be both a controller and a\n              processor at the same time.</p>\n          <p>Processor</p>\n          <p>A business or person that processes data. They process the data as instructed, but don\u2019t have control\n              over how or why it\u2019s processed. For example, CrmOne is a processor for a business owner when CrmOne\n              stores and processes data based on the business owner\u2019s instructions. Note: A business or person can\n              be both a controller and a processor at the same time.</p>\n          <p>Processing (data processing)</p>\n          <p>Any action performed on personal data. This can be automated or manual. Examples include: collecting,\n              organizing, recording, storing, or deleting data.</p>\n          <p>Consent</p>\n          <p>Giving permission to use or share data. This could be done via opting-in or can be implied.</p>\n          <p>Under the GDPR and similar data privacy laws, consent must be freely given, specific, informed and\n              unambiguous. Consent must be positive and affirmative, and in some cases it must be explicitly\n              given.</p>\n          <p>Affirmative or explicit consent</p>\n          <p>When a person communicates clear approval and agreement to process their data. For example,\n              responding \u201cYes\u201d to receiving text messages from a business.</p>\n          <p>Implicit consent</p>\n          <p>When consent can reasonably be assumed from a person\u2019s action or inaction. For example, when a\n              customer buys a product from a business, their personal data would be processed in order to ship the\n              product, to provide customer support, etc.</p>\n          <p>Consent to process (data)</p>\n          <p>When a contact has agreed to the collecting, storing, sending, etc. of their data, also known as\n              processing data. Under the GDPR and other privacy laws, this permission must be \u201cfreely given,\n              specific, informed and unambiguous.\u201d</p>\n          <p>Consent to communicate</p>\n          <p>When a contact has given permission to be contacted or receive communication. For example, via SMS,\n              email, etc.</p>\n          <p>Double opt in</p>\n          <p>A type of consent that requires two separate positive actions. For example, to double-opt-in to\n              receive marketing emails would mean first signing up for the emails, then clicking on a separate\n              email confirmation link. </p>\n  \n      </div>\n\n      <div><p>.\n\n          </p><h3><span id=\"App_Partner_Program\"></span>App Partner Program<span></span></h3>\n          <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS APP PARTNER PROGRAM AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.</strong></p>\n          <p>This is a contract between you (the Company) and us (CrmOne).

The start of the Customer\u2019s subscription is determined\n                  by the date of the first purchase or sign up (as applicable) of the Subscription Service by the\n                  Customer and you will receive a Commission payment for that Customer Transaction only,\n                  regardless of any additional purchases made by that customer during their Subscription Service.\n                  For example, if the initial Customer Transaction is for one user of Sales Hub Professional, and\n                  there is a subsequent purchase by that same customer for an additional user of Sales Hub\n                  Professional for the same subscription, Affiliate will receive Commission for the initial user\n                  purchase only. The Affiliate will not be entitled to receive Commission on any additional\n                  purchases of CrmOne Products by that same Customer.</li>\n              <li>Eligibility. To be eligible for Commission (i) an Affiliate Lead must be accepted and valid in\n                  accordance with the \u2018Acceptance and Validity\u2019 section, (ii) a Customer Transaction must have\n                  occurred, (iii) a Customer must remain a customer during the locking period in the Affiliate\n                  Tool (or if applicable, in the Program Policies). You are not eligible to receive Commission or\n                  any other compensation from us based on transactions for Other Products or if: (i) such\n                  compensation is disallowed or limited by federal, state or local law or regulation in the United\n                  States or the laws or regulations of your jurisdiction; (ii) the applicable Customer objects to\n                  or prohibits such compensation or excludes such compensation from its payments to us or CrmOne\n                  Affiliates; (iii) the Customer has paid or will pay such commissions, referral fees, or other\n                  compensation directly to you, (iv) the Commission payment has been obtained by fraudulent means,\n                  misuse of the Affiliate Link, in violation of any Affiliate Program Policies that we make\n                  available to you, misuse of the Affiliate Tool or by any other means that we deem to breach the\n                  spirit of the Affiliate Program, or (v) the Customer participates in any of our partner\n                  programs, including our Agency Partner Program, Sales Referral Partner Program or Sales\n                  Solutions Partner Program and is eligible to receive commission in relation to the Customer\n                  Transaction under any of these programs. If at any point you are eligible to receive a revenue\n                  share payment or commission under another Program at CrmOne, that payment amount will not change\n                  based on your participation in the Affiliate Program. For example, you will not be able to\n                  receive the Commission set out in this Agreement on any Partner Transaction that was completed\n                  whilst participating as a partner in the Solutions Partner Program (as defined in the Solutions\n                  Partner Program Agreement). In competitive situations with other affiliates, we may elect to\n                  provide the Commission to the affiliate that we deem to be the most eligible for Commission, at\n                  our discretion. We may discontinue Commission payments should any of the eligibility criteria\n                  set forth in this subsection fail to be met at any time. </li>\n              <li>Acceptance and Validity. You will only be eligible for a Commission payment for any Customer\n                  Transactions that derived from Affiliate Leads generated by the Affiliate Link that we make\n                  available to you and are accepted by CrmOne. An Affiliate Lead will be considered valid and\n                  accepted if, in our reasonable determination: (i) it is a new potential customer of ours, and\n                  (ii) is not, at the time of submission or sixty (60) days prior, one of our pre-existing\n                  customers, or involved in our active sales process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may choose\n                  not to accept an Affiliate Lead in our reasonable discretion. If an Affiliate Lead does not\n                  purchase the Subscription Service within the time period described on the Affiliate Tool (or if\n                  applicable, in the Program Policies) of their first click on the Affiliate Link, you will not be\n                  eligible for a Commission payment, even if the Affiliate Lead decides to purchase after the time\n                  period has expired. An Affiliate Lead is not considered valid if its first click on the\n                  Affiliate Link is after this Agreement has expired or terminated. Engagement with Prospects.\n                  Once we have received the Affiliate Lead information, we may elect to engage with the prospect\n                  directly, regardless of whether or not the Affiliate Lead is valid. If an Affiliate Lead is not\n                  valid then we may choose to maintain it in our database and we may choose to engage with such\n                  Affiliate Lead. Any engagement between CrmOne and an Affiliate Lead will be at CrmOne\u2019s\n                  discretion.</li>\n              <li>Commission and Payment. In order to receive payment under this Agreement, you must have: (i)\n                  agreed to the terms of this Agreement (generally completed through the Affiliate Tool); (ii)\n                  completed all steps necessary to create your account in the Affiliate Tool in accordance with\n                  our directions, (iii) have a valid and up-to-date payment method in the Affiliate Tool with such\n                  account (iv) completed any and all required tax documentation in order for the Affiliate Tool to\n                  process any payments that may be owed to you.</li>\n              <li>Requirements for Payment; Forfeiture. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary\n                  in this Agreement, if any of the requirements set forth in section 4(a)(i-iv) remain outstanding\n                  for six (6) months immediately following the close of a Customer Transaction, then your right to\n                  receive Commission arising from any and all Customer Transactions with the associated Customer\n                  will be forever forfeited (each, a \u201cForfeited Transaction\u201d). We will have no obligation to pay\n                  you the Commission associated with a Forfeited Transaction. Once you comply with all of the\n                  requirements in section 5(a)(i-iv), then you will be eligible to receive Commission on Customer\n                  Transactions, as long as these Customer Transactions do not involve the same Customer associated\n                  with a Forfeited Transaction.</li>\n              <li>Commission Payment. We or the Affiliate Tool will determine the currency in which we pay the\n                  Commission, as well as the applicable conversion rate. We will not pay more than one Commission\n                  payment or other similar referral fee on any given Customer Transaction (unless we choose to in\n                  our discretion). Taxes. You are responsible for payment of all taxes and fees (including bank\n                  fees) applicable to the Commission. All amounts payable by us to you are subject to offset by us\n                  against any amounts owed by you to us. Commission Amounts. We reserve the right to alter or\n                  change the Commission amount as per the Affiliate Tool. </li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>Training and Support</p>\n          <p>We may make available to you, without charge, various webinars and other resources made available as\n              part of our Affiliate Program.

We may change or\n              discontinue any or all parts of the Affiliate Program benefits or offerings at any time without\n              notice.</p>\n          <p>Trademarks</p>\n          <p>You grant to us a nonexclusive, non transferable, royalty-free right to use and display your\n              trademarks, service marks and logos (\u201cAffiliate Marks\u201d) in connection with the Affiliate Program and\n              this Agreement.</p>\n          <p>During the term of this Agreement, in the event that we make our trademark available to you within\n              the Affiliate Tool, you may use our trademark as long as you follow the usage requirements in this\n              section.

If this increase applies to\n              you, we will notify you in advance of your renewal and the increased fees will apply at the start of\n              the next renewal term.

We\u2019ve also formed a multi-member Content Review Committee (CRC)\n              composed of diverse leaders from different parts and locations of CrmOne, which is responsible for\n              reviewing reports about CrmOne users who engage in these activities, and determining what actions to\n              take. </p>\n          <p>The CrmOne content moderation program is intended to help us make decisions about certain users of\n              our platform and the content we will allow (and not allow). It also helps us live up to our core\n              values and principles as a company. It does not supplant the AUP or address other violations of the\n              AUP \u2013 for example, we will still take action against illegal content, spammers, those abusing our\n              platform, pornography, etc. under separate processes and guidelines.</p>\n          <p>Complaints regarding CrmOne users may be provided by our employees, our customers or partners, or by\n              anyone from the public.

If you are a Service Provider, you must respond to inquiries or issues regarding\n              your Service Offerings within a reasonable period of time. If you are listed as a Service Provider,\n              we also expect that Service Offerings you provide are done so with good quality and in a\n              professional and workmanlike manner, in addition to any other industry standards, laws, or\n              regulations governing the quality and timeliness of your Service Offering.

These features\n              may allow you to earn advocacy points (\u201cPoints\u201d) for participating in various marketing and\n              promotional activities, as described in the Customer Advocacy Guidelines that may be in effect from\n              time to time, which we will publish at or other website we may designate. There is no cost or\n              minimum participation threshold to participate. Points are valid for one year following the year in\n              which they were earned. Points have no monetary value, do not constitute property of the\n              participant, and are not transferable. Any gift cards or merchandise redemption\u2019s may be considered\n              taxable income and are the personal responsibility of the gift card redeemer to report.

If you elect to share CrmOne news or information, including links, through\n              your own social media accounts, you agree to always use hashtag #CrmOneAdvocate to identify your\n              relationship with CrmOne in such posts.</p>\n          <p>Participation in customer advocacy activities and benefits is at CrmOne\u2019s sole discretion, and CrmOne\n              may, in its sole discretion, terminate any participant\u2019s access to customer advocacy features or\n              suspend their eligibility to participate in customer advocacy activities or benefits, without\n              notice, for any conduct that CrmOne, in its sole discretion, believes is in violation of any\n              applicable law, is inconsistent with these terms or their purpose, or is otherwise harmful to the\n              interests of CrmOne or the Community. Upon termination, all accumulated and remaining Points shall\n              become void and irredeemable.

You also acknowledge and agree\n              that you will exercise your audit rights under Clause 8.9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses by\n              instructing us to comply with the measures described in the \u2018Demonstration of Compliance\u2019 section of\n              this DPA. </p>\n          <p> (e) Where the CrmOne contracting entity under the Agreement is not CrmOne, Inc., such contracting\n              entity (not CrmOne, Inc.) will remain fully and solely responsible and liable to you for the\n              performance of the Standard Contractual Clauses by CrmOne, Inc., and you will direct any\n              instructions, claims or enquiries in relation to the Standard Contractual Clauses to such\n              contracting entity. If CrmOne cannot comply with its obligations under the Standard Contractual\n              Clauses or is breach of any warranties under the Standard Contractual Clauses or UK Addendum (as\n              applicable) for any reason, and you intend to suspend the transfer of European Data to CrmOne or\n              terminate the Standard Contractual Clauses ,or UK Addendum, you agree to provide us with reasonable\n              notice to enable us to cure such non-compliance and reasonably cooperate with us to identify what\n              additional safeguards, if any, may be implemented to remedy such non-compliance. If we have not or\n              cannot cure the non-compliance, you may suspend or terminate the affected part of the Subscription\n              Service in accordance with the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to\n              any fees you have incurred prior to such suspension or termination).</p>\n          <p> (C) Alternative Transfer Mechanism.

For more\n              information on these security measures, please refer to CrmOne\u2019s SOC 2 Type II Report, SOC 3 Report,\n              Security Overview and Penetration Test Summaries</p>\n          <p><strong> a) Access Control</strong></p>\n          <p> i) Preventing Unauthorized Product Access</p>\n          <p> Outsourced processing: We host our Service with outsourced cloud infrastructure providers.\n              Additionally, we maintain contractual relationships with vendors in order to provide the Service in\n              accordance with our DPA. We rely on contractual agreements, privacy policies, and vendor compliance\n              programs in order to protect data processed or stored by these vendors.</p>\n          <p> Physical and environmental security: We host our product infrastructure with multi-tenant,\n              outsourced infrastructure providers. We do not own or maintain hardware located at the outsourced\n              infrastructure providers\u2019 data centers. Production servers and client-facing applications are\n              logically and physically secured from our internal corporate information systems. The physical and\n              environmental security controls are audited for SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance, among other\n              certifications.</p>\n          <p> Authentication: We implement a uniform password policy for our customer products. Customers who\n              interact with the products via the user interface must authenticate before accessing non-public\n              customer data.</p>\n          <p> Authorization: Customer Data is stored in multi-tenant storage systems accessible to Customers via\n              only application user interfaces and application programming interfaces. Customers are not allowed\n              direct access to the underlying application infrastructure. The authorization model in each of our\n              products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned individuals can access relevant\n              features, views, and customization options. Authorization to data sets is performed through\n              validating the user\u2019s permissions against the attributes associated with each data set.</p>\n          <p> Application Programming Interface (API) access: Public product APIs may be accessed using an API key\n              or through authorization.</p>\n          <p>ii) Preventing Unauthorized Product Use</p>\n          <p> We implement industry standard access controls and detection capabilities for the internal networks\n              that support its products.</p>\n          <p> Access controls: Network access control mechanisms are designed to prevent network traffic using\n              unauthorized protocols from reaching the product infrastructure. The technical measures implemented\n              differ between infrastructure providers and include Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) implementations,\n              security group assignment, and traditional firewall rules.</p>\n          <p> Intrusion detection and prevention: We implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution to\n              protect hosted customer websites and other internet-accessible applications. The WAF is designed to\n              identify and prevent attacks against publicly available network services.</p>\n          <p> Static code analysis: Code stored in our source code repositories is checked for best practices and\n              identifiable software flaws using automated tooling.</p>\n          <p>Penetration testing: We maintain relationships with industry-recognized penetration testing service\n              providers for penetration testing of both the CrmOne web application and internal corporate network\n              infrastructure at least annually. The intent of these penetration tests is to identify security\n              vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk and business impact they pose to the in-scope systems.</p>\n          <p>Bug bounty: A bug bounty program invites and incentives independent security researchers to ethically\n              discover and disclose security flaws. We implement a bug bounty program in an effort to widen the\n              available opportunities to engage with the security community and improve the product defenses\n              against sophisticated attacks.</p>\n          <p> iii) Limitations of Privilege &amp; Authorization Requirements</p>\n          <p> Product access: A subset of our employees have access to the products and to customer data via\n              controlled interfaces. The intent of providing access to a subset of employees is to provide\n              effective customer support, product development and research, to troubleshoot potential problems, to\n              detect and respond to security incidents and implement data security. Access is enabled through\n              \u201cjust in time\u201d (JITA) requests for access; all such requests are logged. Employees are granted\n              access by role, and reviews of high risk privilege grants are initiated daily. Administrative or\n              high risk access permissions are reviewed at least once every six months.</p>\n          <p> Background checks: Where permitted by applicable law, CrmOne employees undergo a third-party\n              background or reference checks. In the United States, employment offers are contingent upon the\n              results of a third-party background check. All CrmOne employees are required to conduct themselves\n              in a manner consistent with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical standards.\n          </p>\n          <p><strong> b) Transmission Control</strong></p>\n          <p> In-transit: We require HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS) on all login interfaces and\n              for free on every customer site hosted on the CrmOne products. Our HTTPS implementation uses\n              industry standard algorithms and certificates.</p>\n          <p> At-rest: We store user passwords following policies that follow industry standard practices for\n              security. We have implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest. </p>\n          <p><strong> c) Input Control</strong></p>\n          <p> Detection: We designed our infrastructure to log extensive information about the system behavior,\n              traffic received, system authentication, and other application requests. Internal systems aggregate\n              log data and alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous activities. Our\n              personnel, including security, operations, and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.\n          </p>\n          <p> Response and tracking: We maintain a record of known security incidents that includes description,\n              dates and times of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and confirmed security\n              incidents are investigated by security, operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution\n              steps are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents, we will take appropriate steps to\n              minimize product and Customer damage or unauthorized disclosure. Notification to you will be in\n              accordance with the terms of the Agreement. </p>\n          <p><strong> d) Availability Control</strong></p>\n          <p> Infrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use commercially reasonable efforts to\n              ensure a minimum of 99.95% uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to power,\n              network, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) services.</p>\n          <p> Fault tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure redundancy and fail-over\n              protections during a significant processing failure. Customer data is backed up to multiple durable\n              data stores and replicated across multiple availability zones.</p>\n          <p> Online replicas and backups: Where feasible, production databases are designed to replicate data\n              between no less than 1 primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and maintained\n              using at least industry standard methods.</p>\n          <p> Disaster Recovery Plans: We maintain and regularly test disaster recovery plans to help ensure\n              availability of information following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes.\n          </p>\n          <p>Our products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless fail over. The server instances that\n              support the products are also architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This\n              design assists our operations in maintaining and updating the product applications and back end\n              while limiting downtime.</p>\n  \n          <p id=\"datatab14\"> Annex 3 \u2013 Sub-Processors</p>\n          <p>To help CrmOne deliver the Subscription Service, we engage Sub-Processors to assist with our data\n              processing activities.

Spam can be in the form of bulk email or one to one\n              commercial emails.</p>\n          <p>Bulk email is spam when it is unsolicited. Unsolicited means the recipient has not granted verifiable\n              permission for the message to be sent. Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger\n              collection of messages that have substantively similar content.\n              One-to-one commercial emails are spam when they violate CAN-SPAM. One-to-one commercial emails are\n              also considered Spam if the data processed for purposes of sending that email is in scope of the\n              General Data Protection Regulation (\u2018GDPR\u2019) and you fail to provide notice to individuals and\n              establish a lawful basis of processing.\n          </p>\n          <p>You may not use the CrmOne Service in any way (directly or indirectly) to send, transmit, handle,\n              distribute or deliver: (a) spam in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act (referenced below) or any other\n              law; (b) email to an address obtained via Internet harvesting methods or any surreptitious methods\n              (e.g., scraping or harvesting); (c) email to an address that is incomplete, inaccurate and/or not\n              updated for all applicable opt-out notifications, using best efforts and best practices in the\n              industry, (d) commercial electronic messages in violation of Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Legislation\n              (referenced below), or (e) in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). </p>\n          <p>b. You may not use any misleading or false names, addresses, email address, or subject line. </p>\n          <p>Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the CrmOne Service may not: (a) use or contain invalid\n              or forged headers; (b) use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names; (c) employ any technique\n              to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the\n              transmission path; (d) use other means of deceptive addressing; (e) use a third party\u2019s internet\n              domain name without their consent, or be relayed from or through a third party\u2019s equipment without\n              the third party\u2019s permission; (f) contain false or misleading information in the subject line or\n              otherwise contain false or misleading content; or (g) use our trademark(s), tagline(s), or logo(s)\n              without our prior written consent and only then pursuant to our trademark usage guidelines.</p>\n          <p>If you use email, we recommend that you adopt the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working\n              Group Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP), which were created and agreed upon with\n              collaborative input from both volume email senders and Internet Service Providers. The Sender Best\n              Communications Practices document is available here. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to\n              follow these practices.</p>\n          <p>c. You may not email purchased lists. </p>\n          <p>You are prohibited from using the CrmOne Service to email: (a) purchased, rented, or borrowed lists,\n              and (b) lists that are likely to result in an excessive number of unsubscribe requests or Spam\n              complaints or notices, as determined by acceptable industry practices.</p>\n          <p id=\"usetab3\">3.

These\n              requirements may not apply if the email sent is a transactional email and these requirements are not\n              otherwise required by law. You warrant that you will promptly comply with all opt-out, unsubscribe,\n              \u201cdo not call\u201d and \u201cdo not send\u201d requests.</p>\n          <p id=\"usetab4\">4. Telephone, SMS, and Message Marketing</p>\n          <p>You must comply with all laws relating to telephone marketing, including without limitation those\n              specifically referenced in the \u2018Proper Usage of CrmOne Service\u2019 section below. You must comply with\n              all laws related to the recording of phone calls and ensure all proper consent to record is obtained\n              prior to making any such recording.

You\n              can learn more about how we access this data HERE or via in-app notice when you connect to Gmail.\n          \n          By using the Gmail integration with the Subscription Service you will grant the Subscription Service\n              access to information associated with your account, including contacts, emails, calendar,\n              distribution lists, subject lines, and URLs of tracked links from your email, if you use the email\n              tracking functionality. In addition, the Subscription Service will be able to read, modify, create,\n              and send emails from your connected Gmail account. The Subscription Service will scan the content of\n              your emails to identify which emails you have elected to track in order to provide you with the\n              notifications feature. The Subscription Service will store replies, outgoing mail, email headers,\n              subject line, distribution lists, aliases, time sent, and email bodies.

We may receive this data from our deal and lead the registration process through our\n              partners.\n          We may also collect information about you through our partner co-marketing partnerships.

For more information about our co-marketing program and how we share data with our partners\n              please see below and read about our co-marketing program under the channel partner policies.\n          Third Parties \n          We may receive information from third party service providers, from related companies, and from our\n              business and solution partners.\n          Personal Data from Different Sources\n          We may combine the personal information we collect from you with personal information we receive from\n              other sources, such as third party providers of business information and publicly available sources\n              (like social media platforms). This may include physical mail addresses, job titles, email\n              addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and social media profiles. This helps us to update and\n              improve our records, identify new customers, create more personalised advertising, suggest products\n              and services that may interest you, deliver personalised communications and promote events. The\n              collection of your Personal Data by these other third party providers is governed by the provider\u2019s\n              privacy policy.\n          Log Files \n          Like most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, we automatically collect and\n              store information about your computer hardware and software when you visit our websites, use our\n              product and services, or visit other sites or services that link to this Privacy Policy. This\n              information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, internet service provider\n              (ISP), and the files viewed on our websites (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), the files viewed on\n              our, or our customer\u2019s websites (if those websites are hosted on CrmOne e.g. HTML pages or, graphics\n              etc), your operating system, access times and referring website addresses. \n          When you use the Subscription Service, we collect and store the categories of information listed\n              above in logs in the following instances, subject to the customer\u2019s implementation settings:\n          \n              \n                  When a CrmOne user logs into their account and accesses tools in the CrmOne Platform;\n              \n              \n                  When an individual visits a customer\u2019s website, if the website is hosted by the CrmOne product;\n                  or\n              \n              \n                  When an individual visits a customer\u2019s website, if the customer\u2019s website is self-hosted, if the\n                  customer uses our plug-ins, and the customer uses CrmOne scripts and content (such as embedded\n                  forms).\n              \n          \n          Buttons, tools, and content from other companies\n          Our websites may include features and widgets (such as the share and/or \u201clike\u201d button or interactive\n              mini-programs) that run on our websites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you\n              are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These\n              features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. This\n              Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed\n              by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them. You can learn more about\n              data collected by Google and what this data is used for in Google\u2019s Privacy Policy.

How We Use Personal Data\n          a. To Communicate with You About the Product and Services\n          We use the account information you provide to CrmOne when signing up for the Subscription Service and\n              Trends services to send you transactional emails or in-app notification about billing, account\n              management, and other administrative matters. We may also send you updates regarding our Customer\n              Terms of Service or other legal agreements, and may also communicate with you about security\n              incidents via email or in-app notification. \n          We use your information to provide customer support, such as resolving technical issues you encounter\n              and analysing product outages or bugs.\n          If you use the CrmOne mobile applications, we may send you push notifications from time to time in\n              order to update you about events and promotions. If you no longer wish to receive such\n              communications, you may turn them off at the device level.\n          b. To Provide the Subscription Service\n          We use your account information and Customer Data to provide the product and services to you. For\n              example, we use the email address you provide when signing up for the product to create your user\n              account, and we use your payment information to process payments for paid use of the Subscription\n              Service. We also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer\n              support.\n          c. To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services\n          We collect usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services. We use this\n              data to develop and improve our products and services. For example, we use usage data to assess\n              trends and usage across the product to help us determine what new features or integrations our users\n              may be interested in. \n          We use Customer Data for machine learning that supports certain products and development of features\n              and functionality with the Subscription Service and similar products and services. For example,\n              machine learning helps power the business card scanner tool if you use our mobile apps and allows\n              for easier imports of data into your CrmOne account. You may opt-out of having your Customer Data\n              used for machine learning by emailing at connect@crmone.com \n          We may publish data about how our product and services are being used across our customer base. When\n              we share statistical information externally in this way, the data will be aggregated and we will not\n              identify individual users or customers. For example, we may publish blog posts on trends or insights\n              into how users are interacting with our product. \n          d. To Secure and Protect our Product and CrmOne Users\n          We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents. We may also use\n              this information to meet legal requirements. We use your information to verify user accounts, new\n              product sign-ups, and to detect and prevent product abuse. This includes enforcing our Customer\n              Terms of Service..\n          We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how\n              you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and\n              regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also\n              collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns,\n              investigate security events and incidents. For these purposes we do link this\n              automatically-collected data to other personal data provided by you such as name, email address,\n              address, and phone number. \n          e. To Market and Promote the Subscription Service\n          We use the information you provide to CrmOne to market and promote the products, services, and other\n              offerings. For example, we use the information, like your email or physical address, to send\n              information or CrmOne content to you which we think may be of interest to you by post, email, or\n              other means and send you marketing communications relating to our business.\n          You may opt out of receiving this promotional content by following the instructions contained in each\n              communication that we send to you or by contacting us connect@crmone.com. If you unsubscribe from\n              our marketing lists, we will continue to contact you regarding administrative matters, and to\n              respond to your requests.\n          We may also reach out to you via telephone to ask about other CrmOne products or services you may be\n              interested in. If you have a call scheduled with a CrmOne representative, we may record and\n              transcribe the call. You will be notified prior to the call that the call is being recorded, and you\n              will be offered an opportunity to opt-out of having the call recorded.\n          Where required by law, we will only send marketing communications with your consent. Otherwise, we\n              will market and advertise our products and services on the basis of our legitimate business\n              interests.\n          We receive information from third party service providers and other sources such as third party\n              providers of business information and publicly available sources. We may receive and use this\n              information from these service providers and other sources in combination with other information we\n              collect through other means described in this Privacy Policy for the purposes of providing you with\n              updates and an improved Subscription Service, like personalised communications, event promotion, and\n              tailoring the websites or product to improve user experience.\n          f. Other purposes if we obtain your consent\n          We share your data with third parties when you give us consent to do so.\n          g. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (EEA and UK visitors only) \n          If you are a website visitor located in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d),\n              CrmOne Ireland Limited is the data controller of your Personal Data. CrmOne\u2019s Data Protection\n              Officer can be contacted Customer Terms of Service.\n          Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the\n              Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally\n              collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal\n              Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not\n              overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we\n              may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.\n          If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract\n              with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your\n              Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide\n              your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our\n              legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time\n              what those legitimate interests are.\n          3. How We Share Personal Data\n          a. Service Providers \n          We may share Personal Data with our third party service providers to support our websites, products,\n              and services. For example, we use service providers for data hosting, application development,\n              marketing, sales support and customer support. We may need to share your information with service\n              providers to provide information about products or services to you. Examples may include removing\n              repetitive information from prospect lists, analysing data or performing statistical analysis on\n              your use of the Subscription Service or interactions on our websites, providing marketing\n              assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order\n              to provide you with better service, developing and improving the product and services, and providing\n              customer service or support. These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Data\n              except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your\n              information. In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the\n              third party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies\n              and standards.\n          b. Partners \n          We may share data with trusted CrmOne partners to contact you based on your request to receive such\n              communications, help us perform statistical analysis, provide sales support, or provide customer\n              support. Partners are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they\n              are required to maintain the confidentiality of your data.\n          We also partner with trusted third parties to provide you with co-marketing content that we think may\n              be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners, we will tell you who we are\n              sharing data with, and provide a link to the co-marketing partner\u2019s privacy policy so you can learn\n              more about how to opt-out of the partner\u2019s communications. These co-marketing partners are required\n              to adhere to our privacy and data protection policies. \n          c. Corporate Events \n          If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or\n              otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by CrmOne on the websites and the\n              Subscription Service. In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our\n              website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding\n              your Personal Data.\n          d. Public Forums\n          Our websites may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums (e.g. CrmOne\n              Community and Connect.com). Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information\n              through our public message boards, blogs, or forums (including profile information associated with\n              the account you use to post the information) it may be read, collected and used by any member of the\n              public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after\n              you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you may\n              disclose in this way. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the websites if\n              you so request, as described in Section 7 \u201cYour Privacy Rights and Choices\u201d below. In some cases, we\n              may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to\n              and why.\n          e. Compelled Disclosure\n          We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably\n              believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety\n              of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process. If you use the\n              Subscription Service, Customer Data is considered Confidential Information and you should review the\n              Confidentiality terms in the Customer Terms of Service for more information.

International Transfers within the CrmOne Group\n          To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer information to other CrmOne Affiliates where we\n              have operations for the purposes described in this policy. Please see Customer Terms of Service for\n              a list of CrmOne Affiliates and their locations. \n          This Privacy Policy will apply even if we transfer Personal Data to other countries. We have taken\n              appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected wherever it is\n              transferred. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d),\n              Switzerland or the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) within and among CrmOne\u2019s Affiliates, we make use of the\n              EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy\n              Framework (collectively, the \u201cData Privacy Framework\u201d).

For example, you may provide Input into an AI\n              Product such as \u201cWhat color is the sky?\u201d and receive responses such as \u201cThe sky is blue.\u201d These\n              responses are not unique to you and you may not claim ownership in them.\n          5.3 Availability and Modifications\n          We do not guarantee the availability of the AI Products in any or all geographical areas.\n              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any production downtime impacting the AI\n              Products that results from a failure of a third party service provider will not be included in the\n              Service Uptime Commitment.\n          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in our Terms of Service or these Product Specific Terms, we\n              may make changes to the AI Products that materially reduce the functionality provided to you during\n              the Subscription Term or change the limits that apply to you at any time in our sole discretion.\n          \n          6. SERVICE UPTIME COMMITMENT\n          6.1 For the purposes of this \u2018Service Uptime Commitment\u2019 section, the following definitions will\n              apply:\n          \u201cDowntime\u201d means a critical full outage/severe issue that constitutes a catastrophic problem causing\n              complete inability to use the Subscription Service, excluding Free Services, across a significant\n              portion of the production environment (e.g. crash or hang), resulting in production downtime and\n              where there is no workaround or solution to the problem.\n          \u201cExcluded\u201d means the following: (i) unavailability caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable\n              control, including, without limitation, act of God, acts of government, emergencies, natural\n              disasters, flood, fire, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems (other than\n              those involving our employees), or any other force majeure event or factors; (ii) any problems\n              resulting from Customer\u2019s combining or merging the Subscription Service with any hardware or\n              software not supplied by us or not identified by us in writing as compatible with the Subscription\n              Service; (iii) interruptions or delays in providing the Subscription Service resulting from\n              telecommunications or internet service provider failures outside of our datacenter as measured by\n              our third party website availability monitoring provider; (iv) any interruption or unavailability\n              resulting from the misuse, improper use, alteration, or damage of the Subscription Service; and (v)\n              unavailability while we perform maintenance on the Subscription Service when necessary, in CrmOne\u2019s\n              sole, reasonable discretion.\n          \u201cService Uptime\u201d means (total hours in calendar month \u2013 Excluded duration \u2013 Downtime duration) /\n              (total hours in calendar month \u2013 Excluded duration ) x 100% = Service Uptime.\n          6.2 We will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet a Service Uptime of 96% for our Subscription\n              Service in a given calendar month. All availability calculations will be based on our system\n              records. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, as Customer\u2019s sole and\n              exclusive remedy for failure to meet Service Uptime commitments, in the event there are two (2) or\n              more consecutive calendar months during which the Service Uptime falls below 96% in a given calendar\n              month, Customer will be entitled to receive a credit equal to the pro-rated amount of fees\n              applicable to the downtime as measured within two (2) or more consecutive calendar months during\n              which the Service Uptime fell below 96%. The credit will be applied against an invoice or charge for\n              the following renewal Subscription Term, provided Customer requests such credit within twenty (20)\n              days of the end of the relevant calendar month in which CrmOne did not meet the Service Uptime of\n              96%. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or this section, this \u2018Service Uptime\n              Commitment\u2019 section does not apply to our Free Services.\n          7.

We attempt to respond to email within one business\n              day; in practice, our responses are generally even faster. We do not promise or guarantee any\n              specific response time. We may limit or deny your access to support if we determine, in our\n              reasonable discretion, that you are acting, or have acted, in a way that results or has resulted in\n              misuse of support or abuse of CrmOne representatives. \n          7.2 Phone Support\n          Phone support for Professional or Enterprise edition subscriptions is available from 9 am Monday to 9\n              pm everyday IST (Indian Standard Time).

It explains what these technologies are and why we use\n              them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.\n          What are cookies?\n          A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you\n              visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your\n              browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information.\n          Cookies provide a convenience feature to save you time, or tell the Web server that you have returned\n              to a specific page. \n          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, CrmOne) are called \u201cfirst party cookies\u201d. Cookies set\n              by parties other than the website owner are called \u201cthird party cookies\u201d. Third party cookies enable\n              third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like\n              advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can\n              recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain\n              other websites. \n          Why do we use cookies?\n          We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for\n              technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as \u201cessential\u201d or\n              \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our\n              users to enhance the experience on our Websites and Subscription Service. For example, CrmOne keeps\n              track of the Websites and pages you visit within CrmOne, in order to determine what portion of the\n              CrmOne Website or Subscription Service is the most popular or most used. This data is used to\n              deliver customized content and promotions within the CrmOne Website and Subscription Service to\n              customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Third\n              parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising,\n          Analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.\n          What types of cookies do we use and how do we use them?\n          The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they\n              perform. These cookies include:\n          \n              \n                  Essential website cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services\n                  available through our Websites.\n              \n              \n                  Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies are used to enhance the performance and\n                  functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use. However, without these\n                  cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.\n              \n              \n                  Analytics and customization cookies: These cookies collect information that is used either in\n                  aggregate form to help us understand how our Websites are being used or how effective our\n                  marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Websites for you.\n              \n              \n                  Advertising cookies: These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.\n                  They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that\n                  ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are\n                  based on your interests.\n              \n              \n                  Social networking cookies: These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that\n                  you find interesting on our Websites through third party social networking and other websites.\n                  These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.\n              \n  \n          \n          How can I control cookies?\n          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.

Please\n              note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic\n              advertisements.\n          Essential website cookies: Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Websites to\n              you, you cannot refuse them. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings however,\n              as described above.\n  \n          What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?\n          Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website that help us better manage\n              the Website and Subscription Service by informing us what content is effective. They are tiny\n              graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online\n              movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive,\n              are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of\n              this sentence. We use or pixels in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been\n              opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the\n              effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by in emails to our\n              customers\u2019 Personal Information.\n  \n          Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?\n          The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences\n              and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the\n              one provided by your Web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often\n              referred to as \u201cFlash cookies.\u201d CrmOne does not use Flash cookies. However, our customers of our\n              software platform may create pages on the CrmOne platform that employ Adobe Flash cookies. CrmOne\n              does not have access or control over our customers\u2019 Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash\n              management tools from Adobe\u2019s website directly here.\n          Similarly, our customers may create pages using the CrmOne Subscription Service that use technology\n              from tracking utility companies. The use of these technologies by our customers is not covered by\n              our Cookie Policy or Privacy Notice. We do not have control over third party cookies or trackers our\n              customers use.\n          Do you serve targeted advertising?\n          Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our\n              Websites. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order\n              to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may\n              also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be\n              accomplished by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and\n              other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential\n              interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to\n              identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to\n              provide these.\n          How often will you update this Cookie Policy?\n          We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the\n              cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

The regulation builds on many of the 1995 Directive\u2019s requirements\n              for data privacy and security, but includes several new provisions to bolster the rights of data\n              subjects and add harsher penalties for violations. The regulate came into effect on May 25th, 2018.\n          \n          What was the story before the GDPR?\n          \n              You\u2019ve likely heard a lot about the GDPR in 2018, but did you know we\u2019ve had data protection\n              legislation in the EU for quite a while already? Although the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive was\n              replaced by the GPDR in May 2018, the Directive sets out the eight data protection principles which\n              have been governing the treatment of personal data by\u00a0organizations\u00a0for over two decades!\n          \n          Does the GDPR apply to me?\n          \n              The GDPR applies to businesses that a) market their products to people in the EU or who b) monitor\n              the behavior of people in the EU. In other words, even if you\u2019re based outside of the EU but you\n              control or process the data of EU citizens, the GDPR will apply to you.\n          \n          \n              Disclaimer:\u00a0 This website is neither a magnum opus on EU data privacy nor legal\n              advice for your\n              company to use in complying with EU data privacy laws like the GDPR. Instead, it provides background\n              information to help you better understand how CrmOne has addressed some important legal points. This\n              legal information is not the same as legal advice, where an attorney applies the law to your\n              specific circumstances, so we insist that you consult an attorney if you\u2019d like advice on your\n              interpretation of this information or its accuracy. In a nutshell, you may not rely on this paper as\n              legal advice, nor as a recommendation of any particular legal understanding.\n          \n          Important components of the GDPR\n          \n              Individual\u2019s Rights\n              Internal Procedures\n              Supervisory Authorities\n              Scope, Accountability and Penalties\n          \n          Consent\u00a0\n          The GDPR steps up the standard for disclosures when obtaining consent, as it needs to be \u201cfreely\n              given, specific, informed and unambiguous,\u201d with controllers using \u201cclear and plain\u201d legal language\n              that is \u201cclearly distinguishable from other matters\u201d. Controllers will also be required to provide\n              evidence that their processes are compliant and followed in each case.\n          Essentially, your customer cannot be forced into consent, or be unaware that they are consenting to\n              processing of their personal data. They must also know exactly what they are consenting to and they\n              must be informed in advance of their right to withdraw that consent. Obtaining consent requires a\n              positive indication of agreement \u2013 it cannot be inferred from silence, pre-ticked boxes or\n              inactivity. This means that informing the user during the opt-in is becoming more important.\n          New Rights for Individuals\n          The regulation also builds in two new rights for data subjects: a \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d\u00a0that\n              requires controllers to alert downstream recipients of deletion requests and a \u201cright to data\n              portability\u201d\u00a0that allows data subjects to demand a copy of their data in a common format. These two\n              rights make it easier for users to request that any information stored should be deleted or that\n              information that has been collected should be shared with them.\n          Access Requests\n          Data subjects always had a right to request access to their data. But the GDPR enhances these rights.\n              In most cases, you will not be able to charge for processing an access request, unless you can\n              demonstrate that the cost will be excessive. The timescale for processing an access request will\n              also drop to a one month period but this can be extended a further two months in some circumstances.\n              In certain cases, organizations may refuse to grant an access request, for example where the request\n              is deemed manifestly unfounded or excessive. However, organizations will need to have clear refusal\n              policies and procedures in place, and demonstrate why the request meets these criteria.\n          Privacy by Design and DPIA\n          There are several new principles for entities that handle personal data, including a requirement to\n              build in data privacy\u00a0\u201cby design\u201d\u00a0when developing new systems and an obligation to perform a Data\n              Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) when processing using\u00a0\u201cnew technologies\u201d\u00a0or in risky ways. A DPIA\n              is the process of systematically considering the potential impact that a project or initiative might\n              have on the privacy of individuals so that potential privacy issues can be identified before they\n              arise, giving the organization time to come up with a way to mitigate them before the project is\n              underway.\n          Data Privacy Officer\n          On the security side, the GDPR requires many businesses to have a Data Privacy Officer (DPO) to help\n              oversee their compliance efforts. Organizations requiring DPOs include public authorities,\n              organizations whose activities involve the regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a\n              large scale, or organizations who process sensitive personal data on a large scale.\u00a0\u00a0\n          Contracts & Privacy Documentation\n          Since the GDPR is all about transparency and fairness, Controllers and Processors need to review\n              their Privacy Notices, Privacy Statements, and any internal data policies to ensure they meet the\n              requirements under the GDPR. If a Controller engages third party vendors to process the personal\n              data under their control, they need to ensure their contracts with those Processors are updated to\n              include the new, mandatory Processor provisions set out in Article 28 of the Regulation. Similarly,\n              Processors should consider what changes they\u2019ll need to make to their customer contracts to be GDPR\n              compliant.\n          One-Stop Shop\n          One particular item in the GDPR should serve to make the lives of these Data Protection Officers\n              easier: the GDPR\u2019s new\u00a0\u201cone stop shop\u201d\u00a0provision, under which organizations with offices in multiple\n              EU countries will have a\u00a0\u201clead supervisory authority\u201d\u00a0to act as a central point of enforcement so\n              they don\u2019t struggle with inconsistent directions from multiple supervisory authorities.\n          Reporting Breaches\n          The GDPR contains a requirement that controllers must notify their country\u2019s supervisory authority of\n              a personal data breach within 72 hours of learning of it unless the data was anonymize or encrypted.\n              In practice, this will mean that most data breaches must be reported to the Data Protection\n              Commissioner. \u00a0Breaches that are likely to bring harm to an individual \u2013 such as identity theft or\n              breach of confidentiality \u2013 must also be reported to the individuals concerned.\n          Scope\n          The GDPR applies to non-EU businesses who market their products to people in the EU or who monitor\n              the behavior of people in the EU. In other words, even if you\u2019re based outside of the EU but you\n              control or process the data of EU citizens, the GDPR\u00a0likely applies to you.\n          Accountability\n          This concept requires Controllers and Processors to be able to demonstrate their compliance with the\n              GDPR to their local supervisory authority. Processes should be recorded, implemented and reviewed on\n              a regular basis. Staff should be trained and appropriate technical and organizational measures\n              should be taken to ensure and demonstrate compliance.\n          Severe Penalties\n          The importance of the GDPR\u2019s new provisions is underscored by the new penalties it imposes for\n              violations. Depending on the type of violation in question, controllers and processors who mishandle\n              personal data or otherwise violate data subjects\u2019 rights could incur fines of up to \u20ac20 million or\n              4% of their global annual turnover\u00a0(whichever is greater).\n          If you\u2019re already a CrmOne customer or partner, please contact your account manager if you have any\n              further questions, comments or suggestions.\n          What did the law say before the GDPR?\n          Although the DPD was replaced by the GPDR, it sets out the eight data protection principles which the\n              GDPR builds on. These rules govern how organizations should treat personal data and are set out\n              below:\n          Obtain and process the personal data fairly\n          Keep it only for one or more specified and lawful purposes\n          Process it only in ways compatible with the purposes for which it was given to you initially\n          Keep it safe and secure\n          Keep it accurate and up-to-date\n          Ensure that it is adequate, relevant and not excessive\n          Retain it no longer than is necessary for the specified purpose or purposes\n          Give a copy of his/her personal data to any individual, on request.\n          The DPD\u00a0was a Directive, which is a legislative act that sets out a goal that all EU countries must\n              achieve. However, it is up to the individual countries to devise their own laws on how to reach\n              these goals. In Ireland for example, the goals of the DPD were implemented through the Irish Data\n              Protection Act, 1998.\n          A Regulation on the other hand, such as the GDPR, is a binding legislative act which applies in its\n              entirety across the EU.\u00a0\n          Is double-opt-in mandatory?\n          For those unfamiliar with the term, \u201cdouble-opt-in\u201d is a 2-step mechanism where a person must confirm\n              their email address after initially signing up. The GDPR does not require double-opt-in (though\n              certain countries may make this mandatory).\n          It\u2019s worth noting that subscribers to the CrmOne service may already choose to enable double-opt-in\n              functionality in their portals as an additional protective measure in proving they obtained the\n              required consent.\n          How will Brexit impact the compliance for businesses based in the UK?\n          In June 2016, a majority of UK voters voted in favour of leaving the EU in the\u00a0\u201cBrexit\u201d\u00a0referendum.\n              In March 2017, Theresa May gave notice to leave the EU under Art. 50 which triggered the\n              commencement of the Brexit negotiations.\u00a0This regulator resource may be helpful as the terms of\n              Brexit morph over time:\n          If you\u2019re based outside the UK but have vendors or affiliates in the UK with whom you share personal\n              data, you\u2019ll also need to keep an eye on developments in this area. When the UK leaves, cross-border\n              data flows may not automatically have adequate safeguards\u00a0and therefore additional projections may\n              be required to protect data you transfer to the UK.\n          How are the Rights of Individuals affected by the GDPR?\n          Individuals already\u00a0had a lot of rights which protected their personal data under the 1995 Data\n              Protection Directive, but the GDPR significantly strengthened these rights such that data subjects\n              can now:\n          obtain details about how their data is processed by an organization or business;\n          obtain copies of personal data that an organization holds on them;\n          have incorrect or incomplete data corrected;\n          have their data erased by an organization, where, for example, the organization has no legitimate\n              reason for retaining the data;\n          obtain their data from an organization and to have that data transmitted to another organization\n              (Data Portability);\n          object to the processing of their data by an organization in certain circumstances;\n          not to be subject to (with some exceptions) automated decision making, including profiling.\n          Does EU data now have to be stored in the EU?\n          No. There is no obligation under the GDPR for data to be stored in the EU and the rules regarding\n              transfer of personal data outside the EU will not change. This means that, as long as the personal\n              data is\u00a0\u201cadequately protected\u201d, data may be transferred abroad. For example, the EU has prepared a\n              list of countries which they deem to provide an adequate standard of protection (known as\u00a0\u201cwhite\n              listed countries\u201d), so it is permissible to transfer data to those countries. Where a country is not\n              on that EU list (for example, the USA), the controller must rely on use of approved contractual\n              provisions (e.g. the Model Clauses or Corporate Binding Rules) or one of the other alternative\n              measures, provided for in Law, such as the Privacy Shield certification.\n          Where can I find additional resources?\n          We\u2019ve compiled a list of additional sites for more information around the new regulation down below.\n              Please feel free to check them out.\u00a0\n          The Irish Data Protection Commissioner\u2019s GDPR\n          Guidance from the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protections\u2019 on the GDPR\n          EU Data Protection Supervisor\n          Find your Supervisory Authority\n          Full text of the GDPR\n          Full text of the GDPR in German\n          The EU\u2019s GDPR\n          The UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office\n          Are you GDPR ready?\n          Read through our checklist to find out more.\n          Since every business is different and the GDPR takes a risk-based approach to data protection,\n              companies should work to\u00a0assess their own data collection and storage practices\u00a0(including the ways\n              they use CrmOne\u2019s marketing and sales tools), seek their own legal advice to ensure that their\n              business practices\u00a0comply with the GDPR.\u00a0In determining your next steps, here are some of the\n              questions you should consider.\u00a0\n          The Assessment\n          What personal data do we collect/store?\n          Have we obtained it fairly? Do we have the necessary consents required and were the data subjects\n              informed of the specific purpose for which we\u2019ll use their data? Were we clear and unambiguous about\n              that purpose and were they informed of their right to withdraw consent at any time?\n          Are we ensuring we aren\u2019t holding it for any longer than is necessary and keeping it up-to-date?\n          Are we keeping it safe and secure using a level of security appropriate to the risk? For example,\n              will encryption or pseudonymisation be required to protect the personal data we hold? \u00a0Are we\n              limiting access to ensure it is only being used for its intended purpose?\n          Are we collecting or processing any special categories of personal data, such as \u2018Sensitive Personal\n              Data\u2019, children\u2019s data, biometric or genetic data etc. and if so, are we meeting the standards to\n              collect, process and store it?\n          Are we transferring the personal data outside the EU and if so, do we have adequate protections in\n              place?\n          The GDPR Project Plan\n          Have we put a project plan together to ensure compliance by the May 2018 deadline?\n          Have we secured buy-in at executive level to ensure we have the required resources and budget on hand\n              to move the project forward?\n          Do we require a Data Privacy Impact Assessment?\n          Do we need to hire a Data Privacy Officer?\n          Are we implementing a policy of \u2018Data Protection by Design and Default\u2019 to ensure we\u2019re\n              systematically considering the potential impact that a project or initiative might have on the\n              privacy of individuals?\n          Have we considered how we handle employee data in our plan?\n          The Procedures and Controls\n          Are our Security team informed to ensure they\u2019re aware of their obligations under the GDPR and do\n              they have sufficient resources to implement any required changes or new processes?\n          Do we have procedures in place to handle requests from data subjects to modify, delete or access\n              their personal data? Do these procedures comply the new rules under the GDPR?\n          Do we have security notification procedures in place to ensure we meet our enhanced reporting\n              obligations under the GDPR in case of a data breach in a timely manner?\n          Are our staff trained in all areas of EU data privacy to ensure they handle data in a compliant\n              manner?\n          Do we review and audit the data we hold on a regular basis?\n          The Documentation\n          Do we have a Privacy Policy in place and if so, do we need to update it to comply with the GDPR?\n          Do we have a defined policy on retention periods for all items of personal data, from customer,\n              prospect and vendor data to employee data? Is it compliant with the GDPR?\n          Are our internal procedures adequately documented?\n          If we\u2019re a data processor, have we updated our contracts with the relevant controllers to ensure they\n              include the mandatory provisions set out in Art. 28 of the GDPR?\n          In cases where our third party vendors are processing personal data on our behalf, have we ensured\n              our contracts with them have been updated to include those same processor requirements under the\n              GDPR?\n          Disclaimer\n          This legal information is not the same as legal advice, where an attorney applies the law to your\n              specific circumstances, so we insist that you consult an attorney if you\u2019d like advice on your\n              interpretation of this information or its accuracy. In a nutshell, you may not rely on this paper as\n              legal advice, nor as a recommendation of any particular legal understanding.\n          Personal data\n          Any information related to a person or contact, for example: name, national ID number, address, IP\n              address, etc. This type of information is also known as personally identifiable information (PII).\n          \n          General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n          A European Union (EU) law that protects the personal data of EU and European Economic Area citizens\n              and residents. It outlines requirements necessary for both EU businesses and any business that\n              collects or processes this personal data. Similar requirements can also be found in many national\n              data privacy laws outside of the EU.\n          Controller\n          A business or person that decides why and how to process data about a person. One example is a\n              business owner serving as a Controller over its data stored in CrmOne, where the business makes\n              decisions about how to use the data. Note: A business or person can be both a controller and a\n              processor at the same time.\n          Processor\n          A business or person that processes data. They process the data as instructed, but don\u2019t have control\n              over how or why it\u2019s processed. For example, CrmOne is a processor for a business owner when CrmOne\n              stores and processes data based on the business owner\u2019s instructions. Note: A business or person can\n              be both a controller and a processor at the same time.\n          Processing (data processing)\n          Any action performed on personal data. This can be automated or manual. Examples include: collecting,\n              organizing, recording, storing, or deleting data.\n          Consent\n          Giving permission to use or share data. This could be done via opting-in or can be implied.\n          Under the GDPR and similar data privacy laws, consent must be freely given, specific, informed and\n              unambiguous. Consent must be positive and affirmative, and in some cases it must be explicitly\n              given.\n          Affirmative or explicit consent\n          When a person communicates clear approval and agreement to process their data. For example,\n              responding \u201cYes\u201d to receiving text messages from a business.\n          Implicit consent\n          When consent can reasonably be assumed from a person\u2019s action or inaction. For example, when a\n              customer buys a product from a business, their personal data would be processed in order to ship the\n              product, to provide customer support, etc.\n          Consent to process (data)\n          When a contact has agreed to the collecting, storing, sending, etc. of their data, also known as\n              processing data. Under the GDPR and other privacy laws, this permission must be \u201cfreely given,\n              specific, informed and unambiguous.\u201d\n          Consent to communicate\n          When a contact has given permission to be contacted or receive communication. For example, via SMS,\n              email, etc.\n          Double opt in\n          A type of consent that requires two separate positive actions. For example, to double-opt-in to\n              receive marketing emails would mean first signing up for the emails, then clicking on a separate\n              email confirmation link. \n  \n      \n\n      .\n\n          App Partner Program\n          PLEASE READ THIS APP PARTNER PROGRAM AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.\n          This is a contract between you (the Company) and us (CrmOne).

Partner\n              Representatives understand that they may be found to be in violation of applicable laws if they take\n              advantage of such information. If Partner Representatives are exposed to such material, nonpublic\n              information, Partner Representatives agree not to: (1) trade in CrmOne\u2019s securities (including\n              common stock, stock options, other CrmOne-issued securities, or derivative securities), (2) have\n              others trade in CrmOne\u2019s securities on the Partner Representative\u2019s behalf, (3) give trading advice\n              of any kind about CrmOne, (4) disclose any material, nonpublic information to anyone else who might\n              then trade, or (5) recommend to anyone that they purchase or sell CrmOne\u2019s securities.

You are not eligible to receive Commission or\n                  any other compensation from us based on transactions for Other Products or if: (i) such\n                  compensation is disallowed or limited by federal, state or local law or regulation in the United\n                  States or the laws or regulations of your jurisdiction; (ii) the applicable Customer objects to\n                  or prohibits such compensation or excludes such compensation from its payments to us or CrmOne\n                  Affiliates; (iii) the Customer has paid or will pay such commissions, referral fees, or other\n                  compensation directly to you, (iv) the Commission payment has been obtained by fraudulent means,\n                  misuse of the Affiliate Link, in violation of any Affiliate Program Policies that we make\n                  available to you, misuse of the Affiliate Tool or by any other means that we deem to breach the\n                  spirit of the Affiliate Program, or (v) the Customer participates in any of our partner\n                  programs, including our Agency Partner Program, Sales Referral Partner Program or Sales\n                  Solutions Partner Program and is eligible to receive commission in relation to the Customer\n                  Transaction under any of these programs. If at any point you are eligible to receive a revenue\n                  share payment or commission under another Program at CrmOne, that payment amount will not change\n                  based on your participation in the Affiliate Program. For example, you will not be able to\n                  receive the Commission set out in this Agreement on any Partner Transaction that was completed\n                  whilst participating as a partner in the Solutions Partner Program (as defined in the Solutions\n                  Partner Program Agreement). In competitive situations with other affiliates, we may elect to\n                  provide the Commission to the affiliate that we deem to be the most eligible for Commission, at\n                  our discretion. We may discontinue Commission payments should any of the eligibility criteria\n                  set forth in this subsection fail to be met at any time. \n              Acceptance and Validity. You will only be eligible for a Commission payment for any Customer\n                  Transactions that derived from Affiliate Leads generated by the Affiliate Link that we make\n                  available to you and are accepted by CrmOne. An Affiliate Lead will be considered valid and\n                  accepted if, in our reasonable determination: (i) it is a new potential customer of ours, and\n                  (ii) is not, at the time of submission or sixty (60) days prior, one of our pre-existing\n                  customers, or involved in our active sales process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may choose\n                  not to accept an Affiliate Lead in our reasonable discretion. If an Affiliate Lead does not\n                  purchase the Subscription Service within the time period described on the Affiliate Tool (or if\n                  applicable, in the Program Policies) of their first click on the Affiliate Link, you will not be\n                  eligible for a Commission payment, even if the Affiliate Lead decides to purchase after the time\n                  period has expired. An Affiliate Lead is not considered valid if its first click on the\n                  Affiliate Link is after this Agreement has expired or terminated. Engagement with Prospects.\n                  Once we have received the Affiliate Lead information, we may elect to engage with the prospect\n                  directly, regardless of whether or not the Affiliate Lead is valid. If an Affiliate Lead is not\n                  valid then we may choose to maintain it in our database and we may choose to engage with such\n                  Affiliate Lead. Any engagement between CrmOne and an Affiliate Lead will be at CrmOne\u2019s\n                  discretion.\n              Commission and Payment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary\n                  in this Agreement, if any of the requirements set forth in section 4(a)(i-iv) remain outstanding\n                  for six (6) months immediately following the close of a Customer Transaction, then your right to\n                  receive Commission arising from any and all Customer Transactions with the associated Customer\n                  will be forever forfeited (each, a \u201cForfeited Transaction\u201d). We will have no obligation to pay\n                  you the Commission associated with a Forfeited Transaction. Once you comply with all of the\n                  requirements in section 5(a)(i-iv), then you will be eligible to receive Commission on Customer\n                  Transactions, as long as these Customer Transactions do not involve the same Customer associated\n                  with a Forfeited Transaction.\n              Commission Payment. We or the Affiliate Tool will determine the currency in which we pay the\n                  Commission, as well as the applicable conversion rate. We will not pay more than one Commission\n                  payment or other similar referral fee on any given Customer Transaction (unless we choose to in\n                  our discretion). Taxes. You are responsible for payment of all taxes and fees (including bank\n                  fees) applicable to the Commission. All amounts payable by us to you are subject to offset by us\n                  against any amounts owed by you to us. Commission Amounts. We reserve the right to alter or\n                  change the Commission amount as per the Affiliate Tool. \n          \n          Training and Support\n          We may make available to you, without charge, various webinars and other resources made available as\n              part of our Affiliate Program. If we make such resources available to you, you will encourage your\n              sales representatives and/or other relevant personnel to participate in training and/or other\n              certifications as we recommend and may make available to you from time-to-time. We may change or\n              discontinue any or all parts of the Affiliate Program benefits or offerings at any time without\n              notice.\n          Trademarks\n          You grant to us a nonexclusive, non transferable, royalty-free right to use and display your\n              trademarks, service marks and logos (\u201cAffiliate Marks\u201d) in connection with the Affiliate Program and\n              this Agreement.\n          During the term of this Agreement, in the event that we make our trademark available to you within\n              the Affiliate Tool, you may use our trademark as long as you follow the usage requirements in this\n              section.

If you are paying by invoice, we will invoice you before the beginning\n              of the Subscription Term and each subsequent Billing Period, and other times during the Subscription\n              Term when fees are payable.

All payment obligations are non-cancel able and\n              all amounts paid are non-refundable, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement.

We will not suspend the Subscription Service while you are disputing the applicable charges\n              reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. \n          4.5.3 Suspension for Present Harm\n          If your website, or use of, the Subscription Service: \n          (i) is being subjected to denial of service attacks or other disruptive activity, \n          (ii) is being used to engage in denial of service attacks or other disruptive activity, \n          (iii) is creating a security vulnerability for the Subscription Service or others, \n          (iv) is consuming excessive bandwidth or storage, or \n          (v) is causing harm to us or others, then we may, with electronic or telephonic notice to you,\n              suspend all or any access to the Subscription Service. \n          We will make commercially reasonable efforts to limit the suspension to the affected portion of the\n              Subscription Service, and each party will make reasonable efforts to promptly resolve the issues\n              causing the suspension of the Subscription Service.

Injunctive Relief.\n          You acknowledge that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Content or any Developer Credentials\n              may cause irreparable harm to us or our customers. Accordingly, you agree that we will have the\n              right to obtain an immediate injunction against any breach or threatened breach of these Terms, as\n              well as the right to pursue any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity for\n              such a breach.\n          Content Moderation CrmOne\n          Our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) prohibits use of the CrmOne Service with content or in a manner that\n              promotes, encourages, or facilitates: illegal activity, hate speech, violence, or discrimination\n              based on race, color, religion or creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, age, physical or mental\n              disability, veteran status, genetic information and citizenship. In April 2020, we updated our AUP\n              to add sexual orientation, marital status, gender or identity expression and parental status and\n              any/or other characteristics protected by law; we clarified that organizations or individuals who\n              promote, encourage, or facilitate hate speech, violence, or discrimination, either through their own\n              content or through distribution of user generated content, are prohibited from using the CrmOne\n              Service, regardless of whether the CrmOne Service is used specifically for the prohibited\n              activities. \n          We rely on our content moderation program to help us identify, review, and take action when CrmOne\n              users violate these restrictions in our AUP. As part of this program, we\u2019ve developed an internal\n              content policy and guidelines to help us ensure we\u2019re enforcing our AUP equitably and uniformly\n              across our entire customer base. We\u2019ve also formed a multi-member Content Review Committee (CRC)\n              composed of diverse leaders from different parts and locations of CrmOne, which is responsible for\n              reviewing reports about CrmOne users who engage in these activities, and determining what actions to\n              take. \n          The CrmOne content moderation program is intended to help us make decisions about certain users of\n              our platform and the content we will allow (and not allow). It also helps us live up to our core\n              values and principles as a company. It does not supplant the AUP or address other violations of the\n              AUP \u2013 for example, we will still take action against illegal content, spammers, those abusing our\n              platform, pornography, etc. under separate processes and guidelines.\n          Complaints regarding CrmOne users may be provided by our employees, our customers or partners, or by\n              anyone from the public. You may report content violations to us by sending an email to connect@crmone.com.\n      \n\n      \n          Developer Terms & Conditions\n          Thank you for choosing to develop on the CrmOne platform.

This detail should be\n                  included in an easily accessible privacy policy which explains to Customers how their data will\n                  be collected, used, and processed and what control Users have over their data.\n              \n              \n                  Your Application and/or Integration should not collect, store, and/or use personal data (meaning\n                  any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) without the consent of\n                  the data subject or a lawful basis to collect, store, or use such information.\n              \n              \n                  If your Application and/or Integration stores the personal data for a Customer and the Customer\n                  requests for their data or Content to be erased, you must erase their data and/or Content.\n              \n              \n                  If your Application and/or Integration stores the personal data for a Customer and the Customer\n                  modifies their data, you must either erase or update the data.\n              \n              \n                  Your use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google API s will adhere to\n                  the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use\n                  requirements.\n              \n              \n                  In the event CrmOne Customer Data or the CrmOne Platform is breached, compromised, or exploited\n                  by your Application and/or Integration, or by your organization, you must contact all affected\n                  Customers and CrmOne immediately.\n              \n          \n          B.

Use by Customers\n          If you are a Customer, you understand and agree that we are not responsible for your engagement with\n              a Service Provider. If you elect to engage with a Service Provider or procure a Service Offering,\n              the terms and conditions regarding your use or receipt of the Service Offerings are between you and\n              the Service Provider of those Service Offerings. Any questions, concerns or disputes that arise out\n              of your use of a Service Offering should be addressed with the Service Provider, not with us. The\n              Service Offerings may use, transfer, and/or store your data or information outside of the CrmOne\n              Marketplace or CrmOne product, and we are not responsible for any such use, transfer, or storage.\n              Please see the applicable Service Provider\u2019s terms and privacy policy for more information. If you\n              use the CrmOne Marketplace, its content (including without limitation, reviews), a Service Provider\n              listed on the CrmOne Marketplace, or any Service Offerings, you do so at your sole and exclusive\n              risk.\n          5. Use by Service Providers\n          As a Service Provider, you must comply with and abide by your other applicable agreements with us,\n              our AUP, and the CrmOne Marketplace Reviews Policy. It is important that you educate your business\n              partners, employees, and any third-party partners you work with about the CrmOne Marketplace Reviews\n              Policy as well. If you are a Service Provider, you must respond to inquiries or issues regarding\n              your Service Offerings within a reasonable period of time. If you are listed as a Service Provider,\n              we also expect that Service Offerings you provide are done so with good quality and in a\n              professional and workmanlike manner, in addition to any other industry standards, laws, or\n              regulations governing the quality and timeliness of your Service Offering. We may remove you as a\n              Service Provider or remove a Service Offering in our sole discretion, at any time, without notice to\n              you. Submitting your information as a Service Provider does not guarantee you will be listed in the\n              CrmOne Marketplace or promoted by us.\n          6. Reviews\n          The CrmOne Marketplace may permit you to post reviews about a Service Provider or Service Offering.\n              In an effort to maintain fair, accurate and useful reviews, you are required to abide by the CrmOne\n              Marketplace Reviews Policy, with respect to all reviews submitted. If you submit a review, you agree\n              that we may post all or a portion of the content of your review, along with your name and the date\n              of the review. We reserve the right to edit, remove or decline to post any review, at any time, at\n              our sole discretion. We are not responsible for the content of the reviews, whether or not we\n              reviewed or edited the content. Violations of our CrmOne Marketplace Reviews Policy may result in\n              termination of your ability to use the CrmOne Marketplaces, as well as any additional actions we may\n              deem necessary or within our rights to take.\n           7. CrmOne\u2019s Proprietary Rights\n          You are not granted a license to any software or any intellectual property rights by this Agreement.\n              The CrmOne products, services, and Marketplace are protected by intellectual property laws, they\n              belong to and are the property of us or our license (if any), and we retain all ownership rights to\n              them.

You agree that all such comments and suggestions will be\n              non-confidential and that we own all rights to use and incorporate them into the CrmOne products,\n              without payment or attribution to you.\n          \n          8. Service Offerings, Third-Party Sites and Products\n          The Service Offerings, Service Providers, Third-Party Products, and Third-Party Sites are not under\n              our control. Service Offerings, Service Provider listings, Third-Party Sites, and Third-Party\n              Products are provided to you only as a convenience, and the availability of any Service Offerings,\n              Third-Party Sites or Third-Party Products does not mean we endorse, support, or warranty the Service\n              Offering, Third-Party Product or Third-Party Product. Any information provided as part of a\n              Third-Party Product or Service Offering are subject to the control and accuracy of the Service\n              Provider.\n          9.

You agree that all such comments and suggestions will be\n              non-confidential and that we own all rights to use and incorporate them into the CrmOne products,\n              without payment or attribution to you.\n          We retain all ownership rights in CrmOne trademarks.

These features\n              may allow you to earn advocacy points (\u201cPoints\u201d) for participating in various marketing and\n              promotional activities, as described in the Customer Advocacy Guidelines that may be in effect from\n              time to time, which we will publish at or other website we may designate. There is no cost or\n              minimum participation threshold to participate. Points are valid for one year following the year in\n              which they were earned. Points have no monetary value, do not constitute property of the\n              participant, and are not transferable. Any gift cards or merchandise redemption\u2019s may be considered\n              taxable income and are the personal responsibility of the gift card redeemer to report.

If you elect to share CrmOne news or information, including links, through\n              your own social media accounts, you agree to always use hashtag #CrmOneAdvocate to identify your\n              relationship with CrmOne in such posts.\n          Participation in customer advocacy activities and benefits is at CrmOne\u2019s sole discretion, and CrmOne\n              may, in its sole discretion, terminate any participant\u2019s access to customer advocacy features or\n              suspend their eligibility to participate in customer advocacy activities or benefits, without\n              notice, for any conduct that CrmOne, in its sole discretion, believes is in violation of any\n              applicable law, is inconsistent with these terms or their purpose, or is otherwise harmful to the\n              interests of CrmOne or the Community. Upon termination, all accumulated and remaining Points shall\n              become void and irredeemable.

CrmOne Obligations The Subscription Service provides you with a number of controls that you can\n              use to retrieve, correct, delete or restrict Personal Data, which you can use to assist it in\n              connection with its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including your obligations relating to\n              responding to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under applicable Data Protection\n              Laws (\u201cData Subject Requests\u201d). \n           To the extent that you are unable to independently address a Data Subject Request through the\n              Subscription Service, then upon your written request we will provide reasonable assistance to you to\n              respond to any Data Subject Requests or requests from data protection authorities relating to the\n              Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement. You will reimburse us for the commercially\n              reasonable costs arising from this assistance.\n           If a Data Subject Request or other communication regarding the Processing of Personal Data under the\n              Agreement is made directly to us, we will promptly inform you and will advise the Data Subject to\n              submit their request to you. You will be solely responsible for responding substantively to any such\n              Data Subject Requests or communications involving Personal Data.\n  \n           5. Sub-Processors\n           You agree we may engage Sub-Processors to Process Personal Data on your behalf, and we do so in\n              three ways. First, we may engage Sub-Processors to assist us with hosting and infrastructure.\n              Second, we may engage with Sub-Processors to support product features and integration\u2019s. Third, we\n              may engage with CrmOne Affiliates as Sub-Processors for service and support. Some Sub-Processors\n              will apply to you as default, and some Sub-Processors will apply only if you opt-in.\n           We have currently appointed, as Sub-Processors, the third parties and CrmOne Affiliates listed in\n              Annex 3 to this DPA. You may subscribe to receive notifications by email if we add or replace any\n              Sub-Processors by completing the form available. If you opt-in to receive such email, we will notify\n              you at least 30 days prior to any such change.\n          We will give you the opportunity to object to the engagement of new Sub-Processors on reasonable\n              grounds relating to the protection of Personal Data within 30 days of notifying you. If you do\n              notify us of such an objection, the parties will discuss your concerns in good faith with a view to\n              achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached, we will, at\n              our sole discretion, either not appoint the new Sub-Processor, or permit you to suspend or terminate\n              the affected Subscription Service in accordance with the termination provisions of the Agreement\n              without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by you prior to\n              suspension or termination). \n          Where we engage Sub-Processors, we will impose data protection terms on the Sub-Processors that\n              provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as those in this DPA, to the extent\n              applicable to the nature of the services provided by such Sub-Processors. We will remain responsible\n              for each Sub-Processor\u2019s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions\n              of such Sub-Processor that cause us to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.\n  \n           6. Data Transfers\n           You acknowledge and agree that we may access and Process Personal Data on a global basis as\n              necessary to provide the Subscription Service in accordance with the Agreement, and in particular\n              that Personal Data may be transferred to and Processed by CrmOne, Inc. in the United States and to\n              other jurisdictions where CrmOne Affiliates and Sub-Processors have operations. Wherever Personal\n              Data is transferred outside its country of origin, each party will ensure such transfers are made in\n              compliance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws.\n  \n           7. Demonstration of Compliance\n           We will make all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA available\n              to you and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections conducted by you or your\n              auditor in order to assess compliance with this DPA, where required by applicable law. You\n              acknowledge and agree that you will exercise your audit rights under this DPA by instructing us to\n              comply with the audit measures described in this \u2018Demonstration of Compliance\u2019 section.

Upon request, we will supply (on a confidential basis) our SOC 2 report\n              and summary copies of our penetration testing report(s) to you so that you can verify our compliance\n              with this DPA. You may download copies of these documents from CrmOne\u2019s Security website. Further,\n              at your written request, we will provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all\n              reasonable requests for information made by you necessary to confirm our compliance with this DPA,\n              provided that you will not exercise this right more than once per calendar year unless you have\n              reasonable grounds to suspect non-compliance with the DPA.\n  \n           8. Additional Provisions for European Data\n           a. Scope. This \u2018Additional Provisions for European Data\u2019 section will apply only with respect to\n              European Data.\n           b. Roles of the Parties. When Processing European Data in accordance with your Instructions, the\n              parties acknowledge and agree that you are the Controller of European Data and we are the Processor.\n          \n           c.

Transfer Mechanisms for Data Transfers. \n           (A) CrmOne will not transfer European Data to any country or recipient not recognized as providing\n              an adequate level of protection for Personal Data (within the meaning of applicable European Data\n              Protection Laws), unless it first takes all such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is\n              in compliance with applicable European Data Protection Laws. Such measures may include (without\n              limitation) (i) transferring such data to a recipient that is covered by a suitable framework or\n              other legally adequate transfer mechanism recognized by the relevant authorities or courts as\n              providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data, including the Data Privacy Framework;\n              (ii) to a recipient that has achieved binding corporate rules authorization in accordance with\n              European Data Protection Laws; or (iii) to a recipient that has executed the Standard Contractual\n              Clauses in each case as adopted or approved in accordance with applicable European Data Protection\n              Laws.\n           (B) You acknowledge that in connection with the performance of the Subscription Services, CrmOne,\n              Inc. is a recipient of European Data in the United States.

CrmOne, Inc. will use the Data Privacy Framework to lawfully receive\n              European Data in the United States and ensure that it provides at least the same level of protection\n              to such European Data as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles and will let you know\n              if it is unable to comply with this requirement.\n           (2) Standard Contractual Clauses. If European Data Protection Laws require that appropriate\n              safeguards are put in place (for example, if the Data Privacy Framework does not cover the transfer\n              to CrmOne, Inc. and/or the Data Privacy Framework is invalidated), the Standard Contractual Clauses\n              will be incorporated by reference and form part of the Agreement as follows:\n           (a) In relation to European Data that is subject to the GDPR (i) Customer is the \u201cdata exporter\u201d and\n              CrmOne, Inc. is the \u201cdata importer\u201d; (ii) the Module Two terms apply to the extent the Customer is a\n              Controller of European Data and the Module Three terms apply to the extent the Customer is a\n              Processor of European Data; (iii) in Clause 7, the optional docking clause applies; (iv) in Clause\n              9, Option 2 applies and changes to Sub-Processors will be notified in accordance with the\n              \u2018Sub-Processors\u2019 section of this DPA; (v) in Clause 11, the optional language is deleted; (vi) in\n              Clauses 17 and 18, the parties agree that the governing law and forum for disputes for the Standard\n              Contractual Clauses will be determined in accordance with the \u2018Contracting Entity; Applicable Law;\n              Notice\u2019 section of the Jurisdiction Specific Terms or, if such section does not specify an EU Member\n              State, the Republic of Ireland (without reference to conflicts of law principles); (vii) the Annexes\n              of the Standard Contractual Clauses will be deemed completed with the information set out in the\n              Annexes of this DPA; (viii) the supervisory authority that will act as competent supervisory\n              authority will be determined in accordance with GDPR; and (ix) if and to the extent the Standard\n              Contractual Clauses conflict with any provision of this DPA the Standard Contractual Clauses will\n              prevail to the extent of such conflict.\n           (b) In relation to European Data that is subject to the UK GDPR, the Standard Contractual Clauses\n              will apply in accordance with sub-section (a) and the following modifications (i) the Standard\n              Contractual Clauses will be modified and interpreted in accordance with the UK Addendum, which will\n              be incorporated by reference and form an integral part of the Agreement; (ii) Tables 1, 2 and 3 of\n              the UK Addendum will be deemed completed with the information set out in the Annexes of this DPA and\n              Table 4 will be deemed completed by selecting \u201cneither party\u201d; and (iii) any conflict between the\n              terms of the Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK Addendum will be resolved in accordance with\n              Section 10 and Section 11 of the UK Addendum.\n           (c) In relation to European Data that is subject to the Swiss DPA, the Standard Contractual Clauses\n              will apply in accordance with sub-section (a) and the following modifications (i) references to\n              \u201cRegulation (EU) 2016/679\u201d will be interpreted as references to the Swiss DPA; (ii) references to\n              \u201cEU\u201d, \u201cUnion\u201d and \u201cMember State law\u201d will be interpreted as references to Swiss law; and (iii)\n              references to the \u201ccompetent supervisory authority\u201d and \u201ccompetent courts\u201d will be replaced with the\n              \u201cthe Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner \u201d and the \u201crelevant courts in\n              Switzerland\u201d.\n          (d) You agree that by complying with our obligations under the \u2018Sub-Processors\u2019 section of this DPA,\n              CrmOne, Inc. fulfills its obligations under Section 9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses. For the\n              purposes of Clause 9(c) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, you acknowledge that we may be\n              restricted from disclosing Sub-Processor agreements but we will use reasonable efforts to require\n              any Sub-Processor we appoint to permit it to disclose the Sub-Processor agreement to you and will\n              provide (on a confidential basis) all information we reasonably can. You also acknowledge and agree\n              that you will exercise your audit rights under Clause 8.9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses by\n              instructing us to comply with the measures described in the \u2018Demonstration of Compliance\u2019 section of\n              this DPA. \n           (e) Where the CrmOne contracting entity under the Agreement is not CrmOne, Inc., such contracting\n              entity (not CrmOne, Inc.) will remain fully and solely responsible and liable to you for the\n              performance of the Standard Contractual Clauses by CrmOne, Inc., and you will direct any\n              instructions, claims or enquiries in relation to the Standard Contractual Clauses to such\n              contracting entity. If CrmOne cannot comply with its obligations under the Standard Contractual\n              Clauses or is breach of any warranties under the Standard Contractual Clauses or UK Addendum (as\n              applicable) for any reason, and you intend to suspend the transfer of European Data to CrmOne or\n              terminate the Standard Contractual Clauses ,or UK Addendum, you agree to provide us with reasonable\n              notice to enable us to cure such non-compliance and reasonably cooperate with us to identify what\n              additional safeguards, if any, may be implemented to remedy such non-compliance. If we have not or\n              cannot cure the non-compliance, you may suspend or terminate the affected part of the Subscription\n              Service in accordance with the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to\n              any fees you have incurred prior to such suspension or termination).\n           (C) Alternative Transfer Mechanism. In the event that CrmOne is required to adopt an alternative\n              transfer mechanism for European Data, in addition to or other than the mechanisms described in\n              sub-section (B) above, such alternative transfer mechanism will apply automatically instead of the\n              mechanisms described in this DPA (but only to the extent such alternative transfer mechanism\n              complies with European Data Protection Laws), and you agree to execute such other documents or take\n              such action as may be reasonably necessary to give legal effect such alternative transfer mechanism.\n          \n  \n           9.

We rely on contractual agreements, privacy policies, and vendor compliance\n              programs in order to protect data processed or stored by these vendors.\n           Physical and environmental security: We host our product infrastructure with multi-tenant,\n              outsourced infrastructure providers. We do not own or maintain hardware located at the outsourced\n              infrastructure providers\u2019 data centers. Production servers and client-facing applications are\n              logically and physically secured from our internal corporate information systems.

Customers who\n              interact with the products via the user interface must authenticate before accessing non-public\n              customer data.\n           Authorization: Customer Data is stored in multi-tenant storage systems accessible to Customers via\n              only application user interfaces and application programming interfaces. Customers are not allowed\n              direct access to the underlying application infrastructure. The authorization model in each of our\n              products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned individuals can access relevant\n              features, views, and customization options.

The WAF is designed to\n              identify and prevent attacks against publicly available network services.\n           Static code analysis: Code stored in our source code repositories is checked for best practices and\n              identifiable software flaws using automated tooling.\n          Penetration testing: We maintain relationships with industry-recognized penetration testing service\n              providers for penetration testing of both the CrmOne web application and internal corporate network\n              infrastructure at least annually. The intent of these penetration tests is to identify security\n              vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk and business impact they pose to the in-scope systems.\n          Bug bounty: A bug bounty program invites and incentives independent security researchers to ethically\n              discover and disclose security flaws. We implement a bug bounty program in an effort to widen the\n              available opportunities to engage with the security community and improve the product defenses\n              against sophisticated attacks.\n           iii) Limitations of Privilege & Authorization Requirements\n           Product access: A subset of our employees have access to the products and to customer data via\n              controlled interfaces. The intent of providing access to a subset of employees is to provide\n              effective customer support, product development and research, to troubleshoot potential problems, to\n              detect and respond to security incidents and implement data security. Access is enabled through\n              \u201cjust in time\u201d (JITA) requests for access; all such requests are logged. Employees are granted\n              access by role, and reviews of high risk privilege grants are initiated daily. Administrative or\n              high risk access permissions are reviewed at least once every six months.\n           Background checks: Where permitted by applicable law, CrmOne employees undergo a third-party\n              background or reference checks. In the United States, employment offers are contingent upon the\n              results of a third-party background check. All CrmOne employees are required to conduct themselves\n              in a manner consistent with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical standards.\n          \n           b) Transmission Control\n           In-transit: We require HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS) on all login interfaces and\n              for free on every customer site hosted on the CrmOne products. Our HTTPS implementation uses\n              industry standard algorithms and certificates.\n           At-rest: We store user passwords following policies that follow industry standard practices for\n              security. We have implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest. \n           c) Input Control\n           Detection: We designed our infrastructure to log extensive information about the system behavior,\n              traffic received, system authentication, and other application requests. Internal systems aggregate\n              log data and alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous activities. Our\n              personnel, including security, operations, and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.\n          \n           Response and tracking: We maintain a record of known security incidents that includes description,\n              dates and times of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and confirmed security\n              incidents are investigated by security, operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution\n              steps are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents, we will take appropriate steps to\n              minimize product and Customer damage or unauthorized disclosure. Notification to you will be in\n              accordance with the terms of the Agreement. \n           d) Availability Control\n           Infrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use commercially reasonable efforts to\n              ensure a minimum of 99.95% uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to power,\n              network, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) services.\n           Fault tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure redundancy and fail-over\n              protections during a significant processing failure. Customer data is backed up to multiple durable\n              data stores and replicated across multiple availability zones.\n           Online replicas and backups: Where feasible, production databases are designed to replicate data\n              between no less than 1 primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and maintained\n              using at least industry standard methods.\n           Disaster Recovery Plans: We maintain and regularly test disaster recovery plans to help ensure\n              availability of information following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes.\n          \n          Our products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless fail over. The server instances that\n              support the products are also architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This\n              design assists our operations in maintaining and updating the product applications and back end\n              while limiting downtime.\n  \n           Annex 3 \u2013 Sub-Processors\n          To help CrmOne deliver the Subscription Service, we engage Sub-Processors to assist with our data\n              processing activities. A list of our Sub-Processors and our purpose for engaging them is located on\n              our CrmOne Sub-Processors Page, which is incorporated into this DPA.\n  \n  \n  \n      \n\n      \n          Acceptable Use Terms & Conditions\n          CrmOne Acceptable Use Policy\n          This CrmOne Acceptable Use Policy (\u201cAUP\u201d) applies to the use of any product, service or website\n              provided by us (CrmOne), whether we provide it directly or use another party to provide it to you\n              (each, a \u201cCrmOne Service\u201d). This AUP is designed to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations\n              that apply to the CrmOne Service. This AUP also protects the interests of all of our clients and\n              their customers, as well as our goodwill and reputation. These terms are so important that we cannot\n              provide the CrmOne Service unless you agree to them. By using the CrmOne Service, you are agreeing\n              to these terms. \n          1.  Reporting Suspected Violations\n          2.  Prohibited Email Actions\n          3.  Email Opt-Out Requirements\n          4.  Telephone and SMS Marketing\n          5.  No Disruption\n          6.  Proper Usage of the CrmOne Service\n          \n          7.  Restricted Industries\n          8.  CrmOne Trademark Use\n          9.  Developer Terms\n          10.  General Terms\n          If you are using any CrmOne Service, this AUP applies to you. Every client of ours agrees to abide by\n              this AUP and is responsible for any violations. You are not allowed to assist or engage others in a\n              way that would violate this AUP. We will enforce and ensure compliance with this AUP by using\n              methods we consider to be appropriate, such as complaint and email failure monitoring. We may also\n              suspend or terminate your use of CrmOne Services pursuant to our Customer Terms of Service for\n              violations of this AUP. \n          We periodically update these terms and we will let you know when we do through the Notification app\n              in the CrmOne portal used to access your CrmOne subscription (if you have one), or by posting a\n              revised copy on our website. You agree to review the AUP on a regular basis and always remain in\n              compliance.\n          1. Reporting Suspected Violations\n          We encourage recipients of email messages sent using the CrmOne Service to report suspected\n              violations of this AUP to us by forwarding a copy of the received email with FULL headers to\n              connect@crmone.com.  We have a policy to investigate all of these reports and to respond in the way\n              we consider appropriate. \n          If you know of or suspect a violation of this AUP, you will promptly notify us in writing of the\n              known or suspected violation of this AUP.\n          2. Prohibited Email Actions \n          a. You may not use CrmOne to send spam. Spam can be in the form of bulk email or one to one\n              commercial emails.\n          Bulk email is spam when it is unsolicited. Unsolicited means the recipient has not granted verifiable\n              permission for the message to be sent. Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger\n              collection of messages that have substantively similar content.\n              One-to-one commercial emails are spam when they violate CAN-SPAM. One-to-one commercial emails are\n              also considered Spam if the data processed for purposes of sending that email is in scope of the\n              General Data Protection Regulation (\u2018GDPR\u2019) and you fail to provide notice to individuals and\n              establish a lawful basis of processing.\n          \n          You may not use the CrmOne Service in any way (directly or indirectly) to send, transmit, handle,\n              distribute or deliver: (a) spam in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act (referenced below) or any other\n              law; (b) email to an address obtained via Internet harvesting methods or any surreptitious methods\n              (e.g., scraping or harvesting); (c) email to an address that is incomplete, inaccurate and/or not\n              updated for all applicable opt-out notifications, using best efforts and best practices in the\n              industry, (d) commercial electronic messages in violation of Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Legislation\n              (referenced below), or (e) in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \n          b. You may not use any misleading or false names, addresses, email address, or subject line. \n          Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the CrmOne Service may not: (a) use or contain invalid\n              or forged headers; (b) use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names; (c) employ any technique\n              to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the\n              transmission path; (d) use other means of deceptive addressing; (e) use a third party\u2019s internet\n              domain name without their consent, or be relayed from or through a third party\u2019s equipment without\n              the third party\u2019s permission; (f) contain false or misleading information in the subject line or\n              otherwise contain false or misleading content; or (g) use our trademark(s), tagline(s), or logo(s)\n              without our prior written consent and only then pursuant to our trademark usage guidelines.\n          If you use email, we recommend that you adopt the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working\n              Group Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP), which were created and agreed upon with\n              collaborative input from both volume email senders and Internet Service Providers. The Sender Best\n              Communications Practices document is available here. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to\n              follow these practices.\n          c. You may not email purchased lists. \n          You are prohibited from using the CrmOne Service to email: (a) purchased, rented, or borrowed lists,\n              and (b) lists that are likely to result in an excessive number of unsubscribe requests or Spam\n              complaints or notices, as determined by acceptable industry practices.\n          3. Email Opt-out Requirements \n          You warrant that each email you send or is sent for you using the CrmOne Service will contain: (a)\n              header information that is not false or misleading; and (b) an advisement that the recipient may\n              unsubscribe, opt-out or otherwise demand that use of its information for unsolicited, impermissible\n              and/or inappropriate communication(s) as described in this AUP be stopped (and how the recipient can\n              notify you that it wants to unsubscribe, opt-out, or stop this use of its information). These\n              requirements may not apply if the email sent is a transactional email and these requirements are not\n              otherwise required by law. You warrant that you will promptly comply with all opt-out, unsubscribe,\n              \u201cdo not call\u201d and \u201cdo not send\u201d requests.\n          4. Telephone, SMS, and Message Marketing\n          You must comply with all laws relating to telephone marketing, including without limitation those\n              specifically referenced in the \u2018Proper Usage of CrmOne Service\u2019 section below. You must comply with\n              all laws related to the recording of phone calls and ensure all proper consent to record is obtained\n              prior to making any such recording. If you use the CrmOne Service to place telephone calls, you must\n              also comply with all applicable industry standards, including those applicable guidelines published\n              by the CTIA and the Mobile Marketing Association. You are prohibited from using or permitting access\n              to use the CrmOne Service to make emergency calls or to provide or seek emergency services.\n          You understand that you are required to comply with carrier compliance obligations and penalties in\n              addition to these terms, which may have additional restrictions and requirements. \n          5. No Disruption\n          You agree not to:\n          (a) use the CrmOne Service in a way that impacts the normal operation, privacy, integrity or security\n              of another\u2019s property. Another\u2019s property includes another\u2019s account(s), domain name(s), URL(s),\n              website(s), network(s), system(s), facilities, equipment, data, other information, or business\n              operations;\n          (b) use or launch any automated system, including, \u201crobots,\u201d \u201cspiders,\u201d or \u201coffline readers,\u201d that\n              sends more request messages to our servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably\n              produce in the same period by using a conventional browser (also for example, scraping or\n              harvesting);\n          (c) use the Subscription Service in any manner that damages, disables, overburdens, or impairs any of\n              our websites or interferes with any other party\u2019s use of the Subscription Service;\n          (d) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Subscription Service; \n          (e) access the Subscription Service using another User\u2019s unique login credentials, including reusing\n              or sharing unique login credentials among multiple users;\n          (f) allow any Users to access the CrmOne Service from an embargoed country, or allow access to the\n              CrmOne Service to anyone included in the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Denied Persons List, Entry List,\n              the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s list of Specially Designated Nationals, or other similarly sanctioned\n              individuals;\n          (g) access the Subscription Service other than through our interface; \n          (h) use the CrmOne Service to gain unauthorized access to, use, monitor, make an unauthorized\n              reference to, another\u2019s property, unless you have the appropriate express prior consent to do so; or\n          \n          (i) use the CrmOne Service in a way that causes or may cause any CrmOne IP addresses, CrmOne domains,\n              or CrmOne customer domains to be blacklisted. \n          Examples of prohibited actions include (without limitation) include hacking, spoofing, denial of\n              service, mailbombing and/or sending any email that contains or transmits any virus or propagating\n              worm(s), or any malware, whether spyware, adware or other such file or program. \n          These restrictions apply regardless of your intent and whether or not you act intentionally or\n              unintentionally.\n          6. Proper Usage of the CrmOne Service\n          You will respect the limits that apply to your use of the CrmOne Service as specified in the Product\n              and Services Catalog available. We may update or change these Service Limits by updating, so we\n              encourage you to review this page periodically.\n          In addition, and without limiting the other requirements in this AUP, you may not (directly or\n              indirectly) use the CrmOne Service with content, or in a manner that:\n          \n              is threatening, abusive, harassing, stalking, or defamatory;\n              is deceptive, false, misleading or fraudulent;\n              is invasive of another privacy or otherwise violates another legal rights (such as rights of\n                  privacy and publicity);\n              contains vulgar, obscene, indecent or unlawful material;\n              infringes a third party\u2019s intellectual property right(s);\n              publishes, posts, uploads, or otherwise distributes any software, music, videos, or other\n                  material protected by intellectual property laws (or by rights of privacy or publicity) unless\n                  you have all necessary rights and consents to do so;\n              uploads files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs\n                  that may damage the operation of another person\u2019s computer;\n              downloads any file that you know, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally distributed in\n                  that way;\n              falsifies or deletes any author attributions, legal or proprietary designations, labels of the\n                  origin or source of software, or other material contained in a file that is uploaded;\n              restricts or inhibits any other user of the CrmOne Service from using and enjoying our website\n                  and/or the CrmOne Service;\n              harvests or otherwise collects information about others, including e-mail addresses, without\n                  their consent;\n              violates the usage standards or rules of an entity affected by your use, including without\n                  limitation any ISP, ESP, or news or user group (and including by way of example and not\n                  limitation circumventing or exceeding equipment use rights and restrictions and/or location and\n                  path identification detail);\n              is legally actionable between private parties;\n              is not a good faith use of the service, such as uploading Contacts in excess of your Contact\n                  tier, emailing those Contacts and then purging them shortly thereafter;

We may\n              also suspend your access as we explain in our Customer Terms of Service and, if you breach this AUP,\n              we may terminate your subscription agreement for cause. You acknowledge we may disclose information\n              regarding your use of any CrmOne Service to satisfy any law, regulation, government request, court\n              order, subpoena or other legal process.

This Policy sets out our commitment to hosting Customer Data in a specific location and the\n              exceptions to that commitment. \n          In 2021, we began offering a location specific regional data hosting service (\u201cRegional Data\n              Hosting\u201d) to new customers as part of their subscription. New customers who purchase the\n              Subscription Service after 2021, and who are located in Europe (including Switzerland and the United\n              Kingdom), Russia, the Middle East and Africa will have their Customer Data hosted in Europe by\n              default (based on your IP address on sign up) in accordance with this Policy. If your Order Form\n              does not indicate a data hosting location, your Customer Data will be stored in the United States of\n              America (\u201cUSA\u201d).\n          Any terms not defined in this Policy will have the same meaning as set out in the CrmOne Customer\n              Terms of Service. In the event of a conflict between this Policy and the Agreement, this Policy will\n              control. We may periodically update this Policy. We will post any changes on this page and, if the\n              changes are material, we will provide an update through the notification app in your CrmOne account.\n          \n          1. Regional Data Hosting Location and Customer Data\n          1.1 Definitions\n          \u201cLocation\u201d means the region or geographic area where your Customer Data is primarily stored within\n              our cloud infrastructure (e.g. North America or Europe). The location will be indicated on your\n              Order Form and in your CrmOne account. If no Location is specified in your Order Form your Customer\n              Data is hosted in the USA.\n          \u201cExclusions\u201d means the services and processing not covered by Regional Data Hosting Policy and which\n              will continue outside of the Location, as described in the \u2018Exclusions\u2019 section below.\n          1.2 If you purchase your Subscription Service after 2021, and you are located in Europe (including\n              Switzerland and the United Kingdom), Russia, the Middle East and Africa (based on your IP address on\n              sign up) we will store Customer Data within the Location for the duration of your Subscription Term\n              in accordance with the terms of this Policy. You agree that for the purposes of the DPA, this Policy\n              constitutes your Instructions in relation to the storage of Customer Data. The Location will be\n              indicated on your Order Form. If no Location is specified in your Order Form your Customer Data will\n              be hosted in the USA. Your Location will also be indicated in your CrmOne account. Your Customer\n              Data will be replicated for disaster recovery and back-up purposes to other data centers within the\n              Location. \n          1.3 You understand and agree that while Customer Data will be primarily stored and processed in the\n              Location: (i) CrmOne, Inc. is located in the USA and certain storage and processing may continue\n              outside of the Location, including in the USA and other regions where we, our Affiliates and\n              Sub-processors operate; (ii) we may change Sub-processors in order to provide the Subscription\n              Service, in accordance with the DPA; (iii) Customer Data may be accessed outside of the Location if\n              Users accessing the Subscription Service are located outside of Europe; (iv) except as otherwise\n              agreed only Customer Data that was submitted or collected after Regional Data Hosting was included\n              as part of your subscription will be stored in the Location; and (v) we make no warranty that\n              Regional Data Hosting will meet your data residency requirements. Regional Data Hosting does not\n              apply to the Exclusions, see the \u2018Exclusions\u2019 section below for further information. \n          1.4 This Policy does not apply if you previously agreed to the CrmOne Regional Data Hosting Beta\n              Terms. In that case, the terms in this Policy do not apply to you and the CrmOne Regional Data\n              Hosting Beta Terms will continue to apply until either (i) your CrmOne account is migrated to the\n              Location, or (ii) we notify you of the end of the CrmOne Regional Data Hosting Beta Program. The\n              CrmOne Regional Data Hosting Beta Terms will then cease to apply and this Policy will apply. \n          2. Exclusions\n          2.1 CrmOne Inc. is located in the USA and certain storage and processing may continue outside the\n              Location, including in the USA and other regions where CrmOne, its Affiliates and Sub-Processors\n              operate. Customer Data may be transferred and/or accessed outside the Location for the following\n              Exclusions: \n          (i) Customer and Product Development Support: In order to provide customer support and product\n              development support, CrmOne employees from other office locations and Sub-Processors may access your\n              CrmOne account and Customer Data. For example, we may access your CrmOne account if you call CrmOne\n              Support and have a question about how to use a certain feature or to fix a bug. \n          (ii) Security and Abuse Prevention: CrmOne employees from other office locations may access your\n              CrmOne account and Customer Data to investigate or remediate security incidents and/or product\n              abuse. \n          (iii) Integration\u2019s: If you choose to use integration\u2019s that process Customer Data, those\n              integration\u2019s may process and/or store Customer Data in locations other than the Location. Before\n              installing integration\u2019s, you should investigate how data is being passed to these integration\u2019s and\n              where the data will be stored and/or processed. You are responsible for any integration\u2019s you use in\n              conjunction with your CrmOne account.\n          (iv) User Access: Your Users may log in to your CrmOne account from areas outside of the Location.\n              This means that data may be accessed and transferred from the User\u2019s location. User access is your\n              responsibility.\n          (v) Usage Data: As described in the \u2018Customer Data\u2019 section of the Customer Terms of Service, we may\n              collect data about how you use and interact with the Subscription Service. This usage data will be\n              transferred from the Location to the USA. \n          (vi) Sub-Processors: CrmOne uses Sub-Processors to provide the Subscription Service and Consulting\n              Services. These Sub-Processors may have access to or process Customer Data (which may contain\n              Personal Data). As a CrmOne Customer, your Customer Data will be stored and processed by these\n              Sub-Processors within the Location, except for those listed in the table below. \n          You can review the list of Sub-Processors in Annex 3 of the DPA. You may choose to not use certain\n              features or integration\u2019s supported by the Sub-Processors included in the table below. If you wish\n              to use the features or integration\u2019s supported by these Sub-Processors, you acknowledge your\n              Customer Data will be processed and/or stored outside of the Location. \n      \n\n  ", "length": 560604, "excerpt": "We at CrmOne are committed to protecting your privacy.
