          <p>We do not control the content of our customers’ webpages or the types of Personal Data that our
              customers may choose to collect or manage using the Subscription Service. We store our customers’
              information on our service providers’ servers but process it as a processor under our customers’
              instructions and in accordance with our Customer Terms of service, which prohibit us from using the

              law. Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating the information
              they process using the Subscription Service and for complying with any regulations or laws that

          <p><strong>c. Information We Collect and Process When You Use the Subscription Service</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Usage Data</strong> </p>
          <p>We collect usage data when you or your users in your CrmOne account interact with the Subscription
              Service. Usage data includes metrics and information regarding your use and interaction with the
              Subscription Service such as what product features you use the most, when an object (like a ticket)
              is opened and closed, and how often certain features (like workflows) are triggered in your account.
          </p>
          <p>We engage third party providers to collect usage data. For more information about how we protect your
              information with these service providers, please see Section 3 “How We Share Personal Data”.</p>

          <p>When you access or use the Subscription Service via our mobile applications, we automatically collect
              information such as your device model and version, operating system, or device identifiers. </p>
          <p><strong>Third Party Integrations</strong></p>
          <p>You may connect third party integrations to your CrmOne account, which may ask for certain
              permissions to access data or send information to your CrmOne account. It is your responsibility to
              review any third party integrations you authorise. We may collect information about what types of
              integrations you use in your CrmOne account.</p>
          <p>Any permission(s) granted by you, grants these third parties access to your data, which may include
              (but is not limited to) granting third party applications access to view, store, and modify your
              CrmOne account data. We are not responsible for the practices of third party integrations, so please
              carefully review the permissions you grant to third party applications. For more information on
              integrations with third party providers, please see HERE.</p>
          <p><strong>Gmail Integration</strong></p>
          <p>If you use the Gmail integration or choose to integrate any other Google Workspace application with
              CrmOne, you will be asked to give us access to information from your Gmail or Google account. You
              can learn more about how we access this data HERE or via in-app notice when you connect to Gmail.
          </p>
          <p>By using the Gmail integration with the Subscription Service you will grant the Subscription Service
              access to information associated with your account, including contacts, emails, calendar,
              distribution lists, subject lines, and URLs of tracked links from your email, if you use the email
              tracking functionality. In addition, the Subscription Service will be able to read, modify, create,
              and send emails from your connected Gmail account. The Subscription Service will scan the content of
              your emails to identify which emails you have elected to track in order to provide you with the
              notifications feature. The Subscription Service will store replies, outgoing mail, email headers,
              subject line, distribution lists, aliases, time sent, and email bodies. Your email may contain
              sensitive information, such as names of your contacts, your private communications, or financial or
              medical information. You understand that the correspondences you track will be visible to other
              users on your Subscription team.</p>
          <p>If you connect your Gmail account via IMAP (or Generic Inbox Connection), the Subscription Service
              will have access only to email address, password, server information, email metadata, and message
              bodies. Additionally, connecting your Gmail account via IMAP does not require you to connect any
              other Google Workspace applications.</p>
          <p>Additional Limits on Use of Your Google User Data</p>
          <p>CrmOne’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to
              the <a class="content-link" href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google
                  API Services User Data Policy</a> , including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
          <p><strong>Google Calendar Integration</strong></p>
          <p>The Subscription Service will have access to both your Google Calendar and any other calendar you
              access via Google in order to power our Meetings tool, and allow you to associate events with
              contacts in your CrmOne account. The Subscription Service will have the ability to: create or change
              your calendars, and update individual calendar events.</p>

          <p class="content-title">2. How We Use Personal Data</p>
          <p><strong>a. To Communicate with You About the Product and Services</strong></p>
          <p>We use the account information you provide to CrmOne when signing up for the Subscription Service and
              Trends services to send you transactional emails or in-app notification about billing, account
              management, and other administrative matters. We may also send you updates regarding our Customer
              Terms of Service or other legal agreements, and may also communicate with you about security
              incidents via email or in-app notification. </p>
          <p>We use your information to provide customer support, such as resolving technical issues you encounter
              and analysing product outages or bugs.</p>
          <p>If you use the CrmOne mobile applications, we may send you push notifications from time to time in
              order to update you about events and promotions. If you no longer wish to receive such
              communications, you may turn them off at the device level.</p>
          <p><strong>b. To Provide the Subscription Service</strong></p>
          <p>We use your account information and Customer Data to provide the product and services to you. For
              example, we use the email address you provide when signing up for the product to create your user
              account, and we use your payment information to process payments for paid use of the Subscription
              Service. We also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer
              support.</p>
          <p><strong>c. To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services</strong></p>
          <p>We collect usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services. We use this
              data to develop and improve our products and services. For example, we use usage data to assess
              trends and usage across the product to help us determine what new features or integrations our users
              may be interested in. </p>
          <p>We use Customer Data for machine learning that supports certain products and development of features
              and functionality with the Subscription Service and similar products and services. For example,
              machine learning helps power the business card scanner tool if you use our mobile apps and allows
              for easier imports of data into your CrmOne account. You may opt-out of having your Customer Data
              used for machine learning by emailing at <a href="mailto:connect@crmone.com" class="content-link">connect@crmone.com</a> </p>
          <p>We may publish data about how our product and services are being used across our customer base. When
              we share statistical information externally in this way, the data will be aggregated and we will not
              identify individual users or customers. For example, we may publish blog posts on trends or insights
              into how users are interacting with our product. </p>
          <p><strong>d. To Secure and Protect our Product and CrmOne Users</strong></p>
          <p>We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents. We may also use
              this information to meet legal requirements. We use your information to verify user accounts, new
              product sign-ups, and to detect and prevent product abuse. This includes enforcing our Customer
              Terms of Service..</p>
          <p>We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how
              you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and
              regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also
              collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns,
              investigate security events and incidents. For these purposes we do link this
              automatically-collected data to other personal data provided by you such as name, email address,
              address, and phone number. </p>
          <p><strong>e. To Market and Promote the Subscription Service</strong></p>
          <p>We use the information you provide to CrmOne to market and promote the products, services, and other
              offerings. For example, we use the information, like your email or physical address, to send
              information or CrmOne content to you which we think may be of interest to you by post, email, or
              other means and send you marketing communications relating to our business.</p>
          <p>You may opt out of receiving this promotional content by following the instructions contained in each
              communication that we send to you or by contacting us <a href="mailto:connect@crmone.com" class="content-link">connect@crmone.com.</a> If you unsubscribe from
              our marketing lists, we will continue to contact you regarding administrative matters, and to
              respond to your requests.</p>
          <p>We may also reach out to you via telephone to ask about other CrmOne products or services you may be
              interested in. If you have a call scheduled with a CrmOne representative, we may record and
              transcribe the call. You will be notified prior to the call that the call is being recorded, and you
              will be offered an opportunity to opt-out of having the call recorded.</p>
          <p>Where required by law, we will only send marketing communications with your consent. Otherwise, we
              will market and advertise our products and services on the basis of our legitimate business
              interests.</p>
          <p>We receive information from third party service providers and other sources such as third party
              providers of business information and publicly available sources. We may receive and use this
              information from these service providers and other sources in combination with other information we
              collect through other means described in this Privacy Policy for the purposes of providing you with
              updates and an improved Subscription Service, like personalised communications, event promotion, and
              tailoring the websites or product to improve user experience.</p>
          <p><strong>f. Other purposes if we obtain your consent</strong></p>
          <p>We share your data with third parties when you give us consent to do so.</p>
          <p><strong>g. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (EEA and UK visitors only) </strong></p>
          <p>If you are a website visitor located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom (“UK”),
              CrmOne Ireland Limited is the data controller of your Personal Data. CrmOne’s Data Protection
              Officer can be contacted Customer Terms of Service.</p>
          <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the
              Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally
              collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal
              Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not
              overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we
              may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.</p>
          <p>If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract
              with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your
              Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide
              your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our
              legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time
              what those legitimate interests are.</p>

              marketing, sales support and customer support. We may need to share your information with service
              providers to provide information about products or services to you. Examples may include removing

              assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order
              to provide you with better service, developing and improving the product and services, and providing

              except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your

              be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners, we will tell you who we are
              sharing data with, and provide a link to the co-marketing partner’s privacy policy so you can learn
              more about how to opt-out of the partner’s communications. These co-marketing partners are required
              to adhere to our privacy and data protection policies. </p>

          <p><strong>e. Compelled Disclosure</strong></p>
          <p>We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably

          <p class="content-title">4. How We Transfer Personal Data Internationally</p>
          <p><strong>a. International Transfers within the CrmOne Group</strong></p>
          <p>To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer information to other CrmOne Affiliates where we
              have operations for the purposes described in this policy. Please see Customer Terms of Service for
              a list of CrmOne Affiliates and their locations. </p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy will apply even if we transfer Personal Data to other countries. We have taken
              appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected wherever it is
              transferred. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”),
              Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“UK”) within and among CrmOne’s Affiliates, we make use of the
              EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy
              Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”). We also implement the Standard Contractual
              Clauses (approved by the European Commission and Swiss authorities) and UK Addendum to the Standard
              Contractual Clauses (approved by the UK authorities) where required, as well as additional
              safeguards where appropriate (such as commercial industry standard secure encryption methods to
              protect customer data at rest and in transit, TLS for CrmOne hosted sites, web application firewall
              protection, and other appropriate contractual and organisational measures), Please see our Data
              Privacy Framework below for more information.</p>
          <p><strong>b. International transfers to third parties</strong></p>
          <p>Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under
              contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws
              to the country in which you reside. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA,
              Switzerland or UK with third parties, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer
              including the European Commission-approved Data Privacy Framework Standard Contractual Clauses, as
              well as additional safeguards where appropriate. For transfers to or from the United Kingdom, we
              make use of the UK Addendum. For transfers to or from Canada, we make use of the standard
              contractual clauses. With respect to personal data received from or transferred to Canada, CrmOne is
              subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
              Please contact us if you need more information about the legal mechanisms we rely on to transfer
              personal data outside the EEA, Switzerland, Canada, and UK.</p>

          <p>CrmOne complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the
              EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) as set forth by the U.S.
              Department of Commerce (collectively “the Data Privacy Framework”).</p>

              Principles with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the European Union, and the
              United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) and to the Swiss-US DPF Principles with regard to the processing of
              Personal Data received from Switzerland. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and
              the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework,

          <p>If you are located in the EU, UK or Switzerland, you have the right to request access to the Personal
              Data that we hold about you and request that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Data if it is
              inaccurate or processed in violation of the DPF Principles. We will give you an opportunity to opt
              out where Personal Data we control about you is to be disclosed to an independent third party or
              used for a purpose that is materially different from those set out in this Privacy Policy. If you
              would like to exercise any of your rights, please contact us via the details provided below.</p>
          <p>In compliance with the DPF Principles, CrmOne commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints
              about our collection and use of your Personal Data. We will investigate and attempt to resolve any
              DPF Principles-related complaints within 45 days. EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or
              complaints regarding our handling of Personal Data received in reliance on the DPF Principles should
              first contact CrmOne here. </p>
          <p>If you have unresolved DPF-related complaints that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please

          <p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the DPF website, you may be entitled to invoke
              binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. The Federal Trade
              Commission has jurisdiction over CrmOne’s compliance with the DPF Principles.</p>
          <p>In the context of an onward transfer, CrmOne is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it
              receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on
              our behalf. CrmOne shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if our agent processes your Personal
              Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless CrmOne is not responsible for the
              event giving rise to the damage.</p>
          <p>Please note that under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in
              response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law
              enforcement requirements.</p>

              legally limited or excluded under law, related to your use of the Beta Services. For all Beta
              Services, the CrmOne Beta Terms available also apply. If we inform you of additional terms and
              conditions that apply to your use of the Beta Services, those will apply as well. We might require
              your participation to be confidential, and we might also require you to provide feedback to us about
              your use of the Beta Services. You agree that we own all rights to use and incorporate your feedback

          <p><strong>4.10 Third Party Sites and Products</strong></p>
          <p>You can choose to integrate Third Party Sites and Products with the Subscription Service. We are not
              responsible for any Third-Party Sites and Products or for any issues arising from or related to the
              Third Party Site or Product. The availability of any integration to a Third-Party Site or Product
              does not mean we endorse, support or warrant the Third-Party Site or Product.</p>
          <p class="content-title"><strong>5. AI PRODUCTS</strong></p>
          <p>We may offer products, features, or tools as part of the Subscription Services that are powered by
              artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (collectively, “AI Products”).
              The terms in this section govern your use of the AI Products within the Subscription Services. They
              do not apply to the use of any Third-Party Products or Third-Party Sites that are powered by
              artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies.</p>
          <p>The AI Products may be provided to you as a Beta Service, and if so, the CrmOne Beta Terms available
              at: <a class="content-link" href="https://legal.crmone.com/CrmOne-beta-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://legal.crmone.com/CrmOne-beta-terms</a>
              also apply. Some of the AI Products in your account may be toggled on or off by default; you can
              adjust these settings at any time in your account. Additional information is available in the CrmOne
              Knowledge Base.</p>
          <p><strong>5.1 Input and Output</strong></p>
          <p>You are responsible for any text, images, or other content you upload or submit to the AI Products
              (“Input”) as well as the text, images, or other content generated by the AI Products based on your
              Input (“Output”). You will ensure that your use of the AI Products, including Input and Output,
              complies with our Agreement and with applicable law. You acknowledge that (i) except to the extent
              it is Customer Data (as defined in the CrmOne Customer Terms of Service), Input will not be treated
              as Confidential information, therefore, you should not include any data or information in your Input
              that you’re restricted from using or sharing (for example, third party confidential information);
              (ii) Output will not be Confidential Information, also except to the extent it contains Customer
              Data); and (iii) Output may not be accurate or reliable and that you should independently review all
              Output before using or sharing it.</p>
          <p><strong>5.2 Ownership and Rights</strong></p>
          <p>Between you and CrmOne, you retain all rights you may have to use and exploit your Output and we
              retain all ownership in and to the AI Products, including but not limited to all algorithms or
              models and aggregated results of developing the AI Products. This means you can use your Output for
              any lawful purpose, including commercial purposes such as sale or publication, in accordance with
              the Customer Terms of Service (including these Product Specific Terms).</p>
          <p>You acknowledge that Output may not be unique across users and that the AI Products may generate the
              same or similar Output for you or a third party. For example, you may provide Input into an AI
              Product such as “What color is the sky?” and receive responses such as “The sky is blue.” These
              responses are not unique to you and you may not claim ownership in them.</p>
          <p><strong>5.3 Availability and Modifications</strong></p>
          <p>We do not guarantee the availability of the AI Products in any or all geographical areas.
              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any production downtime impacting the AI
              Products that results from a failure of a third party service provider will not be included in the
              Service Uptime Commitment.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in our Terms of Service or these Product Specific Terms, we
              may make changes to the AI Products that materially reduce the functionality provided to you during
              the Subscription Term or change the limits that apply to you at any time in our sole discretion.

          <p class="content-title">6. SERVICE UPTIME COMMITMENT</p>
          <p><strong>6.1 For the purposes of this ‘Service Uptime Commitment’ section, the following definitions will
              apply:</strong></p>
          <p>“Downtime” means a critical full outage/severe issue that constitutes a catastrophic problem causing
              complete inability to use the Subscription Service, excluding Free Services, across a significant
              portion of the production environment (e.g. crash or hang), resulting in production downtime and
              where there is no workaround or solution to the problem.</p>
          <p>“Excluded” means the following: (i) unavailability caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable
              control, including, without limitation, act of God, acts of government, emergencies, natural
              disasters, flood, fire, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems (other than
              those involving our employees), or any other force majeure event or factors; (ii) any problems
              resulting from Customer’s combining or merging the Subscription Service with any hardware or
              software not supplied by us or not identified by us in writing as compatible with the Subscription
              Service; (iii) interruptions or delays in providing the Subscription Service resulting from
              telecommunications or internet service provider failures outside of our datacenter as measured by
              our third party website availability monitoring provider; (iv) any interruption or unavailability
              resulting from the misuse, improper use, alteration, or damage of the Subscription Service; and (v)
              unavailability while we perform maintenance on the Subscription Service when necessary, in CrmOne’s
              sole, reasonable discretion.</p>
          <p>“Service Uptime” means (total hours in calendar month – Excluded duration – Downtime duration) /
              (total hours in calendar month – Excluded duration ) x 100% = Service Uptime.</p>
          <p>6.2 We will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet a Service Uptime of 96% for our Subscription
              Service in a given calendar month. All availability calculations will be based on our system
              records. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, as Customer’s sole and
              exclusive remedy for failure to meet Service Uptime commitments, in the event there are two (2) or
              more consecutive calendar months during which the Service Uptime falls below 96% in a given calendar
              month, Customer will be entitled to receive a credit equal to the pro-rated amount of fees
              applicable to the downtime as measured within two (2) or more consecutive calendar months during
              which the Service Uptime fell below 96%. The credit will be applied against an invoice or charge for
              the following renewal Subscription Term, provided Customer requests such credit within twenty (20)
              days of the end of the relevant calendar month in which CrmOne did not meet the Service Uptime of
              96%. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or this section, this ‘Service Uptime
              Commitment’ section does not apply to our Free Services.</p>

          <p>This Cookie Policy explains how CrmOne, Inc. and our affiliated entities listed on use cookies and
              similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our Websites <a href="https://www.crmone.com" class="content-link">www.crmone.com</a>. It explains what these technologies are and why we use
              them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
          <p class="content-title">What are cookies?</p>
          <p>A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you
              visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your
              browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information.</p>
          <p>Cookies provide a convenience feature to save you time, or tell the Web server that you have returned
              to a specific page. </p>
          <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, CrmOne) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set
              by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable
              third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like
              advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can
              recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain
              other websites. </p>
          <p class="content-title">Why do we use cookies?</p>
          <p>We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
              technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or
              “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our
              users to enhance the experience on our Websites and Subscription Service. For example, CrmOne keeps
              track of the Websites and pages you visit within CrmOne, in order to determine what portion of the
              CrmOne Website or Subscription Service is the most popular or most used. This data is used to
              deliver customized content and promotions within the CrmOne Website and Subscription Service to
              customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Third
              parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising,</p>
          <p>Analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
          <p class="content-title"></p>What types of cookies do we use and how do we use them?<p></p>
          <p>The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they
              perform. These cookies include:</p>
          <ul class="content-list">
              <li>
                  Essential website cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services
                  available through our Websites.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies are used to enhance the performance and
                  functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use. However, without these
                  cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Analytics and customization cookies: These cookies collect information that is used either in
                  aggregate form to help us understand how our Websites are being used or how effective our
                  marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Websites for you.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Advertising cookies: These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.
                  They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that
                  ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are
                  based on your interests.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Social networking cookies: These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that
                  you find interesting on our Websites through third party social networking and other websites.
                  These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.
              </li>
  
          </ul>
          <p class="content-title">How can I control cookies?</p>
          <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie
              preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided below.</p>
          <p>You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject
              cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
              website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser
              controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more
              information.</p>
          <p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. Please
              note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic
              advertisements.</p>
          <p>Essential website cookies: Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Websites to
              you, you cannot refuse them. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings however,
              as described above.</p>
  
          <p class="content-title">What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</p>
          <p>Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website that help us better manage
              the Website and Subscription Service by informing us what content is effective. They are tiny
              graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online
              movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive,
              are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of
              this sentence. We use or pixels in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been
              opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the
              effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by in emails to our
              customers’ Personal Information.</p>
  
          <p class="content-title">Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</p>
          <p>The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences
              and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the
              one provided by your Web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often
              referred to as “Flash cookies.” CrmOne does not use Flash cookies. However, our customers of our
              software platform may create pages on the CrmOne platform that employ Adobe Flash cookies. CrmOne
              does not have access or control over our customers’ Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash
              management tools from Adobe’s website directly <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" class="content-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Similarly, our customers may create pages using the CrmOne Subscription Service that use technology
              from tracking utility companies. The use of these technologies by our customers is not covered by
              our Cookie Policy or Privacy Notice. We do not have control over third party cookies or trackers our
              customers use.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Do you serve targeted advertising?</p>
          <p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our
              Websites. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order
              to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may
              also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be
              accomplished by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and
              other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential
              interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to
              identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to
              provide these.</p>
          <p class="content-title">How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</p>
          <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the

          <p class="content-title">What is the GDPR anyway?</p>
          <p>
              The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is an EU Regulation that significantly enhances the
              protection of the personal data of EU citizens and increases the obligations on organisations who
              collect or process personal data. The regulation builds on many of the 1995 Directive’s requirements
              for data privacy and security, but includes several new provisions to bolster the rights of data
              subjects and add harsher penalties for violations. The regulate came into effect on May 25th, 2018.

          <p class="content-title">What was the story before the GDPR?</p>
          <p>
              You’ve likely heard a lot about the GDPR in 2018, but did you know we’ve had data protection
              legislation in the EU for quite a while already? Although the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive was
              replaced by the GPDR in May 2018, the Directive sets out the eight data protection principles which
              have been governing the treatment of personal data by&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;for over two decades!
          </p>
          <p class="content-title">Does the GDPR apply to me?</p>
          <p>
              The GDPR applies to businesses that a) market their products to people in the EU or who b) monitor
              the behavior of people in the EU. In other words, even if you’re based outside of the EU but you
              control or process the data of EU citizens, the GDPR will apply to you.

              <strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong> This website is neither a magnum opus on EU data privacy nor legal
              advice for your
              company to use in complying with EU data privacy laws like the GDPR. Instead, it provides background
              information to help you better understand how CrmOne has addressed some important legal points. This
              legal information is not the same as legal advice, where an attorney applies the law to your
              specific circumstances, so we insist that you consult an attorney if you’d like advice on your
              interpretation of this information or its accuracy. In a nutshell, you may not rely on this paper as
              legal advice, nor as a recommendation of any particular legal understanding.
          </p>
          <p class="content-title">Important components of the GDPR</p>
          <ul class="content-list">
              <li>Individual’s Rights</li>
              <li>Internal Procedures</li>
              <li>Supervisory Authorities</li>
              <li>Scope, Accountability and Penalties</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="content-title">Consent&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The GDPR steps up the standard for disclosures when obtaining consent, as it needs to be “freely
              given, specific, informed and unambiguous,” with controllers using “clear and plain” legal language
              that is “clearly distinguishable from other matters”. Controllers will also be required to provide
              evidence that their processes are compliant and followed in each case.</p>
          <p>Essentially, your customer cannot be forced into consent, or be unaware that they are consenting to
              processing of their personal data. They must also know exactly what they are consenting to and they
              must be informed in advance of their right to withdraw that consent. Obtaining consent requires a
              positive indication of agreement – it cannot be inferred from silence, pre-ticked boxes or
              inactivity. This means that informing the user during the opt-in is becoming more important.</p>
          <p class="content-title">New Rights for Individuals</p>
          <p>The regulation also builds in two new rights for data subjects: a “right to be forgotten”&nbsp;that
              requires controllers to alert downstream recipients of deletion requests and a “right to data
              portability”&nbsp;that allows data subjects to demand a copy of their data in a common format. These two
              rights make it easier for users to request that any information stored should be deleted or that
              information that has been collected should be shared with them.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Access Requests</p>
          <p>Data subjects always had a right to request access to their data. But the GDPR enhances these rights.
              In most cases, you will not be able to charge for processing an access request, unless you can
              demonstrate that the cost will be excessive. The timescale for processing an access request will
              also drop to a one month period but this can be extended a further two months in some circumstances.
              In certain cases, organizations may refuse to grant an access request, for example where the request
              is deemed manifestly unfounded or excessive. However, organizations will need to have clear refusal
              policies and procedures in place, and demonstrate why the request meets these criteria.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Privacy by Design and DPIA</p>
          <p>There are several new principles for entities that handle personal data, including a requirement to
              build in data privacy&nbsp;“by design”&nbsp;when developing new systems and an obligation to perform a Data
              Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) when processing using&nbsp;“new technologies”&nbsp;or in risky ways. A DPIA
              is the process of systematically considering the potential impact that a project or initiative might
              have on the privacy of individuals so that potential privacy issues can be identified before they
              arise, giving the organization time to come up with a way to mitigate them before the project is
              underway.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Data Privacy Officer</p>
          <p>On the security side, the GDPR requires many businesses to have a Data Privacy Officer (DPO) to help
              oversee their compliance efforts. Organizations requiring DPOs include public authorities,
              organizations whose activities involve the regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a
              large scale, or organizations who process sensitive personal data on a large scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="content-title">Contracts &amp; Privacy Documentation</p>
          <p>Since the GDPR is all about transparency and fairness, Controllers and Processors need to review
              their Privacy Notices, Privacy Statements, and any internal data policies to ensure they meet the
              requirements under the GDPR. If a Controller engages third party vendors to process the personal
              data under their control, they need to ensure their contracts with those Processors are updated to
              include the new, mandatory Processor provisions set out in Article 28 of the Regulation. Similarly,
              Processors should consider what changes they’ll need to make to their customer contracts to be GDPR
              compliant.</p>
          <p class="content-title">One-Stop Shop</p>
          <p>One particular item in the GDPR should serve to make the lives of these Data Protection Officers
              easier: the GDPR’s new&nbsp;“one stop shop”&nbsp;provision, under which organizations with offices in multiple
              EU countries will have a&nbsp;“lead supervisory authority”&nbsp;to act as a central point of enforcement so
              they don’t struggle with inconsistent directions from multiple supervisory authorities.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Reporting Breaches</p>
          <p>The GDPR contains a requirement that controllers must notify their country’s supervisory authority of
              a personal data breach within 72 hours of learning of it unless the data was anonymize or encrypted.
              In practice, this will mean that most data breaches must be reported to the Data Protection
              Commissioner. &nbsp;Breaches that are likely to bring harm to an individual – such as identity theft or
              breach of confidentiality – must also be reported to the individuals concerned.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Scope</p>
          <p>The GDPR applies to non-EU businesses who market their products to people in the EU or who monitor
              the behavior of people in the EU. In other words, even if you’re based outside of the EU but you
              control or process the data of EU citizens, the GDPR&nbsp;likely applies to you.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Accountability</p>
          <p>This concept requires Controllers and Processors to be able to demonstrate their compliance with the
              GDPR to their local supervisory authority. Processes should be recorded, implemented and reviewed on
              a regular basis. Staff should be trained and appropriate technical and organizational measures
              should be taken to ensure and demonstrate compliance.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Severe Penalties</p>
          <p>The importance of the GDPR’s new provisions is underscored by the new penalties it imposes for
              violations. Depending on the type of violation in question, controllers and processors who mishandle
              personal data or otherwise violate data subjects’ rights could incur fines of up to €20 million or
              4% of their global annual turnover&nbsp;(whichever is greater).</p>
          <p>If you’re already a CrmOne customer or partner, please contact your account manager if you have any
              further questions, comments or suggestions.</p>
          <p class="content-title">What did the law say before the GDPR?</p>
          <p>Although the DPD was replaced by the GPDR, it sets out the eight data protection principles which the
              GDPR builds on. These rules govern how organizations should treat personal data and are set out
              below:</p>
          <p>Obtain and process the personal data fairly</p>
          <p>Keep it only for one or more specified and lawful purposes</p>
          <p>Process it only in ways compatible with the purposes for which it was given to you initially</p>
          <p>Keep it safe and secure</p>
          <p>Keep it accurate and up-to-date</p>
          <p>Ensure that it is adequate, relevant and not excessive</p>
          <p>Retain it no longer than is necessary for the specified purpose or purposes</p>
          <p>Give a copy of his/her personal data to any individual, on request.</p>
          <p>The DPD&nbsp;was a Directive, which is a legislative act that sets out a goal that all EU countries must
              achieve. However, it is up to the individual countries to devise their own laws on how to reach
              these goals. In Ireland for example, the goals of the DPD were implemented through the Irish Data
              Protection Act, 1998.</p>
          <p>A Regulation on the other hand, such as the GDPR, is a binding legislative act which applies in its
              entirety across the EU.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="content-title">Is double-opt-in mandatory?</p>
          <p>For those unfamiliar with the term, “double-opt-in” is a 2-step mechanism where a person must confirm
              their email address after initially signing up. The GDPR does not require double-opt-in (though
              certain countries may make this mandatory).</p>
          <p>It’s worth noting that subscribers to the CrmOne service may already choose to enable double-opt-in
              functionality in their portals as an additional protective measure in proving they obtained the
              required consent.</p>
          <p class="content-title">How will Brexit impact the compliance for businesses based in the UK?</p>
          <p>In June 2016, a majority of UK voters voted in favour of leaving the EU in the&nbsp;“Brexit”&nbsp;referendum.
              In March 2017, Theresa May gave notice to leave the EU under Art. 50 which triggered the
              commencement of the Brexit negotiations.&nbsp;This regulator resource may be helpful as the terms of
              Brexit morph over time:</p>
          <p>If you’re based outside the UK but have vendors or affiliates in the UK with whom you share personal
              data, you’ll also need to keep an eye on developments in this area. When the UK leaves, cross-border
              data flows may not automatically have adequate safeguards&nbsp;and therefore additional projections may
              be required to protect data you transfer to the UK.</p>
          <p class="content-title">How are the Rights of Individuals affected by the GDPR?</p>
          <p>Individuals already&nbsp;had a lot of rights which protected their personal data under the 1995 Data
              Protection Directive, but the GDPR significantly strengthened these rights such that data subjects
              can now:</p>
          <p>obtain details about how their data is processed by an organization or business;</p>
          <p>obtain copies of personal data that an organization holds on them;</p>
          <p>have incorrect or incomplete data corrected;</p>
          <p>have their data erased by an organization, where, for example, the organization has no legitimate
              reason for retaining the data;</p>
          <p>obtain their data from an organization and to have that data transmitted to another organization
              (Data Portability);</p>
          <p>object to the processing of their data by an organization in certain circumstances;</p>
          <p>not to be subject to (with some exceptions) automated decision making, including profiling.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Does EU data now have to be stored in the EU?</p>
          <p>No. There is no obligation under the GDPR for data to be stored in the EU and the rules regarding
              transfer of personal data outside the EU will not change. This means that, as long as the personal
              data is&nbsp;“adequately protected”, data may be transferred abroad. For example, the EU has prepared a
              list of countries which they deem to provide an adequate standard of protection (known as&nbsp;“white
              listed countries”), so it is permissible to transfer data to those countries. Where a country is not
              on that EU list (for example, the USA), the controller must rely on use of approved contractual
              provisions (e.g. the Model Clauses or Corporate Binding Rules) or one of the other alternative
              measures, provided for in Law, such as the Privacy Shield certification.</p>

          <p>Read through our checklist to find out more.</p>
          <p>Since every business is different and the GDPR takes a risk-based approach to data protection,
              companies should work to&nbsp;assess their own data collection and storage practices&nbsp;(including the ways
              they use CrmOne’s marketing and sales tools), seek their own legal advice to ensure that their
              business practices&nbsp;comply with the GDPR.&nbsp;In determining your next steps, here are some of the
              questions you should consider.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="content-title">The Assessment</p>
          <p>What personal data do we collect/store?</p>
          <p>Have we obtained it fairly? Do we have the necessary consents required and were the data subjects
              informed of the specific purpose for which we’ll use their data? Were we clear and unambiguous about
              that purpose and were they informed of their right to withdraw consent at any time?</p>
          <p>Are we ensuring we aren’t holding it for any longer than is necessary and keeping it up-to-date?</p>
          <p>Are we keeping it safe and secure using a level of security appropriate to the risk? For example,
              will encryption or pseudonymisation be required to protect the personal data we hold? &nbsp;Are we
              limiting access to ensure it is only being used for its intended purpose?</p>
          <p>Are we collecting or processing any special categories of personal data, such as ‘Sensitive Personal
              Data’, children’s data, biometric or genetic data etc. and if so, are we meeting the standards to
              collect, process and store it?</p>
          <p>Are we transferring the personal data outside the EU and if so, do we have adequate protections in
              place?</p>
          <p class="content-title">The GDPR Project Plan</p>
          <p>Have we put a project plan together to ensure compliance by the May 2018 deadline?</p>
          <p>Have we secured buy-in at executive level to ensure we have the required resources and budget on hand
              to move the project forward?</p>
          <p>Do we require a Data Privacy Impact Assessment?</p>
          <p>Do we need to hire a Data Privacy Officer?</p>
          <p>Are we implementing a policy of ‘Data Protection by Design and Default’ to ensure we’re
              systematically considering the potential impact that a project or initiative might have on the
              privacy of individuals?</p>
          <p>Have we considered how we handle employee data in our plan?</p>
          <p class="content-title">The Procedures and Controls</p>
          <p>Are our Security team informed to ensure they’re aware of their obligations under the GDPR and do
              they have sufficient resources to implement any required changes or new processes?</p>
          <p>Do we have procedures in place to handle requests from data subjects to modify, delete or access
              their personal data? Do these procedures comply the new rules under the GDPR?</p>
          <p>Do we have security notification procedures in place to ensure we meet our enhanced reporting
              obligations under the GDPR in case of a data breach in a timely manner?</p>
          <p>Are our staff trained in all areas of EU data privacy to ensure they handle data in a compliant
              manner?</p>
          <p>Do we review and audit the data we hold on a regular basis?</p>
          <p class="content-title">The Documentation</p>
          <p>Do we have a Privacy Policy in place and if so, do we need to update it to comply with the GDPR?</p>
          <p>Do we have a defined policy on retention periods for all items of personal data, from customer,
              prospect and vendor data to employee data? Is it compliant with the GDPR?</p>
          <p>Are our internal procedures adequately documented?</p>
          <p>If we’re a data processor, have we updated our contracts with the relevant controllers to ensure they
              include the mandatory provisions set out in Art. 28 of the GDPR?</p>
          <p>In cases where our third party vendors are processing personal data on our behalf, have we ensured
              our contracts with them have been updated to include those same processor requirements under the
              GDPR?</p>
          <p class="content-title">Disclaimer</p>

          <p class="content-title">Personal data</p>
          <p>Any information related to a person or contact, for example: name, national ID number, address, IP
              address, etc. This type of information is also known as personally identifiable information (PII).
          </p>
          <p class="content-title">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</p>
          <p>A European Union (EU) law that protects the personal data of EU and European Economic Area citizens
              and residents. It outlines requirements necessary for both EU businesses and any business that
              collects or processes this personal data. Similar requirements can also be found in many national
              data privacy laws outside of the EU.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Controller</p>
          <p>A business or person that decides why and how to process data about a person. One example is a
              business owner serving as a Controller over its data stored in CrmOne, where the business makes
              decisions about how to use the data. Note: A business or person can be both a controller and a
              processor at the same time.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Processor</p>
          <p>A business or person that processes data. They process the data as instructed, but don’t have control
              over how or why it’s processed. For example, CrmOne is a processor for a business owner when CrmOne
              stores and processes data based on the business owner’s instructions. Note: A business or person can
              be both a controller and a processor at the same time.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Processing (data processing)</p>
          <p>Any action performed on personal data. This can be automated or manual. Examples include: collecting,
              organizing, recording, storing, or deleting data.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Consent</p>
          <p>Giving permission to use or share data. This could be done via opting-in or can be implied.</p>
          <p>Under the GDPR and similar data privacy laws, consent must be freely given, specific, informed and
              unambiguous. Consent must be positive and affirmative, and in some cases it must be explicitly
              given.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Affirmative or explicit consent</p>
          <p>When a person communicates clear approval and agreement to process their data. For example,
              responding “Yes” to receiving text messages from a business.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Implicit consent</p>
          <p>When consent can reasonably be assumed from a person’s action or inaction. For example, when a
              customer buys a product from a business, their personal data would be processed in order to ship the
              product, to provide customer support, etc.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Consent to process (data)</p>
          <p>When a contact has agreed to the collecting, storing, sending, etc. of their data, also known as
              processing data. Under the GDPR and other privacy laws, this permission must be “freely given,
              specific, informed and unambiguous.”</p>
          <p class="content-title">Consent to communicate</p>
          <p>When a contact has given permission to be contacted or receive communication. For example, via SMS,
              email, etc.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Double opt in</p>
          <p>A type of consent that requires two separate positive actions. For example, to double-opt-in to
              receive marketing emails would mean first signing up for the emails, then clicking on a separate
              email confirmation link. </p>

              rejected.</p>
          <p>If we notify you that you have been accepted into the Education Partner Program, the first thirty
              (30) days following acceptance is considered the “Provisional Acceptance Period”. During the
              Provisional Acceptance Period, we may desire to review your course(s) or learn more about your

          <p>You may not resell, lease, rent or otherwise use the Academy Content for profit, provided that the
              foregoing will not restrict you from charging tuition fees generally, which tuition fees would apply
              regardless of the inclusion of the Academy Content in your curriculum. You may not include the
              Academy Content in materials that are distributed outside of your classroom or organization (for
              example, for inclusion in a published book), without our review and express prior written consent.

              do the same. You will take all reasonable steps to ensure that students using the Academy Content do

              Terms, then you will immediately notify us in writing.</p>

          <p>No license to any software is granted by this Agreement. The Academy Content, the Academic Portal and
              the CrmOne products and services are protected by intellectual property laws. The Academy Content,
              the Academic Portal and the CrmOne products and services belong to and are the property of us or our
              license (if any). We retain all ownership rights in the Academy Content, the Academic Portal and the
              CrmOne products and services. CrmOne, the Sprocket Design, the CrmOne logos, and other marks that we
              use from time to time are our trademarks and you may not use them without our prior written
              permission, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.</p>
          <p>We encourage all customers and partners to comment on the Academic Portal and CrmOne products and
              services, provide suggestions for improving them, and vote on suggestions they like. You agree that
              all such comments and suggestions will be non-confidential and that we own all rights to use and
              incorporate them into the CrmOne products and services, without payment to you.</p>
          <p class="content-title">8. Confidentiality</p>
          <p>a. The Receiving Party shall: (i) protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the
              Disclosing Party using the same degree of care that it uses with its own confidential information,
              but in no event less than reasonable care, (ii) not use any Confidential Information of the
              Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement, (iii) not disclose
              Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party, and (iv) limit access to
              Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its employees, contractors and agents
              who need such access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality
              agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections no less stringent than those herein.</p>
          <p>b. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if required to
              do so under any federal, state, or local law, statute, rule or regulation, subpoena or legal
              process; provided, however, that (i) Receiving Party will provide Disclosing Party with prompt
              notice of any request that it disclose Confidential Information, sufficient to allow Disclosing
              Party to object to the request and/or seek an appropriate protective order or, if such notice is
              prohibited by law, Receiving Party shall disclose the minimum amount of Confidential Information
              required to be disclosed under the applicable legal mandate; and (ii) in no event shall Receiving
              Party disclose Confidential Information to a party other than a government agency except under a
              valid order from a court having jurisdiction requiring the specific disclosure.</p>
          <p>c. Injunctive Relief. Each party acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the other
              party’s Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the other party. Accordingly, each
              party agrees that the other party will have the right to seek an immediate injunction against any
              breach or threatened breach of this “Confidentiality” section of this Agreement, as well as the
              right to pursue any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity for such a
              breach.</p>
          <p>d. No Insider Trading. During the Term of the Agreement with CrmOne, Partner and its professors,
              officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, “Partner Representative(s)”) may be
              exposed to material, non-public information about CrmOne under federal or state securities laws.
              Partner Representatives understand that they may be found to be in violation of applicable laws if
              they take advantage of such information. If Partner Representatives are exposed to such material,
              nonpublic information, Partner Representatives agree not to: (1) trade in CrmOne’s securities
              (including common stock, stock options, other CrmOne-issued securities, or derivative securities),
              (2) have others trade in CrmOne’s securities on the Partner Representative’s behalf, (3) give
              trading advice of any kind about CrmOne, (4) disclose any material, nonpublic information to anyone
              else who might then trade, or (5) recommend to anyone that they purchase or sell CrmOne’s
              securities. If you have any questions regarding compliance with this section contact at <a href="mailto:connect@crmone.com" class="content-link">connect@crmone.com</a>.</p>

          <p class="content-title">Affiliate Acceptance</p>
          <p>Once you complete an application to become an Affiliate, we will review your application and notify
              you whether you have been accepted to participate in the Affiliate Program, or not. Before we accept
              an application, we may want to review your application with you, so we may reach out to you for more
              information. We may require that you complete certain requirements or certification(s) before we
              accept your application. If we do not notify you that you are accepted to participate in the
              Affiliate Program within thirty (30) days from your application, your application is considered to
              be rejected.</p>
          <p>If you are accepted to participate in the Affiliate Program, then upon notification of acceptance,
              the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply in full force and effect, until terminated,
              pursuant to the terms set forth below. Further, you will need to complete any enrollment criteria
              set out in the Program Policies Page, if applicable. Failure to complete any enrollment criteria
              within thirty (30) days of your acceptance will result in the immediate termination of this
              Agreement and you will no longer be able to participate in the Affiliate Program.</p>
          <p>Your acceptance and participation in the Affiliate Program does not mean that you will be accepted
              into any of our CrmOne Partner Programs, including our Solutions Partner Program or our App Partner
              Program. In order to participate in these programs, you will need to apply in accordance with the
              relevant application procedure.</p>
          <p>You will comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement at all times, including any
              applicable Program Policies.</p>
          <p class="content-title">Customer Transactions </p>
          <ul class="content-list">
              <li>Affiliate Program Limits. Each accepted Affiliate Lead will expire according to the information
                  provided in the Affiliate Tool (or if applicable, in the Program Policies) from the date the
                  Affiliate Lead clicked on the Affiliate Link that was made available by you. We will pay you
                  Commission as described in the Affiliate Tool (or if applicable, in the Program Policies) for
                  each new Customer who completes an applicable Customer Transaction after clicking on an
                  Affiliate Lead made available by you, provided that you remain eligible to receive Commission
                  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The start of the Customer’s subscription is determined
                  by the date of the first purchase or sign up (as applicable) of the Subscription Service by the
                  Customer and you will receive a Commission payment for that Customer Transaction only,
                  regardless of any additional purchases made by that customer during their Subscription Service.
                  For example, if the initial Customer Transaction is for one user of Sales Hub Professional, and
                  there is a subsequent purchase by that same customer for an additional user of Sales Hub
                  Professional for the same subscription, Affiliate will receive Commission for the initial user
                  purchase only. The Affiliate will not be entitled to receive Commission on any additional
                  purchases of CrmOne Products by that same Customer.</li>
              <li>Eligibility. To be eligible for Commission (i) an Affiliate Lead must be accepted and valid in
                  accordance with the ‘Acceptance and Validity’ section, (ii) a Customer Transaction must have
                  occurred, (iii) a Customer must remain a customer during the locking period in the Affiliate
                  Tool (or if applicable, in the Program Policies). You are not eligible to receive Commission or
                  any other compensation from us based on transactions for Other Products or if: (i) such
                  compensation is disallowed or limited by federal, state or local law or regulation in the United
                  States or the laws or regulations of your jurisdiction; (ii) the applicable Customer objects to
                  or prohibits such compensation or excludes such compensation from its payments to us or CrmOne
                  Affiliates; (iii) the Customer has paid or will pay such commissions, referral fees, or other
                  compensation directly to you, (iv) the Commission payment has been obtained by fraudulent means,
                  misuse of the Affiliate Link, in violation of any Affiliate Program Policies that we make
                  available to you, misuse of the Affiliate Tool or by any other means that we deem to breach the
                  spirit of the Affiliate Program, or (v) the Customer participates in any of our partner
                  programs, including our Agency Partner Program, Sales Referral Partner Program or Sales
                  Solutions Partner Program and is eligible to receive commission in relation to the Customer
                  Transaction under any of these programs. If at any point you are eligible to receive a revenue
                  share payment or commission under another Program at CrmOne, that payment amount will not change
                  based on your participation in the Affiliate Program. For example, you will not be able to
                  receive the Commission set out in this Agreement on any Partner Transaction that was completed
                  whilst participating as a partner in the Solutions Partner Program (as defined in the Solutions
                  Partner Program Agreement). In competitive situations with other affiliates, we may elect to
                  provide the Commission to the affiliate that we deem to be the most eligible for Commission, at
                  our discretion. We may discontinue Commission payments should any of the eligibility criteria
                  set forth in this subsection fail to be met at any time. </li>
              <li>Acceptance and Validity. You will only be eligible for a Commission payment for any Customer
                  Transactions that derived from Affiliate Leads generated by the Affiliate Link that we make
                  available to you and are accepted by CrmOne. An Affiliate Lead will be considered valid and
                  accepted if, in our reasonable determination: (i) it is a new potential customer of ours, and
                  (ii) is not, at the time of submission or sixty (60) days prior, one of our pre-existing
                  customers, or involved in our active sales process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may choose
                  not to accept an Affiliate Lead in our reasonable discretion. If an Affiliate Lead does not
                  purchase the Subscription Service within the time period described on the Affiliate Tool (or if
                  applicable, in the Program Policies) of their first click on the Affiliate Link, you will not be
                  eligible for a Commission payment, even if the Affiliate Lead decides to purchase after the time
                  period has expired. An Affiliate Lead is not considered valid if its first click on the
                  Affiliate Link is after this Agreement has expired or terminated. Engagement with Prospects.
                  Once we have received the Affiliate Lead information, we may elect to engage with the prospect
                  directly, regardless of whether or not the Affiliate Lead is valid. If an Affiliate Lead is not
                  valid then we may choose to maintain it in our database and we may choose to engage with such
                  Affiliate Lead. Any engagement between CrmOne and an Affiliate Lead will be at CrmOne’s
                  discretion.</li>
              <li>Commission and Payment. In order to receive payment under this Agreement, you must have: (i)
                  agreed to the terms of this Agreement (generally completed through the Affiliate Tool); (ii)
                  completed all steps necessary to create your account in the Affiliate Tool in accordance with
                  our directions, (iii) have a valid and up-to-date payment method in the Affiliate Tool with such
                  account (iv) completed any and all required tax documentation in order for the Affiliate Tool to
                  process any payments that may be owed to you.</li>
              <li>Requirements for Payment; Forfeiture. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
                  in this Agreement, if any of the requirements set forth in section 4(a)(i-iv) remain outstanding
                  for six (6) months immediately following the close of a Customer Transaction, then your right to
                  receive Commission arising from any and all Customer Transactions with the associated Customer
                  will be forever forfeited (each, a “Forfeited Transaction”). We will have no obligation to pay
                  you the Commission associated with a Forfeited Transaction. Once you comply with all of the
                  requirements in section 5(a)(i-iv), then you will be eligible to receive Commission on Customer
                  Transactions, as long as these Customer Transactions do not involve the same Customer associated
                  with a Forfeited Transaction.</li>
              <li>Commission Payment. We or the Affiliate Tool will determine the currency in which we pay the
                  Commission, as well as the applicable conversion rate. We will not pay more than one Commission
                  payment or other similar referral fee on any given Customer Transaction (unless we choose to in
                  our discretion). Taxes. You are responsible for payment of all taxes and fees (including bank
                  fees) applicable to the Commission. All amounts payable by us to you are subject to offset by us
                  against any amounts owed by you to us. Commission Amounts. We reserve the right to alter or
                  change the Commission amount as per the Affiliate Tool. </li>

          <p>2.13 Legacy Products. If you have a legacy CrmOne product, some of the features and limits that apply
              to that product may be different than those that appear in these General Terms, Product Specific
              Terms and/or the Product and Services Catalog. If you have legacy CrmOne products, we may choose to
              move you to our then-current products at any time. If you determine that you are using a legacy
              product and would like to upgrade to a current-version, you must execute a new Order.</p>

          <p>3.1 Subscription Fees. The Subscription Fee will remain fixed during the initial term of your
              subscription unless (i) you upgrade products or base packages, (ii) you subscribe to additional
              features or products, including additional Contacts, or (ii) otherwise agreed to in your Order. We
              may also choose to decrease your fees upon written notice to you. You can find all the information
              about how your fees may be otherwise adjusted in Product Specific Terms. Please review the Product
              Specific Terms for information on Commerce Hub Subscription Services that may have different fee
              structures.</p>
          <p>3.2 Fee Adjustments at Renewal. Upon renewal, we may increase your Subscription Fees up to our
              then-current list price set out in our Product and Services Catalog. If this increase applies to
              you, we will notify you in advance of your renewal and the increased fees will apply at the start of
              the next renewal term. If you do not agree to this increase, either party can choose to terminate
              your subscription at the end of your then-current term by giving the notice required in the ‘Notice
              of Non-Renewal’ section below. </p>
          <p>3.3 Payment of Fees. If you are paying by credit card, you authorise us to charge your Authorised
              Payment Method for all fees payable during the Subscription Term. You further authorise us to use a
              third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of your payment information to such
              third party.</p>
          <p>In the event of a failed attempt to charge your Authorized Payment Method (for example, if your
              Authorized Payment Method has expired or is no longer valid), we reserve the right, and you
              Authorized us, to retry billing your Authorized Payment Method. If you update your Authorized
              Payment Method to remedy a change in validity or expiration date, we will automatically resume
              billing; we may also receive updates on your Authorized Payment Method through our payment service
              providers and automatically resume billing. We may suspend your access in accordance with the
              ‘Suspension’ section or terminate your account in accordance with the ‘Termination for Cause’
              section if we remain unable to successfully charge a valid
              Authorized Payment Method. </p>
          <p>3.4 Payment against invoice. If you are paying by invoice, we will invoice you before the beginning
              of the Subscription Term and each subsequent Billing Period, and other times during the Subscription
              Term when fees are payable. All amounts invoiced are due and payable within specified in the Order
              Form.</p>
          <p>3.5 Payment Information. You will keep your business information up to date, including your company
              name, address, and primary contact. You will also keep your Authorized Payment Method and billing
              information up to date for the payment of incurred and recurring fees, including your tax
              information. </p>
          <p>Changes may be made on your Billing Page within your CrmOne account. You authorize CrmOne to continue
              to charge your Authorized Payment Method for applicable fees during your Subscription Term and until
              any and all outstanding Fees have been paid in full. All payment obligations are non-cancel able and
              all amounts paid are non-refundable, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement. All fees
              are due and payable in advance throughout the Subscription Term. If you are a CrmOne Solutions
              Partner that purchases on behalf of a client, you agree to be responsible for the Order Form and to
              guarantee payment of all fees.</p>
          <p>3.6 Sales Tax. All fees are exclusive of taxes, which we will charge as applicable. You agree to pay
              any taxes applicable to your use of the Subscription Service and performance of Consulting Services.
              You will have no liability for any taxes based upon our gross revenues or net income. If you are
              located in the European Union, all fees are exclusive of any VAT and you represent that you are
              registered for VAT purposes in your member state. At our request, you will provide us with the VAT
              registration number under which you are registered in your member state. If you do not provide us
              with a VAT registration number prior to your transaction being processed, we will not issue refunds
              or credits for any VAT that was charged. If you are subject to GST, all fees are exclusive of GST.
              If you are located in Canada, all fees are exclusive of GST, PST and HST.</p>
          <p>3.7 Withholding Tax. If you are required to deduct or withhold tax from payment of your CrmOne
              invoice, you may deduct this amount from the applicable Subscription Fee due to the extent it is due
              and payable as assessed withholding tax required under laws that apply to you (the “Deduction
              Amount”). </p>
          <p>You will not be required to repay the Deduction Amount to us, provided that you present us with a
              valid tax receipt verifying payment of the Deduction Amount to the relevant tax authority within
              ninety (90) days from the date of the invoice. If you do not provide this tax receipt within the
              specified time period, then all fees, inclusive of the Deduction Amount, will be immediately due and
              payable, and failure to pay these fees may result in your account being suspended or terminated for
              non-payment. </p>

          <p>If we determine that you are acting, or have acted, in a way that has or may negatively reflect on or
              affect us, our prospects, or our customers. </p>
          <p>This Agreement may not otherwise be terminated prior to the end of the Subscription Term.</p>

              Subscription Service, and each party will make reasonable efforts to promptly resolve the issues
              causing the suspension of the Subscription Service. Nothing in this clause limits our right to

              doubt, this refund does not include any fees owed from your use of CrmOne Payments, which is

          <p class="content-title">Content Moderation CrmOne</p>
          <p>Our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) prohibits use of the CrmOne Service with content or in a manner that
              promotes, encourages, or facilitates: illegal activity, hate speech, violence, or discrimination
              based on race, color, religion or creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, age, physical or mental
              disability, veteran status, genetic information and citizenship. In April 2020, we updated our AUP
              to add sexual orientation, marital status, gender or identity expression and parental status and
              any/or other characteristics protected by law; we clarified that organizations or individuals who
              promote, encourage, or facilitate hate speech, violence, or discrimination, either through their own
              content or through distribution of user generated content, are prohibited from using the CrmOne
              Service, regardless of whether the CrmOne Service is used specifically for the prohibited
              activities. </p>
          <p>We rely on our content moderation program to help us identify, review, and take action when CrmOne
              users violate these restrictions in our AUP. As part of this program, we’ve developed an internal
              content policy and guidelines to help us ensure we’re enforcing our AUP equitably and uniformly
              across our entire customer base. We’ve also formed a multi-member Content Review Committee (CRC)
              composed of diverse leaders from different parts and locations of CrmOne, which is responsible for
              reviewing reports about CrmOne users who engage in these activities, and determining what actions to
              take. </p>
          <p>The CrmOne content moderation program is intended to help us make decisions about certain users of
              our platform and the content we will allow (and not allow). It also helps us live up to our core
              values and principles as a company. It does not supplant the AUP or address other violations of the
              AUP – for example, we will still take action against illegal content, spammers, those abusing our
              platform, pornography, etc. under separate processes and guidelines.</p>
          <p>Complaints regarding CrmOne users may be provided by our employees, our customers or partners, or by
              anyone from the public. You may report content violations to us by sending an email to <a class="content-link" href="mailto:connect@crmone.com">connect@crmone.com.</a></p>

              </li>
              <li>
                  Your Application and/or Integration should clearly explain your data privacy practices, and be
                  prepared to tell Users how you plan to use the data that is being shared. This detail should be
                  included in an easily accessible privacy policy which explains to Customers how their data will
                  be collected, used, and processed and what control Users have over their data.

          <p>If you are a Customer, you understand and agree that we are not responsible for your engagement with
              a Service Provider. If you elect to engage with a Service Provider or procure a Service Offering,
              the terms and conditions regarding your use or receipt of the Service Offerings are between you and
              the Service Provider of those Service Offerings. Any questions, concerns or disputes that arise out
              of your use of a Service Offering should be addressed with the Service Provider, not with us. The
              Service Offerings may use, transfer, and/or store your data or information outside of the CrmOne
              Marketplace or CrmOne product, and we are not responsible for any such use, transfer, or storage.
              Please see the applicable Service Provider’s terms and privacy policy for more information. If you
              use the CrmOne Marketplace, its content (including without limitation, reviews), a Service Provider
              listed on the CrmOne Marketplace, or any Service Offerings, you do so at your sole and exclusive
              risk.</p>
          <p class="content-title">5. Use by Service Providers</p>
          <p>As a Service Provider, you must comply with and abide by your other applicable agreements with us,
              our AUP, and the CrmOne Marketplace Reviews Policy. It is important that you educate your business
              partners, employees, and any third-party partners you work with about the CrmOne Marketplace Reviews
              Policy as well. If you are a Service Provider, you must respond to inquiries or issues regarding
              your Service Offerings within a reasonable period of time. If you are listed as a Service Provider,
              we also expect that Service Offerings you provide are done so with good quality and in a
              professional and workmanlike manner, in addition to any other industry standards, laws, or
              regulations governing the quality and timeliness of your Service Offering. We may remove you as a
              Service Provider or remove a Service Offering in our sole discretion, at any time, without notice to
              you. Submitting your information as a Service Provider does not guarantee you will be listed in the
              CrmOne Marketplace or promoted by us.</p>
          <p class="content-title">6. Reviews</p>
          <p>The CrmOne Marketplace may permit you to post reviews about a Service Provider or Service Offering.
              In an effort to maintain fair, accurate and useful reviews, you are required to abide by the CrmOne
              Marketplace Reviews Policy, with respect to all reviews submitted. If you submit a review, you agree
              that we may post all or a portion of the content of your review, along with your name and the date
              of the review. We reserve the right to edit, remove or decline to post any review, at any time, at
              our sole discretion. We are not responsible for the content of the reviews, whether or not we
              reviewed or edited the content. Violations of our CrmOne Marketplace Reviews Policy may result in
              termination of your ability to use the CrmOne Marketplaces, as well as any additional actions we may
              deem necessary or within our rights to take.</p>

              advocacy features that are made available from time to time through CrmOne Community. These features
              may allow you to earn advocacy points (“Points”) for participating in various marketing and
              promotional activities, as described in the Customer Advocacy Guidelines that may be in effect from

              which they were earned. Points have no monetary value, do not constitute property of the
              participant, and are not transferable. Any gift cards or merchandise redemption’s may be considered
              taxable income and are the personal responsibility of the gift card redeemer to report. Participants

              may, in its sole discretion, terminate any participant’s access to customer advocacy features or
              suspend their eligibility to participate in customer advocacy activities or benefits, without
              notice, for any conduct that CrmOne, in its sole discretion, believes is in violation of any
              applicable law, is inconsistent with these terms or their purpose, or is otherwise harmful to the

              Laws (“Data Subject Requests”). </p>
          <p> To the extent that you are unable to independently address a Data Subject Request through the
              Subscription Service, then upon your written request we will provide reasonable assistance to you to
              respond to any Data Subject Requests or requests from data protection authorities relating to the

              reasonable costs arising from this assistance.</p>
          <p> If a Data Subject Request or other communication regarding the Processing of Personal Data under the
              Agreement is made directly to us, we will promptly inform you and will advise the Data Subject to

          <p class="content-title" id="datatab5"> 5. Sub-Processors</p>
          <p> You agree we may engage Sub-Processors to Process Personal Data on your behalf, and we do so in
              three ways. First, we may engage Sub-Processors to assist us with hosting and infrastructure.
              Second, we may engage with Sub-Processors to support product features and integration’s. Third, we
              may engage with CrmOne Affiliates as Sub-Processors for service and support. Some Sub-Processors
              will apply to you as default, and some Sub-Processors will apply only if you opt-in.</p>
          <p> We have currently appointed, as Sub-Processors, the third parties and CrmOne Affiliates listed in
              Annex 3 to this DPA. You may subscribe to receive notifications by email if we add or replace any
              Sub-Processors by completing the form available. If you opt-in to receive such email, we will notify
              you at least 30 days prior to any such change.</p>
          <p>We will give you the opportunity to object to the engagement of new Sub-Processors on reasonable
              grounds relating to the protection of Personal Data within 30 days of notifying you. If you do
              notify us of such an objection, the parties will discuss your concerns in good faith with a view to
              achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached, we will, at
              our sole discretion, either not appoint the new Sub-Processor, or permit you to suspend or terminate
              the affected Subscription Service in accordance with the termination provisions of the Agreement
              without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by you prior to
              suspension or termination). </p>
          <p>Where we engage Sub-Processors, we will impose data protection terms on the Sub-Processors that
              provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as those in this DPA, to the extent
              applicable to the nature of the services provided by such Sub-Processors. We will remain responsible
              for each Sub-Processor’s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions
              of such Sub-Processor that cause us to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.</p>

              necessary to provide the Subscription Service in accordance with the Agreement, and in particular

              other jurisdictions where CrmOne Affiliates and Sub-Processors have operations. Wherever Personal
              Data is transferred outside its country of origin, each party will ensure such transfers are made in
              compliance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws.</p>
  
          <p class="content-title" id="datatab7"> 7. Demonstration of Compliance</p>
          <p> We will make all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA available
              to you and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections conducted by you or your
              auditor in order to assess compliance with this DPA, where required by applicable law. You
              acknowledge and agree that you will exercise your audit rights under this DPA by instructing us to
              comply with the audit measures described in this ‘Demonstration of Compliance’ section. You

              independently validated security programs (including SOC 2 and ISO 27001) and that our systems are
              audited annually as part of SOC 2 compliance and regularly tested by independent third party
              penetration testing firms. Upon request, we will supply (on a confidential basis) our SOC 2 report
              and summary copies of our penetration testing report(s) to you so that you can verify our compliance
              with this DPA. You may download copies of these documents from CrmOne’s Security website. Further,
              at your written request, we will provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all
              reasonable requests for information made by you necessary to confirm our compliance with this DPA,
              provided that you will not exercise this right more than once per calendar year unless you have
              reasonable grounds to suspect non-compliance with the DPA.</p>

          <p> c. Instructions. If we believe that your Instruction infringes European Data Protection Laws (where
              applicable), we will inform you without delay.</p>
          <p> d. Data Protection Impact Assessments and Consultation with Supervisory Authorities. To the extent
              that the required information is reasonably available to us, and you do not otherwise have access to
              the required information, we will provide reasonable assistance to you with any data protection
              impact assessments, and prior consultations with supervisory authorities (for example, the French
              Data Protection Agency (CNIL), the Berlin Data Protection Authority (BlnBDI) and the UK Information
              Commissioner’s Office (ICO)) or other competent data privacy authorities to the extent required by

              an adequate level of protection for Personal Data (within the meaning of applicable European Data
              Protection Laws), unless it first takes all such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is
              in compliance with applicable European Data Protection Laws. Such measures may include (without
              limitation) (i) transferring such data to a recipient that is covered by a suitable framework or
              other legally adequate transfer mechanism recognized by the relevant authorities or courts as
              providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data, including the Data Privacy Framework;
              (ii) to a recipient that has achieved binding corporate rules authorization in accordance with
              European Data Protection Laws; or (iii) to a recipient that has executed the Standard Contractual
              Clauses in each case as adopted or approved in accordance with applicable European Data Protection
              Laws.</p>
          <p> (B) You acknowledge that in connection with the performance of the Subscription Services, CrmOne,
              Inc. is a recipient of European Data in the United States. To the extent that CrmOne, Inc. receives
              European Data in the United States, CrmOne, Inc. will comply with the following:</p>
          <p>(1) Data Privacy Framework. CrmOne, Inc. will use the Data Privacy Framework to lawfully receive
              European Data in the United States and ensure that it provides at least the same level of protection
              to such European Data as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles and will let you know
              if it is unable to comply with this requirement.</p>
          <p> (2) Standard Contractual Clauses. If European Data Protection Laws require that appropriate
              safeguards are put in place (for example, if the Data Privacy Framework does not cover the transfer
              to CrmOne, Inc. and/or the Data Privacy Framework is invalidated), the Standard Contractual Clauses
              will be incorporated by reference and form part of the Agreement as follows:</p>

              CrmOne, Inc. is the “data importer”; (ii) the Module Two terms apply to the extent the Customer is a
              Controller of European Data and the Module Three terms apply to the extent the Customer is a
              Processor of European Data; (iii) in Clause 7, the optional docking clause applies; (iv) in Clause
              9, Option 2 applies and changes to Sub-Processors will be notified in accordance with the
              ‘Sub-Processors’ section of this DPA; (v) in Clause 11, the optional language is deleted; (vi) in
              Clauses 17 and 18, the parties agree that the governing law and forum for disputes for the Standard
              Contractual Clauses will be determined in accordance with the ‘Contracting Entity; Applicable Law;
              Notice’ section of the Jurisdiction Specific Terms or, if such section does not specify an EU Member
              State, the Republic of Ireland (without reference to conflicts of law principles); (vii) the Annexes
              of the Standard Contractual Clauses will be deemed completed with the information set out in the
              Annexes of this DPA; (viii) the supervisory authority that will act as competent supervisory
              authority will be determined in accordance with GDPR; and (ix) if and to the extent the Standard
              Contractual Clauses conflict with any provision of this DPA the Standard Contractual Clauses will
              prevail to the extent of such conflict.</p>
          <p> (b) In relation to European Data that is subject to the UK GDPR, the Standard Contractual Clauses
              will apply in accordance with sub-section (a) and the following modifications (i) the Standard
              Contractual Clauses will be modified and interpreted in accordance with the UK Addendum, which will
              be incorporated by reference and form an integral part of the Agreement; (ii) Tables 1, 2 and 3 of
              the UK Addendum will be deemed completed with the information set out in the Annexes of this DPA and
              Table 4 will be deemed completed by selecting “neither party”; and (iii) any conflict between the
              terms of the Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK Addendum will be resolved in accordance with
              Section 10 and Section 11 of the UK Addendum.</p>
          <p> (c) In relation to European Data that is subject to the Swiss DPA, the Standard Contractual Clauses
              will apply in accordance with sub-section (a) and the following modifications (i) references to
              “Regulation (EU) 2016/679” will be interpreted as references to the Swiss DPA; (ii) references to
              “EU”, “Union” and “Member State law” will be interpreted as references to Swiss law; and (iii)
              references to the “competent supervisory authority” and “competent courts” will be replaced with the
              “the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner ” and the “relevant courts in
              Switzerland”.</p>
          <p>(d) You agree that by complying with our obligations under the ‘Sub-Processors’ section of this DPA,
              CrmOne, Inc. fulfills its obligations under Section 9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses. For the
              purposes of Clause 9(c) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, you acknowledge that we may be
              restricted from disclosing Sub-Processor agreements but we will use reasonable efforts to require
              any Sub-Processor we appoint to permit it to disclose the Sub-Processor agreement to you and will
              provide (on a confidential basis) all information we reasonably can. You also acknowledge and agree
              that you will exercise your audit rights under Clause 8.9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses by
              instructing us to comply with the measures described in the ‘Demonstration of Compliance’ section of
              this DPA. </p>
          <p> (e) Where the CrmOne contracting entity under the Agreement is not CrmOne, Inc., such contracting
              entity (not CrmOne, Inc.) will remain fully and solely responsible and liable to you for the
              performance of the Standard Contractual Clauses by CrmOne, Inc., and you will direct any
              instructions, claims or enquiries in relation to the Standard Contractual Clauses to such
              contracting entity. If CrmOne cannot comply with its obligations under the Standard Contractual
              Clauses or is breach of any warranties under the Standard Contractual Clauses or UK Addendum (as
              applicable) for any reason, and you intend to suspend the transfer of European Data to CrmOne or
              terminate the Standard Contractual Clauses ,or UK Addendum, you agree to provide us with reasonable
              notice to enable us to cure such non-compliance and reasonably cooperate with us to identify what
              additional safeguards, if any, may be implemented to remedy such non-compliance. If we have not or
              cannot cure the non-compliance, you may suspend or terminate the affected part of the Subscription
              Service in accordance with the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to
              any fees you have incurred prior to such suspension or termination).</p>
          <p> (C) Alternative Transfer Mechanism. In the event that CrmOne is required to adopt an alternative
              transfer mechanism for European Data, in addition to or other than the mechanisms described in
              sub-section (B) above, such alternative transfer mechanism will apply automatically instead of the
              mechanisms described in this DPA (but only to the extent such alternative transfer mechanism
              complies with European Data Protection Laws), and you agree to execute such other documents or take
              such action as may be reasonably necessary to give legal effect such alternative transfer mechanism.

          <p>a. Scope. The ‘Additional Provisions for California Personal Information’ section of the DPA will
              apply only with respect to California Personal Information.</p>
          <p> b. Roles of the Parties. When processing California Personal Information in accordance with your
              Instructions, the parties acknowledge and agree that you are a Business and we are a Service
              Provider for the purposes of the CCPA.</p>
          <p> c. Responsibilities. We certify that we will Process California Personal Information as a Service
              Provider strictly for the purpose of performing the Subscription Services and Consulting Services
              under the Agreement (the “Business Purpose”) or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, including as
              described in the ‘Usage Data’ section of our Privacy Policy. Further, we certify we i) will not Sell
              or Share California Personal Information; (ii) will not Process California Personal Information
              outside the direct business relationship between the parties, unless required by applicable law; and

              information that we collect or receive from another source (other than information we receive from
              another source in connection with our obligations as a Service Provider under the Agreement).</p>
          <p> d. Compliance. We will (i) comply with obligations applicable to us as a Service Provider under the
              CCPA and (ii) provide California Personal Information with the same level of privacy protection as
              is required by the CCPA. We will notify you if we make a determination that we can no longer meet
              our obligations as a Service Provider under the CCPA.</p>
          <p> e. CCPA Audits. You will have the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help ensure that
              we use California Personal Information in a manner consistent with Customer’s obligations under the
              CCPA. Upon notice, you will have the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps in accordance
              with the Agreement to stop and remediate unauthorized use of California Personal Information. </p>
          <p> f. Not a Sale. The parties acknowledge and agree that the disclosure of California Personal
              Information by the Customer to CrmOne does not form part of any monetary or other valuable
              consideration exchanged between the parties.</p>
  
          <p class="content-title" id="datatab10"> 10. General Provisions</p>
          <p> a. Amendments. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in the Agreement and without prejudice
              to the ‘Compliance with Instructions’ or ‘Security’ sections of this DPA, we reserve the right to
              make any updates and changes to this DPA and the terms that apply in the ‘Amendment; No Waiver’
              section of the General Terms will apply.</p>
          <p> b. Severability. If any individual provisions of this DPA are determined to be invalid or
              unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of this DPA will not be
              affected.</p>
          <p> c. Limitation of Liability. Each party and each of their Affiliates’ liability, taken in aggregate,
              arising out of or related to this DPA (including any other D Pas between the parties) and the
              Standard Contractual Clauses, where applicable, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory
              of liability, will be subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability set out in the
              ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the General Terms and any reference in such section to the
              liability of a party means aggregate liability of that party and all of its Affiliates under the
              Agreement (including this DPA). For the avoidance of doubt, if CrmOne, Inc. is not a party to the
              Agreement, the ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the General Terms will apply as between you and
              CrmOne, Inc., and in such respect any references to ‘CrmOne’, ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’ will include both
              CrmOne, Inc. and the CrmOne entity that is a party to the Agreement. In no event will either party’s
              liability be limited with respect to any individual’s data protection rights under this DPA
              (including any other D Pas between the parties and the Standard Contractual Clauses, where
              applicable) or otherwise.</p>
          <p>d. Governing Law. This DPA will be governed by and construed in accordance with the ‘Contracting
              Entity; ‘Applicable Law; Notice’ sections of the Jurisdiction Specific Terms, unless required
              otherwise by Data Protection Laws.</p>

          <p> a. Permitted Affiliates. By signing the Agreement, you enter into this DPA (including, where
              applicable, the Standard Contractual Clauses) on behalf of yourself and in the name and on behalf of
              your Permitted Affiliates. For the purposes of this DPA only, and except where indicated otherwise,
              the terms “Customer”, “you” and “your” will include you and such Permitted Affiliates.</p>
          <p> b. Authorization. The legal entity agreeing to this DPA as Customer represents that it is authorized
              to agree to and enter into this DPA for and on behalf of itself and, as applicable, each of its
              Permitted Affiliates.</p>
          <p> c. Remedies. The parties agree that (i) solely the Customer entity that is the contracting party to
              the Agreement will exercise any right or seek any remedy any Permitted Affiliate may have under this
              DPA on behalf of its Affiliates, and (ii) the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the
              Agreement will exercise any such rights under this DPA not separately for each Permitted Affiliate
              individually but in a combined manner for itself and all of its Permitted Affiliates together. The
              Customer entity that is the contracting entity is responsible for coordinating all Instructions,
              authorizations and communications with us under the DPA and will be entitled to make and receive any
              communications related to this DPA on behalf of its Permitted Affiliates. </p>
          <p> d. Other rights. The parties agree that you will, when reviewing our compliance with this DPA
              pursuant to the ‘Demonstration of Compliance’ section, take all reasonable measures to limit any
              impact on us and our Affiliates by combining several audit requests carried out on behalf of the
              Customer entity that is the contracting party to the Agreement and all of its Permitted Affiliates
              in one single audit.</p>

          <p class="content-title" id="datatab13"> Annex 2 – Security Measures</p>
          <p> We currently observe the Security Measures described in this Annex 2. All capitalized terms not
              otherwise defined herein will have the meanings as set forth in the General Terms. For more
              information on these security measures, please refer to CrmOne’s SOC 2 Type II Report, SOC 3 Report,
              Security Overview and Penetration Test Summaries</p>
          <p><strong> a) Access Control</strong></p>
          <p> i) Preventing Unauthorized Product Access</p>
          <p> Outsourced processing: We host our Service with outsourced cloud infrastructure providers.
              Additionally, we maintain contractual relationships with vendors in order to provide the Service in
              accordance with our DPA. We rely on contractual agreements, privacy policies, and vendor compliance
              programs in order to protect data processed or stored by these vendors.</p>
          <p> Physical and environmental security: We host our product infrastructure with multi-tenant,
              outsourced infrastructure providers. We do not own or maintain hardware located at the outsourced
              infrastructure providers’ data centers. Production servers and client-facing applications are
              logically and physically secured from our internal corporate information systems. The physical and
              environmental security controls are audited for SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance, among other
              certifications.</p>
          <p> Authentication: We implement a uniform password policy for our customer products. Customers who
              interact with the products via the user interface must authenticate before accessing non-public
              customer data.</p>
          <p> Authorization: Customer Data is stored in multi-tenant storage systems accessible to Customers via
              only application user interfaces and application programming interfaces. Customers are not allowed
              direct access to the underlying application infrastructure. The authorization model in each of our
              products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned individuals can access relevant
              features, views, and customization options. Authorization to data sets is performed through
              validating the user’s permissions against the attributes associated with each data set.</p>
          <p> Application Programming Interface (API) access: Public product APIs may be accessed using an API key
              or through authorization.</p>
          <p>ii) Preventing Unauthorized Product Use</p>
          <p> We implement industry standard access controls and detection capabilities for the internal networks
              that support its products.</p>
          <p> Access controls: Network access control mechanisms are designed to prevent network traffic using
              unauthorized protocols from reaching the product infrastructure. The technical measures implemented
              differ between infrastructure providers and include Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) implementations,
              security group assignment, and traditional firewall rules.</p>
          <p> Intrusion detection and prevention: We implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution to
              protect hosted customer websites and other internet-accessible applications. The WAF is designed to
              identify and prevent attacks against publicly available network services.</p>
          <p> Static code analysis: Code stored in our source code repositories is checked for best practices and
              identifiable software flaws using automated tooling.</p>
          <p>Penetration testing: We maintain relationships with industry-recognized penetration testing service
              providers for penetration testing of both the CrmOne web application and internal corporate network
              infrastructure at least annually. The intent of these penetration tests is to identify security
              vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk and business impact they pose to the in-scope systems.</p>
          <p>Bug bounty: A bug bounty program invites and incentives independent security researchers to ethically
              discover and disclose security flaws. We implement a bug bounty program in an effort to widen the
              available opportunities to engage with the security community and improve the product defenses
              against sophisticated attacks.</p>
          <p> iii) Limitations of Privilege &amp; Authorization Requirements</p>
          <p> Product access: A subset of our employees have access to the products and to customer data via
              controlled interfaces. The intent of providing access to a subset of employees is to provide
              effective customer support, product development and research, to troubleshoot potential problems, to
              detect and respond to security incidents and implement data security. Access is enabled through
              “just in time” (JITA) requests for access; all such requests are logged. Employees are granted
              access by role, and reviews of high risk privilege grants are initiated daily. Administrative or
              high risk access permissions are reviewed at least once every six months.</p>
          <p> Background checks: Where permitted by applicable law, CrmOne employees undergo a third-party
              background or reference checks. In the United States, employment offers are contingent upon the
              results of a third-party background check. All CrmOne employees are required to conduct themselves
              in a manner consistent with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical standards.
          </p>
          <p><strong> b) Transmission Control</strong></p>
          <p> In-transit: We require HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS) on all login interfaces and
              for free on every customer site hosted on the CrmOne products. Our HTTPS implementation uses
              industry standard algorithms and certificates.</p>
          <p> At-rest: We store user passwords following policies that follow industry standard practices for
              security. We have implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest. </p>
          <p><strong> c) Input Control</strong></p>
          <p> Detection: We designed our infrastructure to log extensive information about the system behavior,
              traffic received, system authentication, and other application requests. Internal systems aggregate
              log data and alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous activities. Our
              personnel, including security, operations, and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.
          </p>
          <p> Response and tracking: We maintain a record of known security incidents that includes description,
              dates and times of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and confirmed security
              incidents are investigated by security, operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution
              steps are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents, we will take appropriate steps to
              minimize product and Customer damage or unauthorized disclosure. Notification to you will be in
              accordance with the terms of the Agreement. </p>
          <p><strong> d) Availability Control</strong></p>
          <p> Infrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use commercially reasonable efforts to
              ensure a minimum of 99.95% uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to power,
              network, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) services.</p>
          <p> Fault tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure redundancy and fail-over
              protections during a significant processing failure. Customer data is backed up to multiple durable
              data stores and replicated across multiple availability zones.</p>
          <p> Online replicas and backups: Where feasible, production databases are designed to replicate data
              between no less than 1 primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and maintained
              using at least industry standard methods.</p>
          <p> Disaster Recovery Plans: We maintain and regularly test disaster recovery plans to help ensure
              availability of information following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes.
          </p>
          <p>Our products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless fail over. The server instances that
              support the products are also architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This
              design assists our operations in maintaining and updating the product applications and back end
              while limiting downtime.</p>

          <p>If you are using any CrmOne Service, this AUP applies to you. Every client of ours agrees to abide by
              this AUP and is responsible for any violations. You are not allowed to assist or engage others in a
              way that would violate this AUP. We will enforce and ensure compliance with this AUP by using
              methods we consider to be appropriate, such as complaint and email failure monitoring. We may also
              suspend or terminate your use of CrmOne Services pursuant to our Customer Terms of Service for
              violations of this AUP. </p>
          <p>We periodically update these terms and we will let you know when we do through the Notification app
              in the CrmOne portal used to access your CrmOne subscription (if you have one), or by posting a
              revised copy on our website. You agree to review the AUP on a regular basis and always remain in
              compliance.</p>
          <p class="content-title" id="usetab1">1. Reporting Suspected Violations</p>
          <p>We encourage recipients of email messages sent using the CrmOne Service to report suspected
              violations of this AUP to us by forwarding a copy of the received email with FULL headers to
              <a href="mailto:connect@crmone.com" class="content-link">connect@crmone.com.</a>  We have a policy to investigate all of these reports and to respond in the way
              we consider appropriate. </p>
          <p>If you know of or suspect a violation of this AUP, you will promptly notify us in writing of the
              known or suspected violation of this AUP.</p>
          <p class="content-title" id="usetab2">2. Prohibited Email Actions </p>
          <p>a. You may not use CrmOne to send spam. Spam can be in the form of bulk email or one to one
              commercial emails.</p>
          <p>Bulk email is spam when it is unsolicited. Unsolicited means the recipient has not granted verifiable
              permission for the message to be sent. Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger
              collection of messages that have substantively similar content.
              One-to-one commercial emails are spam when they violate CAN-SPAM. One-to-one commercial emails are
              also considered Spam if the data processed for purposes of sending that email is in scope of the
              General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) and you fail to provide notice to individuals and
              establish a lawful basis of processing.
          </p>
          <p>You may not use the CrmOne Service in any way (directly or indirectly) to send, transmit, handle,
              distribute or deliver: (a) spam in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act (referenced below) or any other
              law; (b) email to an address obtained via Internet harvesting methods or any surreptitious methods
              (e.g., scraping or harvesting); (c) email to an address that is incomplete, inaccurate and/or not
              updated for all applicable opt-out notifications, using best efforts and best practices in the
              industry, (d) commercial electronic messages in violation of Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation
              (referenced below), or (e) in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). </p>
          <p>b. You may not use any misleading or false names, addresses, email address, or subject line. </p>
          <p>Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the CrmOne Service may not: (a) use or contain invalid
              or forged headers; (b) use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names; (c) employ any technique
              to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the
              transmission path; (d) use other means of deceptive addressing; (e) use a third party’s internet
              domain name without their consent, or be relayed from or through a third party’s equipment without
              the third party’s permission; (f) contain false or misleading information in the subject line or
              otherwise contain false or misleading content; or (g) use our trademark(s), tagline(s), or logo(s)
              without our prior written consent and only then pursuant to our trademark usage guidelines.</p>
          <p>If you use email, we recommend that you adopt the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working
              Group Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP), which were created and agreed upon with
              collaborative input from both volume email senders and Internet Service Providers. The Sender Best
              Communications Practices document is available here. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to
              follow these practices.</p>
          <p>c. You may not email purchased lists. </p>
          <p>You are prohibited from using the CrmOne Service to email: (a) purchased, rented, or borrowed lists,
              and (b) lists that are likely to result in an excessive number of unsubscribe requests or Spam
              complaints or notices, as determined by acceptable industry practices.</p>
          <p class="content-title" id="usetab3">3. Email Opt-out Requirements </p>
          <p>You warrant that each email you send or is sent for you using the CrmOne Service will contain: (a)
              header information that is not false or misleading; and (b) an advisement that the recipient may
              unsubscribe, opt-out or otherwise demand that use of its information for unsolicited, impermissible
              and/or inappropriate communication(s) as described in this AUP be stopped (and how the recipient can
              notify you that it wants to unsubscribe, opt-out, or stop this use of its information). These
              requirements may not apply if the email sent is a transactional email and these requirements are not
              otherwise required by law. You warrant that you will promptly comply with all opt-out, unsubscribe,
              “do not call” and “do not send” requests.</p>
          <p class="content-title" id="usetab4">4. Telephone, SMS, and Message Marketing</p>
          <p>You must comply with all laws relating to telephone marketing, including without limitation those
              specifically referenced in the ‘Proper Usage of CrmOne Service’ section below. You must comply with
              all laws related to the recording of phone calls and ensure all proper consent to record is obtained
              prior to making any such recording. If you use the CrmOne Service to place telephone calls, you must
              also comply with all applicable industry standards, including those applicable guidelines published
              by the CTIA and the Mobile Marketing Association. You are prohibited from using or permitting access
              to use the CrmOne Service to make emergency calls or to provide or seek emergency services.</p>
          <p>You understand that you are required to comply with carrier compliance obligations and penalties in
              addition to these terms, which may have additional restrictions and requirements. </p>
          <p class="content-title" id="usetab5">5. No Disruption</p>
          <p><strong>You agree not to:</strong></p>
          <p>(a) use the CrmOne Service in a way that impacts the normal operation, privacy, integrity or security

              website(s), network(s), system(s), facilities, equipment, data, other information, or business
              operations;</p>
          <p>(b) use or launch any automated system, including, “robots,” “spiders,” or “offline readers,” that
              sends more request messages to our servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably
              produce in the same period by using a conventional browser (also for example, scraping or
              harvesting);</p>
          <p>(c) use the Subscription Service in any manner that damages, disables, overburdens, or impairs any of
              our websites or interferes with any other party’s use of the Subscription Service;</p>
          <p>(d) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Subscription Service; </p>

          <p>Examples of prohibited actions include (without limitation) include hacking, spoofing, denial of
              service, mailbombing and/or sending any email that contains or transmits any virus or propagating
              worm(s), or any malware, whether spyware, adware or other such file or program. </p>
          <p>These restrictions apply regardless of your intent and whether or not you act intentionally or
              unintentionally.</p>

          <p class="content-title">CrmOne Regional Data Hosting Policy</p>
          <p>Our CrmOne Regional Data Hosting Policy (“Policy”) explains where Customer Data will be hosted by
              CrmOne. This Policy sets out our commitment to hosting Customer Data in a specific location and the
              exceptions to that commitment. </p>
          <p>In 2021, we began offering a location specific regional data hosting service (“Regional Data
              Hosting”) to new customers as part of their subscription. New customers who purchase the
              Subscription Service after 2021, and who are located in Europe (including Switzerland and the United
              Kingdom), Russia, the Middle East and Africa will have their Customer Data hosted in Europe by
              default (based on your IP address on sign up) in accordance with this Policy. If your Order Form
              does not indicate a data hosting location, your Customer Data will be stored in the United States of
              America (“USA”).</p>
          <p>Any terms not defined in this Policy will have the same meaning as set out in the CrmOne Customer
              Terms of Service. In the event of a conflict between this Policy and the Agreement, this Policy will
              control. We may periodically update this Policy. We will post any changes on this page and, if the
              changes are material, we will provide an update through the notification app in your CrmOne account.
          </p>
          <p class="content-title">1. Regional Data Hosting Location and Customer Data</p>
          <p><strong>1.1 Definitions</strong></p>
          <p>“Location” means the region or geographic area where your Customer Data is primarily stored within
              our cloud infrastructure (e.g. North America or Europe). The location will be indicated on your
              Order Form and in your CrmOne account. If no Location is specified in your Order Form your Customer
              Data is hosted in the USA.</p>
          <p>“Exclusions” means the services and processing not covered by Regional Data Hosting Policy and which
              will continue outside of the Location, as described in the ‘Exclusions’ section below.</p>
          <p>1.2 If you purchase your Subscription Service after 2021, and you are located in Europe (including
              Switzerland and the United Kingdom), Russia, the Middle East and Africa (based on your IP address on
              sign up) we will store Customer Data within the Location for the duration of your Subscription Term
              in accordance with the terms of this Policy. You agree that for the purposes of the DPA, this Policy
              constitutes your Instructions in relation to the storage of Customer Data. The Location will be
              indicated on your Order Form. If no Location is specified in your Order Form your Customer Data will
              be hosted in the USA. Your Location will also be indicated in your CrmOne account. Your Customer
              Data will be replicated for disaster recovery and back-up purposes to other data centers within the
              Location. </p>
          <p>1.3 You understand and agree that while Customer Data will be primarily stored and processed in the
              Location: (i) CrmOne, Inc. is located in the USA and certain storage and processing may continue
              outside of the Location, including in the USA and other regions where we, our Affiliates and
              Sub-processors operate; (ii) we may change Sub-processors in order to provide the Subscription
              Service, in accordance with the DPA; (iii) Customer Data may be accessed outside of the Location if
              Users accessing the Subscription Service are located outside of Europe; (iv) except as otherwise
              agreed only Customer Data that was submitted or collected after Regional Data Hosting was included
              as part of your subscription will be stored in the Location; and (v) we make no warranty that
              Regional Data Hosting will meet your data residency requirements. Regional Data Hosting does not
              apply to the Exclusions, see the ‘Exclusions’ section below for further information. </p>
          <p>1.4 This Policy does not apply if you previously agreed to the CrmOne Regional Data Hosting Beta
              Terms. In that case, the terms in this Policy do not apply to you and the CrmOne Regional Data
              Hosting Beta Terms will continue to apply until either (i) your CrmOne account is migrated to the
              Location, or (ii) we notify you of the end of the CrmOne Regional Data Hosting Beta Program. The
              CrmOne Regional Data Hosting Beta Terms will then cease to apply and this Policy will apply. </p>
          <p class="content-title">2. Exclusions</p>
          <p>2.1 CrmOne Inc. is located in the USA and certain storage and processing may continue outside the
              Location, including in the USA and other regions where CrmOne, its Affiliates and Sub-Processors
              operate. Customer Data may be transferred and/or accessed outside the Location for the following
              Exclusions: </p>
          <p>(i) Customer and Product Development Support: In order to provide customer support and product
              development support, CrmOne employees from other office locations and Sub-Processors may access your
              CrmOne account and Customer Data. For example, we may access your CrmOne account if you call CrmOne
              Support and have a question about how to use a certain feature or to fix a bug. </p>
          <p>(ii) Security and Abuse Prevention: CrmOne employees from other office locations may access your
              CrmOne account and Customer Data to investigate or remediate security incidents and/or product
              abuse. </p>
          <p>(iii) Integration’s: If you choose to use integration’s that process Customer Data, those
              integration’s may process and/or store Customer Data in locations other than the Location. Before
              installing integration’s, you should investigate how data is being passed to these integration’s and
              where the data will be stored and/or processed. You are responsible for any integration’s you use in
              conjunction with your CrmOne account.</p>
          <p>(iv) User Access: Your Users may log in to your CrmOne account from areas outside of the Location.
              This means that data may be accessed and transferred from the User’s location. User access is your
              responsibility.</p>
          <p>(v) Usage Data: As described in the ‘Customer Data’ section of the Customer Terms of Service, we may
              collect data about how you use and interact with the Subscription Service. This usage data will be
              transferred from the Location to the USA. </p>
          <p>(vi) Sub-Processors: CrmOne uses Sub-Processors to provide the Subscription Service and Consulting
              Services. These Sub-Processors may have access to or process Customer Data (which may contain
              Personal Data). As a CrmOne Customer, your Customer Data will be stored and processed by these
              Sub-Processors within the Location, except for those listed in the table below. </p>
          <p>You can review the list of Sub-Processors in Annex 3 of the DPA. You may choose to not use certain
              features or integration’s supported by the Sub-Processors included in the table below. If you wish
              to use the features or integration’s supported by these Sub-Processors, you acknowledge your
              Customer Data will be processed and/or stored outside of the Location. </p>
