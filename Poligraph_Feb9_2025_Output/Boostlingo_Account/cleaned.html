Unless otherwise noted in the Order Form, LSP shall pay all invoices by bank wire transfer, ACH bank transfer, or credit card within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of Boostlingo’s invoice, notwithstanding any payment or non-payment by Customer or LSPs.

LSP agrees to provide such financial information regarding LSP and any of its Partners from time to time as may be reasonably requested by Boostlingo to verify the creditworthiness of LSP and any of its Partners. A late payment charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum allowed by law, shall be assessed on all overdue amounts. LSP shall reimburse Boostlingo’s costs of collection including, but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees.

All claims must be submitted to Boostlingo in writing within sixty (60) days from the date of the invoice for those Products.

If the dispute is resolved against LSP, LSP shall pay such amounts plus interest at the rate referenced in Section 7.2.

During the Term of this Agreement, each party may disclose to the other certain Confidential Information to the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (a) is known to the Receiving Party prior to receipt hereunder from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, (b) becomes lawfully known (independently of disclosure by the Disclosing Party) to the Receiving Party from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, (c) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be secret or confidential, except through a breach of this Agreement, or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information.</p><p class="nitro-offscreen">10.2 Protection of Confidential Information. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Receiving Party will not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent, except disclosure to and subsequent uses by the Receiving Party’s employees or consultants on a need-to-know basis, provided that such employees or consultants have executed written agreements restricting use or disclosure of such Confidential Information that are at least as restrictive as the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Section. Subject to the foregoing nondisclosure and non-use obligations, the Receiving Party agrees to use at least the same care and precaution in protecting such Confidential Information as the Receiving Party uses to protect the Receiving Party’s own Confidential Information and trade secrets, and in no event less than reasonable care. The receiving party is prohibited from using the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to develop, make or market products or services that are or may be competitive with the products or services of the disclosing Party. Each Party acknowledges that due to the unique nature of the other Party’s Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will not have an adequate remedy in money or damages in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information. In addition to any other remedies that may be available in law, in equity or otherwise, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent such unauthorized use or disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LSP’s obligations will survive any termination of this Agreement or LSP’s relationship with Boostlingo.</p><p class="nitro-offscreen">10.3 Return or Destruction of Materials. All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information that have been disclosed by either Party to the other Party, and all summaries, copies, descriptions, excerpts or extracts thereof that are in the possession of the other Party, shall be and remain the property of the Disclosing Party and shall be promptly returned to the Disclosing Party, and the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to promptly delete or destroy all summaries, copies, descriptions, excerpts or extracts thereof in their possession upon the Disclosing Party’s written request. The Receiving Party shall have no obligation to delete or destroy copies that: (a) are contained in an archived computer system backup that was made in accordance with such Party’s security, e-mail retention, and/or disaster recovery procedures; or (b) are kept by a Party for record-keeping, archival, or governance purposes in compliance with such Party’s document retention policies. Any such retained Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for so long as it is retained. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will continue to be bound by its confidentiality and other obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. At the Disclosing Party’s option, the Receiving Party will provide written certification of its compliance with this Section.</p><p class="nitro-offscreen"><strong>11 INDEMNIFICATION.</strong></p><p class="nitro-offscreen">11.1 BOOSTLINGO INDEMNIFICATION. Boostlingo shall defend or settle any suit or action against LSP based on a claim that the Product, to the extent provided by Boostlingo and not modified by LSP, Customer or their respective agents, infringes any third party’s U.S. or Canadian patent or copyright; provided, that (a) LSP gives Boostlingo prompt written notice of any claim, action or suit, sole authority to defend or settle as it sees fit, and full cooperation, and (b) Boostlingo is not obligated to indemnify or defend LSP or settle such claim, action or suit if the primary basis of the infringement arises out of (i) modification of the Product by anyone other than Boostlingo, (ii) combination of the Product with freeware, shareware or other third party software, or (iii) use of the Product for other than its intended purpose. If LSP or Customer is prevented from using any Product provided by Boostlingo due to claims of infringement of any U.S. or Canadian patent or copyright, Boostlingo may, at its expense: (i) procure the right to continue using the Product; (ii) modify the Product so that it is non-infringing; or (iii) procure a replacement product that has substantially the same functionality.

The foregoing indemnification obligation of LSP is contingent upon Boostlingo promptly notifying LSP in writing of such claim (provided the failure or delay in doing so shall not relieve LSP from any obligations to indemnify Boostlingo except to the extent that such delay or failure materially prejudices the defense of such claim), permitting LSP sole authority to control the defense or settlement of such claim, provided that LSP may not settle any such claim unless it unconditionally releases Boostlingo of all liability, and providing LSP reasonable assistance (at LSP’s sole expense) in connection therewith.</p><p class="nitro-offscreen"><strong>12 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES &amp; DISCLAIMER.</strong></p><p class="nitro-offscreen">12.1 LSP’s Representation &amp; Warranty.
