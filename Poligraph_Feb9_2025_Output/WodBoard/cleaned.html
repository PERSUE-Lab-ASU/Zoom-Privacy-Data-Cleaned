Please read this privacy policy carefully as it contains important information about our use of your information. It explains what information we collect about you, and how we use it, including when we might disclose it to third parties.</span></p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">1.3 This document makes reference to the GDPR, an EU law that has been adopoted by the UK as part of its withdrawal from the EU.  References to GDPR throughout this document refer to both the EU and UK laws.</span></p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">1.4 In addition to this privacy policy we provide a <a href="/legal/dpa">Data Processing Addendum (DPA)</a> for businesses that use the service.

        <p class="p7"><span class="s1"><strong>2. What information does WodBoard collect?</strong></span></p>

We also collect a name, address, legal entity name and VAT number from business customers. We will process your information on the basis that you registered an account and thereafter have given us your explicit consent.</span></p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.2 If you use the WodBoard Android or Apple app we store information about the device you are using.  We may also be informed of location data if you enable this option (see section 3 for details).</span></p>

        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">3.1 When using the WodBoard app for Android and Apple devices, you can opt to turn on location tracking.

This may happen in the background if you don't have the WodBoard app open and have approved background location tracking.</span></p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">3.2 We are only notified of your location when you are within a certain distance of a gym you're a member of ("a geofence").
