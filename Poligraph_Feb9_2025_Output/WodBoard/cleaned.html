Please read this privacy policy carefully as it contains important information about our use of your information. It explains what information we collect about you, and how we use it, including when we might disclose it to third parties.</span></p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">1.3 This document makes reference to the GDPR, an EU law that has been adopoted by the UK as part of its withdrawal from the EU.  References to GDPR throughout this document refer to both the EU and UK laws.</span></p>
        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">1.4 In addition to this privacy policy we provide a <a href="/legal/dpa">Data Processing Addendum (DPA)</a> for businesses that use the service.

        <p class="p7"><span class="s1"><strong>2. What information does WodBoard collect?</strong></span></p>

        <p class="p3"><span class="s1">3.2 We are only notified of your location when you are within a certain distance of a gym you're a member of ("a geofence").
