                                    Maestra and its service providers. If you do not reside in the U.S., laws
                                    in the U.S. (and other countries) may differ from the laws where you reside.
                                    By using the Service, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you,
                                    regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is
                                    being provided to Maestra in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers,
                                    and you authorize Maestra to transfer, store, host and process your information
                                    to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. You hereby consent to
                                    transfer of your data to the U.S. pursuant to either, at Maestra’s discretion,
                                    the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, the details of which
                                    are further set forth below, or the standard data protection clauses promulgated
                                    by the European Commission, a copy of which can be obtained at <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32010D0087" rel="nofollow">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32010D0087</a>.</p>

                                    the Service through an enterprise account, or other Maestra account that
                                    is controlled by a third party (e.g. your employer).</p>

                                        to us, when third parties such as our business partners (e.g. companies
                                        with whom we integrate our Service), service providers (such as our advertising
                                        service providers) provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal
                                        Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of
                                        our Service. We collect the following Personal Data from you in connection
                                        with the Service:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong><span>&nbsp;information we collect to identify or contact you, we collect typical “business card information” such as your first and last name, physical address, email address, telephone number, or Twitter handle. For example, this is the basic information that we collect when you register for our flagship design and prototyping Service.</span>

                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Financial Account Information:</strong><span>&nbsp;information that you provide in connection with your purchase of the Service (or a purchase made through the Service), including credit card number, credit card expiration date, credit card verification code, bank account number, bank account title, bank name, branch location, and routing number.

                                        <li><strong>Transaction Information:</strong><span>&nbsp;information related to transactions you conduct on the Service, including when you register for a webinar, event or download special content, and your interactions with the Service (for example the functionality you use and the links clicked on the Service).</span>

                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>User Account Information:</strong><span></span> information that

                                            and IP address. For example, we use this information to authenticate you
                                            when you log in to the Service, and use the IP address to help maintain

                                        <li><strong>User Content:</strong>  <span>to the extent that you choose to input Personal Data as part of such content, images, comments, and other content, information, and materials that you post to or through the Service.</span>

                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>We also may collect usage and performance information that is not Personal
                                        Data or that we aggregate or de-identify so that it no longer personally
                                        identifies an individual. We also associate some data that is not Personal
                                        Data with Personal Data.</p>
                                    <p>We may collect Personal Data when a user (i) creates an account (a “User
                                        Account”); (ii) logs into the Service; (iii) interacts with the Service;
                                        (iv) uploads or generates User Content; (v) communicates with us; and (vi)
                                        responds to a communication or interaction from us. Some of the methods
                                        and tools we use to collect Personal Data are:</p>
                                    <p><strong>Unique Identifiers:</strong> We may use unique identifiers such
                                        as cookies, e-mail or your pseudonymized customer ID to track individual
                                        usage behavior on our Service, such as the length of time spent on a particular
                                        page and the pages viewed during a particular log-in period. Unique identifiers
                                        collect information about a user’s use of our Service on an individual
                                        basis.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Mobile Device Identifiers:</strong> Mobile device identifiers are
                                        identifiers stored on your mobile device that track certain data and activities
                                        occurring on or through your device. Mobile device identifiers enable collection
                                        of Personal Data (such as media access controls) as well as non-personally
                                        identifiable information (such as usage and traffic data).</p>
                                    <p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Tracking Tools:</strong> We and
                                        our third party service providers may collect information about you, your

                                            (an “Enterprise Account”) or a potential enterprise Service purchaser (for
                                            example, your employer’s) (each, an “E-Mail Holder”), we may provide your
                                            name and email address to the E-Mail Holder and their administrator. In

                                            for your individual User Account. We make these transfers to allow users
