For example, we may collect:</p><p>(a) information about the features you use and the pages you view on the European Services;</p><p>(b) information about your device (such as your IP address, device identifier, device type, model and manufacturer); and</p><p>(c) information about your usage patterns (such as how often you use the Transcend European Services and your language settings).</p><p>We use this information to provide you the features and functionality of the European Services, to monitor and improve the European Services and to develop new services.</p><p>The table at <a href=\"https://privacy.transcend.io/policies?name=privacy-policy#annex-2-personal-information-collected-automatically\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Annex 2</strong></a> sets out further information about the categories of personal information we collect about you automatically and how we use that information.

We may use anonymised information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving the Transcend European Services. We may also share such anonymised and aggregated information with others.</p><p>We will usually store the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out in Annex 1 and Annex 2, in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.</p><p>The criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Legitimate Interests. </strong>Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consent. </strong>Where we are processing personal information based on your consent, we generally will retain the information until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contract. </strong>Where we are processing personal information based on contract, we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal Obligation. </strong>Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfill the legal obligation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal Claim.</strong> We may need to apply a \u201clegal hold\u201d that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim.
