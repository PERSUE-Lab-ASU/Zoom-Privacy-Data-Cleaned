You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data.

Your rights relating to your Personal Data\n\n\n\nBy law you have the right to:\n\n\n\n\nRequest access to your Personal Data. This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n\n\n\nRequest correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.\n\n\n\nRequest erasure of your Personal Data.

You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).\n\n\n\nObject to processing of your Personal Data. This right exists where we are relying on a Legitimate Interest as the legal basis for our processing and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.\n\n\n\nRequest the restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.\n\n\n\nRequest the transfer of your Personal Data.

Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, except in relation to Consent Withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\n\n\n5.
