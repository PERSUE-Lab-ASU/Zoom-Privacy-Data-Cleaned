<p class="wp-block-paragraph">By law you have the right to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Request access to your Personal Data. This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">Request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">Object to processing of your Personal Data. This right exists where we are relying on a Legitimate Interest as the legal basis for our processing and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">Request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">Request the transfer of your Personal Data. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">Withdraw consent. This right only exists where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data (“Consent Withdrawal”). If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to the certain specific functionalities of our Site. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
</ul>



<span id="ib-toc-anchor-3"></span><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-how-to-exercise-your-rights-">4. <strong>How to exercise your rights</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">If you want to exercise any of the rights described above, please email us at:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@appomni.com">privacy@appomni.com</a>&nbsp;or call at +1-415-799-1324. Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, except in relation to Consent Withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">We also collect, use and share “Aggregated Data” such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your Personal Data, but once in aggregated form it will not constitute considered Personal Data for the purposes of the GDPR as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it as listed below, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>



<span id="ib-toc-anchor-9"></span><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-what-is-our-%E2%80%9Clegal-basis%E2%80%9D-for-processing-your-personal-data-">10. <strong>What is our “legal basis” for processing your Personal Data?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal Data, the GDPR and other applicable privacy laws require us to ensure that we have a “legal basis” for that use. Most commonly, we will rely on one of the following legal bases:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Where we need to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (“Contractual Necessity”).</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (“Legitimate Interests”).
