The provider of this integrated third-party service may receive certain relevant data about or from your account on the Services or share certain relevant data from your account on the third-party provider\u2019s service with our Services, depending on the nature and purpose of such integration. This could include your Customer Data and/or personal data contained in Customer Data. Note that we may receive or store your passwords or API keys for any of these third-party services to integrate with them.</p>\n<p><em>Sharing personal data with our Customers</em>: In providing the Services, Torii acts as a data processor, processing Customer Data on behalf of our Customers, who are the data controllers. This delineation of roles means that our Customers are primarily responsible for the security, integrity, and authorized use of Customer Data within the context of the Services. Furthermore, it is the Customer\u2019s obligation to secure all necessary consents, permissions, and to provide any requisite data subject rights notices and fair processing declarations essential for the collection and utilization of such Customer Data. Our engagement with Customers is defined by a contractual relationship whereby Customers may, at their sole discretion, upload, add, input, transfer, and/or receive information, including personal data, to the platform (\u201c<strong>Customer Data</strong>\u201d).
