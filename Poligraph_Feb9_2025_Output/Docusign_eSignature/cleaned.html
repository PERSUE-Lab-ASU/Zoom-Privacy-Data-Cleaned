By using our Services, you understand that we will collect and use your personal information as described in this Privacy Notice.</p><p>In some cases, we may process your personal information pursuant to an agreement with a third-party organization. In those cases, the terms of that agreement may govern how we process your personal information. If you believe a third-party organization has asked us to process your personal information on their behalf, please consult with them in the first instance, as they will be responsible for how we process your information. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) does not apply to any third-party websites and apps that you may use, including those to which we link in our Services. You should review the terms and policies for third-party websites and apps before clicking on any links.</p><p>Docusign’s core product and Services help users create, complete, and show the validity of digital or electronic transactions, such as electronically signing a contract for mobile phone services or placing a digital signature on a loan application. As part of our Services, users want us to collect and record information that helps the parties prove the validity of the transactions, such as the names of the persons who are involved in the transactions and the devices those persons use.</p><p>We recommend that you read this Notice in full to ensure you are fully informed about the way we collect, use, store, or otherwise process your personal information as well as your privacy rights.

If you use any of our chat features we may use to communicate with you, we may collect personal information you voluntarily provide during your interactions, such as your name, email address, contact details, or any other information you choose to share and retain a transcript of your chats for the purposes set forth in this Notice.</p></li></ul><p><b>Personal Information We Collect Automatically.</b> We may automatically collect personal information from you and your devices when you use our Services, including when you visit our websites or apps without logging in.

This may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p><ul class="css-pp6kmm eupvb554"><li><p><b>Device Data</b>. This includes IP address, unique device identifiers, and device attributes, such as operating system and browser type.</p></li><li><p><b>Usage Data.</b> This includes web log data, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date(s) and time(s) you used our Services, the frequency of your use of our Services, error logs, and other related information.</p></li><li><p><b>Transactional Data.</b> This includes IP addresses and authentication methods of parties to a transaction, subject line, history of actions that individuals take in connection with a transaction (e.g., review, sign, enable features), and information about those parties’ devices.</p></li><li><p><b>Marketing and Advertising Data.</b> This includes your interests based on your use of our Services and other websites and online services, preferences in relation to receiving marketing materials from us, communication preferences, and your preferences for particular products and services.</p></li></ul><p>Some of the information we collect automatically is captured using cookies, which are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded on your device or related technologies, such as web beacons, local shared objects, and tracking pixels, to collect and/or store information. For additional information about cookies and related technologies, including details of how to opt-out, please read our Cookies Notice (<a href="https://www.docusign.com/company/cookie-policy"><u>https://www.docusign.com/company/cookie-policy</u></a>) and “Your Privacy Rights and Choices” below.</p><p><b>Personal Information We Collect from Other Sources.</b>&nbsp;Subject to applicable law, we may collect personal information about you from others, such as:</p><ul class="css-pp6kmm eupvb554"><li><p><b>Third-Party Sources.</b>&nbsp;Examples of third-party sources include marketers, partners, researchers, affiliates (companies under common ownership or control of Docusign), service providers, and others where they are legally allowed to share your personal information with us. For example, if you register for our Services on another website, the website may provide your personal information to us.</p></li><li><p><b>Other Customers.</b>&nbsp;Other customers may give us your personal information. For example, if a customer wants you to sign an electronic document in our Services, he or she will give us your email address and name.</p></li><li><p><b>Combining Personal Information from Different Sources.</b>&nbsp;We may combine the personal information we receive from other sources with personal information we collect from you (or your device) and use it as described in this Notice.</p></li></ul><p><b>Personal Information We Collect &amp; Process on Behalf of Customers.</b>&nbsp;When our business customers use certain Services, we generally process and store limited personal information on their behalf as a data processor. For example, in the context of Docusign eSignature, when a customer uploads contracts or other documents for review or signature, we act as a data processor and process the documents on the customer's behalf and in accordance with their instructions. In those instances, the customer is the data controller and is responsible for most aspects of the processing of the personal information.&nbsp; For certain products such as Docusign’s Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) and Identity products, we may act as a processor and as a controller in certain circumstances (e.g., retention of transactional data to comply with Docusign’s legal obligations).&nbsp; If you have any questions or concerns about how personal information is processed in these cases, including how to exercise your rights as a data subject, you should contact the customer (either your employer or the individual or entity requesting your signature). If we receive any rights requests concerning instances where we act as a data processor, we will forward your query on to the relevant customer.</p><h2 id="2">2. Use of Personal Information and Lawful Bases for Processing </h2><p>In general, and subject to applicable law, we will use your personal information to provide, maintain, and improve our Services, develop new Services, and market our Docusign products and Services. Please see the section below entitled "Further Information on the Personal Information We Process and Our Purposes," which provides more specific information on these purposes, examples of the types of information processed for these purposes, and the lawful bases (i.e., legal grounds) on which we rely to process it.</p><p><b>Lawful Basis for Processing Your Personal Information</b>. If applicable data protection law requires a lawful basis for processing, and where Docusign acts as a data controller, our lawful basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Notice will depend on the type of personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect or use it.</p><p>We normally collect or use personal information only where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect or retain personal information or may need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. In certain circumstances, we may ask for your consent (separately from any contract between us) before we collect, use, or disclose your personal data.&nbsp;</p><p>If we process sensitive personal information about you, as well as ensuring that one of the lawful bases referenced above applies, we will make sure that one or more of the grounds for processing sensitive personal information applies.</p><p>Note that in situations where Docusign acts as a processor, it is our customer who determines the appropriate legal basis associated with processing activities, and queries about the applicable lawful basis should be directed to them.</p><p><b>Further Information on the Personal Information We Process and Our Purposes&nbsp;</b></p><p>The table below provides more specific information on our purposes, the types of information that may be processed, and the legal bases on which we process it. The examples provided in the table cannot, of course, be exhaustive.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, there may be other applicable lawful bases for processing your personal information that are not listed here.

Where such information has been aggregated and anonymized so that it is no longer considered personal information under applicable data protection law, this Notice does not apply.</p><p><b>AI Model Training. </b>AI models must be trained in order to perform accurately. Through training, an AI model learns to recognize patterns and make predictions. Docusign has implemented role-based access controls and technical and organizational security measures to help minimize the privacy impact to individuals when we train our AI models. We intentionally design our systems with functionality to avoid training models using personal information that customers may enter into our Services (except when we have consent from a customer to do so). Docusign is committed to developing our Services that involve AI technology in accordance with our <a href="https://www.docusign.com/ai/innovation-principles">AI Innovation Principles.</a></p><h2 id="3">3.
