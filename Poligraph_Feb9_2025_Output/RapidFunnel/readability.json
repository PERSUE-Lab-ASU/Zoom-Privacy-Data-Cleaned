That information may include either your or your Contacts\u2019 name, picture/photo, physical address, email address, IP address, phone number, credit card information, as well as details including gender, occupation, location, purchase history, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to this information being collected, used, disclosed, transferred to the United States and stored by us, as described in our <a href=\"https://rapidfunnel.com/terms-conditions/\">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(b) <strong>Information we collect automatically:</strong> When you use the Services or browse one of our Websites, we may collect information about your visit to our Websites, your usage of the Services, and your web browsing. That information may include your IP address, your operating system, your browser ID, your browsing activity, and other information about how you interacted with our Websites or other websites. We may collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed more below, and in more detail in our Cookie Statement here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(c) <strong>List and email information:</strong> When you add a Contact or create a Contact with the Services, we have and may access the data on your list for internal use ONLY. We will never sell or share your contact data with any third party except for our direct clients or reasons that are instrumental to the proper functionality of the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(d) <strong>Information from your use of the Service:</strong> We may receive information about how and when you use the Services, store it in log files or other types of files associated with your account, and link it to other information we collect about you. This information may include, for example, your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions you have taken within the application. This type of information helps us to improve our Services for both you and for all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(e) <strong>Cookies and tracking:</strong> We and our partners may use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, and this may include using cookies and similar tracking technologies on our Website, such as pixels and web beacons, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users\u2019 movements around the website, serve targeted advertisements, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website or to manage and serve our advertising on other sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(f) <strong>Web beacons:</strong> We use web beacons on our Websites and in our emails. When we send emails to Users, we may track behavior such as who opened the emails and who clicked the links. This allows us to measure the performance of our email campaigns and to improve our features for specific segments of Users. To do this, we include single pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when an email is opened, the IP address, the browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create reports about how your email campaign performed and what actions your Contacts took. Reports are also available to us when we send email to you, so we may collect and review that information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(g) <strong>Information from other sources:</strong> From time to time we may obtain information about you or your Contacts from third party sources, such as public databases, social media platforms, third party data providers and our joint marketing partners. We take steps to ensure that such third parties are legally permitted or required to disclose such information to us. Examples of the information we may receive from other sources include: demographic information, device information (such as IP addresses), location, and online behavioral data (such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links). We use this information, alone or in combination with other information (including Personal Information) we collect, to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing and content to you and to develop and provide you with more relevant products features, and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(h) <strong>Information from the use of our Mobile Apps:</strong> When you use our mobile apps, we may collect certain information in addition to information described elsewhere in this Policy. For example, we may collect information about the type of device and operating system you use. We may ask you if you want to receive push notifications about activity in your account. If you have opted in to these notifications and no longer want to receive them, you may turn them off through your operating system or through the in-app settings. We may use mobile analytics software to better understand how people use our application. We may collect information about how often you use the application and other performance data.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We may use and disclose Personal Information only for the following purposes:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(a) <strong>To promote use of our services to you and others.</strong>&nbsp;For example, if we collect your Personal Information when you visit our Website and do not sign up for any of the Services, we may send you an email inviting you to sign up. If you use any of our Services and we think you might benefit from using another Service we offer, we may send you an email about that. You can stop receiving our promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in every email we send. In addition, we may use information we collect in order to advertise our Services to you or suggest additional features of our Services that you might consider using. In addition, we may use your Personal Information to advertise our Services to potential or other users like you.

We use third parties for secure credit card transaction processing, and we send billing information to those third parties to process your orders and credit card payments. To learn more about the steps we take to safeguard that data, see Section 14 below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(d) <strong>To send you System Alert messages.</strong>&nbsp;For example, we may inform you of temporary or permanent changes to our Services, such as planned outages, new features, version updates, releases, abuse warnings, and changes to our Privacy Policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(e) <strong>To communicate with our Users about their account and provide customer support.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>(f) <strong>To enforce compliance with our Terms of Use and applicable law.</strong>&nbsp;This may include developing tools and algorithms that help us prevent violations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(g) <strong>To protect the rights and safety of our Users and third parties, as well as our own.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>(h) <strong>To meet legal requirements,</strong>&nbsp;including complying with court orders, valid discovery requests, valid subpoenas, and other appropriate legal mechanisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(i) <strong>To provide information to representatives and advisors</strong>, including attorneys and accountants, to help us comply with legal, accounting, or security requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(j) <strong>To prosecute and defend a court, arbitration, or similar legal proceeding.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>(k) <strong>To respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>(l) <strong>To provide, support, and improve the Services we offer.</strong>&nbsp;This includes our use of the data that our Users provide us in order to enable our Users to use the Services to communicate with their Contacts. This also includes, for example, aggregating information from your use of the Services or visit to our Websites and sharing this information with third parties to improve our Services. This might also include sharing your information or the information you provide us about your Contacts with third parties in order to provide and support our Services or to make certain features of the Services available to you. Specifically, we may share the Contact information with the company our Users work with or for in order to improve the services we offer. When we do have to share Personal Information with third parties, we take steps to protect your information by requiring these third parties to enter into a contract with us that requires them to use the Personal Information we transfer to them in a manner that is consistent with this policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(m) <strong>To provide suggestions to you.</strong>&nbsp;This includes adding features that compare Users\u2019 email campaigns, using data to suggest other publishers your Contacts may be interested in, or using data to suggest products or services that you may be interested in or that may be relevant to you or your Contacts. Some of these suggestions are generated by use of our Data Science Projects. For more information about our use of cookies and other tracking technologies for this purpose, and instructions about how to opt out of having data collected through the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Statement here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(n) <strong>To transfer your information</strong>&nbsp;in the case of a sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganization, or acquisition.

When we combine Personal Information with other information in this way, we treat it as, and apply all of the safeguards in this Privacy Policy applicable to, Personal Information.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Data Collected for and by our Users</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you use our Services, you may import into our system Personal Information you have collected from your Contacts or other individuals. We have no direct relationship with your Contacts or any person other than you, and for that reason, you are responsible for making sure you have the appropriate permission for us to collect and process information about those individuals. Your contact list and all of your contact data will be stored on our servers in order to provide cross platform accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistent with the uses of Personal Information covered in Section 6, we may transfer Personal Information of you or your Contacts to companies that help us promote, provide, or support our Services or the services of our Users (\u201cService Providers\u201d). All Service Providers enter into a contract with us that protects Personal Information and restricts their use of any Personal Information consistent with this policy. As part of our Services, we may use and incorporate into features information you have provided, we have collected from you, or we have collected about Contacts. We may share this information, including Contact email addresses, with third parties in line with the approved uses in Section 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a Contact and no longer want to be contacted by one of our Users, please unsubscribe directly from that User\u2019s newsletter or contact the User directly to update or delete your data. If you contact us, we may remove or update your information within a reasonable time and after providing notice to the User of your request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will retain Personal Information we process on behalf of our Users for as long as needed to provide our Services or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>Public Information and Third Party Websites</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>(a) Blog.

If we are unable to remove your information, we will tell you why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(b) Social media platforms and widgets. Our Websites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Website, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. We also maintain presences on social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Any information, communications, or materials you submit to us via a social media platform is done at your own risk without any expectation of privacy. We cannot control the actions of other users of these platforms or the actions of the platforms themselves. Your interactions with those features and platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(c) Links to third-party websites. Our Websites include links to other websites, whose privacy practices may be different from ours. If you submit Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Website you visit.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>Third Parties</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information to the following types of third parties for the purposes described in this policy:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(a) Service Providers. Sometimes, we share your information with our third party Service Providers, who help us provide and support our Services. For example, if it is necessary to provide you something you have requested (like enable a feature such as Social Profiles), then we may share your and/or your Contacts\u2019 Personal Information with a Service Provider for that purpose. Just like with the other third parties we work with, these third party Service Providers enter into a contract that requires them to use your Personal Information only for the provision of services to us and in a manner that is consistent with this policy. Examples of Service Providers include payment processors, hosting services and content delivery services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(b) Advertising partners. We may partner with third party advertising networks and exchanges to display advertising on our Websites or to manage and serve our advertising on other sites and may share Personal Information with them for this purpose. All third parties with which we share this information are required to use your Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. We and our third party partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as pixels and web beacons, to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to provide you with targeted advertising based on your browsing activities and interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(c) Parent companies.&nbsp; Our Users typically are part of a \u201cParent Company\u201d, which is a company that they work with or for.&nbsp; We share information about these User\u2019s contacts with their respective Parent Companies in order to improve our services and provide them with data to improve the content they provide to their Users.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong>Contest and Sweepstakes</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We may, from time to time, offer surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions on our Websites or through social media (collectively \u201cOur Promotions\u201d). Participation in our Promotions is completely voluntary. Information requested for entry may include personal contact information such as your name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address, username, and similar details. We use the information you provide to administer Our Promotions. We may also, unless prohibited by the Promotion\u2019s rules or law, use the information provided to communicate with you, or other people you select, about our Services. We may share this information with our affiliates and other organizations or Service Providers in line with this policy and the rules posted for the Promotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li><strong>Content of Email &amp; Campaigns</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When you send content via email, it bounces from server to server as it crosses the Internet. Along the way, server administrators can read what you send. Email was not built for confidential information. Please do not use RapidFunnel to send confidential information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we review the content of our Users\u2019 email campaigns to make sure they comply with our Terms of Use. To improve that process, we have software that helps us find email campaigns that may violate our Terms. Our employees or independent contractors may review those particular email campaigns. This benefits all Users who comply with our Terms of Use because it reduces the amount of spam being sent through our servers and helps us maintain high deliverability.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li><strong>Your Information and Contacts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We acknowledge your ownership rights to all your contacts and information. We will never, under any circumstances, sell or rent your contact lists to anyone without your permission. Your Contact Lists are stored on a secure RapidFunnel server. If someone on your Contact List complains or contacts us, we might then contact that person/Contact. Only authorized employees have access to view Contact Lists. You may export (download) your Contact Lists from RapidFunnel at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will use and disclose the information in your Contact Lists only for the reasons discussed in Sections 6-9. We will not use and disclose the information in your Contact Lists to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>bill or collect money owed to us;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>send you system alert messages;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>communicate with you about your account; or</li>\n\n\n\n<li>send you informational and promotional content.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h5 id=\"security\"><strong>SECURITY</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li><strong>Notice of Breach of Security</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that materially affects you or people on your Distribution Lists, then RapidFunnel will notify you as soon as possible and later report the action we took in response.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"14\">\n<li><strong>Safeguarding Your Information</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our credit card processing vendor uses security measures to protect your information both during the transaction and after it is complete. Our vendor is certified as compliant with card association security initiatives, including the Visa Cardholder Information Security and Compliance (CISP), MasterCard\u00ae (SDP), and Discovery Information Security and Compliance (DISC). If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rapidfunnel.com/contact\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RapidFunnel accounts require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Because the information in your Contact Lists are so sensitive, account passwords are encrypted, which means we cannot see your passwords. We cannot resend forgotten passwords either. We will only reset them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5 id=\"compliance\"><strong>COMPLIANCE</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"15\">\n<li><strong>We Operate in the United States</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Our servers and offices are located in the United States, so your information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States. While the data protection, privacy, and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take many steps to protect your privacy, including offering a data processing addendum. By using our Websites, you understand and consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information to our facilities in the United States and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"16\">\n<li><strong>Accuracy and Retention of Data</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do so. If your data changes (for example, if you have a new email address), then you are responsible for notifying us of those changes. Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you with our Services. We may also retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our Agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"17\">\n<li><strong>Access</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We will give an individual, either a User or a Contact, access to any Personal Information we hold about them within 30 days of any request for that information. Individuals may request to access, correct, amend or delete information we hold about them by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rapidfunnel.com/contact\">contacting us here</a>.

That information may include either your or your Contacts\u2019 name, picture/photo, physical address, email address, IP address, phone number, credit card information, as well as details including gender, occupation, location, purchase history, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to this information being collected, used, disclosed, transferred to the United States and stored by us, as described in our Terms of Use\u00a0and in this Privacy Policy.\n\n\n\n(b) Information we collect automatically: When you use the Services or browse one of our Websites, we may collect information about your visit to our Websites, your usage of the Services, and your web browsing. That information may include your IP address, your operating system, your browser ID, your browsing activity, and other information about how you interacted with our Websites or other websites. We may collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed more below, and in more detail in our Cookie Statement here.\n\n\n\n(c) List and email information: When you add a Contact or create a Contact with the Services, we have and may access the data on your list for internal use ONLY. We will never sell or share your contact data with any third party except for our direct clients or reasons that are instrumental to the proper functionality of the app.\n\n\n\n(d) Information from your use of the Service: We may receive information about how and when you use the Services, store it in log files or other types of files associated with your account, and link it to other information we collect about you. This information may include, for example, your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions you have taken within the application. This type of information helps us to improve our Services for both you and for all of our users.\n\n\n\n(e) Cookies and tracking: We and our partners may use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, and this may include using cookies and similar tracking technologies on our Website, such as pixels and web beacons, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users\u2019 movements around the website, serve targeted advertisements, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website or to manage and serve our advertising on other sites.\n\n\n\n(f) Web beacons: We use web beacons on our Websites and in our emails. When we send emails to Users, we may track behavior such as who opened the emails and who clicked the links. This allows us to measure the performance of our email campaigns and to improve our features for specific segments of Users. To do this, we include single pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when an email is opened, the IP address, the browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create reports about how your email campaign performed and what actions your Contacts took. Reports are also available to us when we send email to you, so we may collect and review that information.\n\n\n\n(g) Information from other sources: From time to time we may obtain information about you or your Contacts from third party sources, such as public databases, social media platforms, third party data providers and our joint marketing partners. We take steps to ensure that such third parties are legally permitted or required to disclose such information to us. Examples of the information we may receive from other sources include: demographic information, device information (such as IP addresses), location, and online behavioral data (such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links). We use this information, alone or in combination with other information (including Personal Information) we collect, to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing and content to you and to develop and provide you with more relevant products features, and services.\n\n\n\n(h) Information from the use of our Mobile Apps: When you use our mobile apps, we may collect certain information in addition to information described elsewhere in this Policy. For example, we may collect information about the type of device and operating system you use. We may ask you if you want to receive push notifications about activity in your account. If you have opted in to these notifications and no longer want to receive them, you may turn them off through your operating system or through the in-app settings. We may use mobile analytics software to better understand how people use our application. We may collect information about how often you use the application and other performance data.\n\n\n\n\nUse and Disclosure of Personal Information\n\n\n\n\nWe may use and disclose Personal Information only for the following purposes:\n\n\n\n(a) To promote use of our services to you and others.\u00a0For example, if we collect your Personal Information when you visit our Website and do not sign up for any of the Services, we may send you an email inviting you to sign up. If you use any of our Services and we think you might benefit from using another Service we offer, we may send you an email about that. You can stop receiving our promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in every email we send. In addition, we may use information we collect in order to advertise our Services to you or suggest additional features of our Services that you might consider using. In addition, we may use your Personal Information to advertise our Services to potential or other users like you. For more information on how we use cookies or other tracking technologies for these purposes, as well as how to opt out of the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Statement here.\n\n\n\n(b) To send you informational and promotional content in accordance with your marketing preferences.\u00a0You can stop receiving our promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in every email.\n\n\n\n(c) To bill and collect money owed to us by our Users.\u00a0This includes sending you emails, invoices, receipts, notices of delinquency, and alerting you if we need a different credit card number. We use third parties for secure credit card transaction processing, and we send billing information to those third parties to process your orders and credit card payments. To learn more about the steps we take to safeguard that data, see Section 14 below.\n\n\n\n(d) To send you System Alert messages.\u00a0For example, we may inform you of temporary or permanent changes to our Services, such as planned outages, new features, version updates, releases, abuse warnings, and changes to our Privacy Policy.\n\n\n\n(e) To communicate with our Users about their account and provide customer support.\n\n\n\n(f) To enforce compliance with our Terms of Use and applicable law.\u00a0This may include developing tools and algorithms that help us prevent violations.\n\n\n\n(g) To protect the rights and safety of our Users and third parties, as well as our own.\n\n\n\n(h) To meet legal requirements,\u00a0including complying with court orders, valid discovery requests, valid subpoenas, and other appropriate legal mechanisms.\n\n\n\n(i) To provide information to representatives and advisors, including attorneys and accountants, to help us comply with legal, accounting, or security requirements.\n\n\n\n(j) To prosecute and defend a court, arbitration, or similar legal proceeding.\n\n\n\n(k) To respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n\n\n\n(l) To provide, support, and improve the Services we offer.\u00a0This includes our use of the data that our Users provide us in order to enable our Users to use the Services to communicate with their Contacts. This also includes, for example, aggregating information from your use of the Services or visit to our Websites and sharing this information with third parties to improve our Services. This might also include sharing your information or the information you provide us about your Contacts with third parties in order to provide and support our Services or to make certain features of the Services available to you. Specifically, we may share the Contact information with the company our Users work with or for in order to improve the services we offer. When we do have to share Personal Information with third parties, we take steps to protect your information by requiring these third parties to enter into a contract with us that requires them to use the Personal Information we transfer to them in a manner that is consistent with this policy.\n\n\n\n(m) To provide suggestions to you.\u00a0This includes adding features that compare Users\u2019 email campaigns, using data to suggest other publishers your Contacts may be interested in, or using data to suggest products or services that you may be interested in or that may be relevant to you or your Contacts. Some of these suggestions are generated by use of our Data Science Projects. For more information about our use of cookies and other tracking technologies for this purpose, and instructions about how to opt out of having data collected through the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Statement here.\n\n\n\n(n) To transfer your information\u00a0in the case of a sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganization, or acquisition. In that event, any acquirer will be subject to our obligations under this Privacy Policy, including your rights to access and choice. We will notify you of the change either by sending you an email or posting a notice on our Website.\n\n\n\nCombined Information: We may combine Personal Information with other information we collect or obtain about you (such as information we source from our third party partners), to serve you specifically, such as to deliver a product or service according to your preferences or restrictions, or for advertising or targeting purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy. When we combine Personal Information with other information in this way, we treat it as, and apply all of the safeguards in this Privacy Policy applicable to, Personal Information.\n\n\n\n\nData Collected for and by our Users\n\n\n\n\nAs you use our Services, you may import into our system Personal Information you have collected from your Contacts or other individuals. We have no direct relationship with your Contacts or any person other than you, and for that reason, you are responsible for making sure you have the appropriate permission for us to collect and process information about those individuals. Your contact list and all of your contact data will be stored on our servers in order to provide cross platform accessibility.\n\n\n\nConsistent with the uses of Personal Information covered in Section 6, we may transfer Personal Information of you or your Contacts to companies that help us promote, provide, or support our Services or the services of our Users (\u201cService Providers\u201d). All Service Providers enter into a contract with us that protects Personal Information and restricts their use of any Personal Information consistent with this policy. As part of our Services, we may use and incorporate into features information you have provided, we have collected from you, or we have collected about Contacts. We may share this information, including Contact email addresses, with third parties in line with the approved uses in Section 6.\n\n\n\nIf you are a Contact and no longer want to be contacted by one of our Users, please unsubscribe directly from that User\u2019s newsletter or contact the User directly to update or delete your data. If you contact us, we may remove or update your information within a reasonable time and after providing notice to the User of your request.\n\n\n\nWe will retain Personal Information we process on behalf of our Users for as long as needed to provide our Services or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our agreements.\n\n\n\n\nPublic Information and Third Party Websites\n\n\n\n\n(a) Blog. We have public blogs on our Websites. Any information you include in a comment on our blog may be read, collected, and used by anyone. If your Personal Information appears on our blogs and you want it removed, contact us\u00a0here. If we are unable to remove your information, we will tell you why.\n\n\n\n(b) Social media platforms and widgets. Our Websites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Website, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. We also maintain presences on social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Any information, communications, or materials you submit to us via a social media platform is done at your own risk without any expectation of privacy. We cannot control the actions of other users of these platforms or the actions of the platforms themselves. Your interactions with those features and platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.\n\n\n\n(c) Links to third-party websites. Our Websites include links to other websites, whose privacy practices may be different from ours. If you submit Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Website you visit.\n\n\n\n\nThird Parties\n\n\n\n\nWe may disclose Personal Information to the following types of third parties for the purposes described in this policy:\n\n\n\n(a) Service Providers. Sometimes, we share your information with our third party Service Providers, who help us provide and support our Services. For example, if it is necessary to provide you something you have requested (like enable a feature such as Social Profiles), then we may share your and/or your Contacts\u2019 Personal Information with a Service Provider for that purpose. Just like with the other third parties we work with, these third party Service Providers enter into a contract that requires them to use your Personal Information only for the provision of services to us and in a manner that is consistent with this policy. Examples of Service Providers include payment processors, hosting services and content delivery services.\n\n\n\n(b) Advertising partners. We may partner with third party advertising networks and exchanges to display advertising on our Websites or to manage and serve our advertising on other sites and may share Personal Information with them for this purpose. All third parties with which we share this information are required to use your Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. We and our third party partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as pixels and web beacons, to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to provide you with targeted advertising based on your browsing activities and interests.\n\n\n\n(c) Parent companies.\u00a0 Our Users typically are part of a \u201cParent Company\u201d, which is a company that they work with or for.\u00a0 We share information about these User\u2019s contacts with their respective Parent Companies in order to improve our services and provide them with data to improve the content they provide to their Users.\n\n\n\n\nContest and Sweepstakes\n\n\n\n\nWe may, from time to time, offer surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions on our Websites or through social media (collectively \u201cOur Promotions\u201d). Participation in our Promotions is completely voluntary. Information requested for entry may include personal contact information such as your name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address, username, and similar details. We use the information you provide to administer Our Promotions. We may also, unless prohibited by the Promotion\u2019s rules or law, use the information provided to communicate with you, or other people you select, about our Services. We may share this information with our affiliates and other organizations or Service Providers in line with this policy and the rules posted for the Promotion.\n\n\n\n\nContent of Email & Campaigns\n\n\n\n\nWhen you send content via email, it bounces from server to server as it crosses the Internet. Along the way, server administrators can read what you send. Email was not built for confidential information. Please do not use RapidFunnel to send confidential information.\n\n\n\nSometimes we review the content of our Users\u2019 email campaigns to make sure they comply with our Terms of Use. To improve that process, we have software that helps us find email campaigns that may violate our Terms. Our employees or independent contractors may review those particular email campaigns. This benefits all Users who comply with our Terms of Use because it reduces the amount of spam being sent through our servers and helps us maintain high deliverability.\n\n\n\n\nYour Information and Contacts\n\n\n\n\nWe acknowledge your ownership rights to all your contacts and information. We will never, under any circumstances, sell or rent your contact lists to anyone without your permission. Your Contact Lists are stored on a secure RapidFunnel server. If someone on your Contact List complains or contacts us, we might then contact that person/Contact. Only authorized employees have access to view Contact Lists. You may export (download) your Contact Lists from RapidFunnel at any time.\n\n\n\nWe will use and disclose the information in your Contact Lists only for the reasons discussed in Sections 6-9. We will not use and disclose the information in your Contact Lists to:\n\n\n\n\nbill or collect money owed to us;\n\n\n\nsend you system alert messages;\n\n\n\ncommunicate with you about your account; or\n\n\n\nsend you informational and promotional content.\n\n\n\n\nSECURITY\n\n\n\n\nNotice of Breach of Security\n\n\n\n\nIf a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that materially affects you or people on your Distribution Lists, then RapidFunnel will notify you as soon as possible and later report the action we took in response.\n\n\n\n\nSafeguarding Your Information\n\n\n\n\nWe take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.\n\n\n\nOur credit card processing vendor uses security measures to protect your information both during the transaction and after it is complete. Our vendor is certified as compliant with card association security initiatives, including the Visa Cardholder Information Security and Compliance (CISP), MasterCard\u00ae (SDP), and Discovery Information Security and Compliance (DISC). If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us at\u00a0here.\n\n\n\nRapidFunnel accounts require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Because the information in your Contact Lists are so sensitive, account passwords are encrypted, which means we cannot see your passwords. We cannot resend forgotten passwords either. We will only reset them.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\n\n\n\nWe Operate in the United States\n\n\n\n\nOur servers and offices are located in the United States, so your information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States. While the data protection, privacy, and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take many steps to protect your privacy, including offering a data processing addendum. By using our Websites, you understand and consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information to our facilities in the United States and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this policy.\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy and Retention of Data\n\n\n\n\nWe do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do so. If your data changes (for example, if you have a new email address), then you are responsible for notifying us of those changes. Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you with our Services. We may also retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our Agreements.\n\n\n\n\nAccess\n\n\n\n\nWe will give an individual, either a User or a Contact, access to any Personal Information we hold about them within 30 days of any request for that information. Individuals may request to access, correct, amend or delete information we hold about them by\u00a0contacting us here. Unless it is prohibited by law, we will remove any Personal Information about an individual, either you or a Contact, from our servers at your or their request. There is no charge for an individual to access or update their Personal Information.\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Privacy\n\n\n\n\nUnder California Law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship, (a) a list of the categories of Personal Information, such as name, email and mailing address and the type of services provided to the customer, that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please contact us through our contact form or email at privacy@RapidFunnel.com.\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Notice for Individuals located in the European Union\n\n\n\n\nYour personal data will be used and processed by RapidFunnel exclusively for the correct and complete fulfillment of our work to operate and support our authentic data sharing platform.\n\n\n\nRapidFunnel employees, business partners, and platform users may receive your personal data.\n\n\n\nRapidFunnel is based in the United States and may transfer and allow access to your personal data in additional countries outside of the European Union, with appropriate and suitable safeguards to protect your personal data.\n\n\n\nYour personal data will be stored until our customers delete it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nYou have the right to:\n\n\n\n\nRequest access to, correction, or erasure of your personal data\n\n\n\nRequest restriction of the processing of your personal data\u00a0\n\n\n\nObject to processing of your personal data\u00a0\n\n\n\nWithdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.\n\n\n\nTo lodge a complaint related to the use of your personal data with a European Union supervisory authority.\n\n\n\n\nProviding your personal data is necessary if you want to interact with RapidFunnel content and events.\n\n\n\nIf you wish to contact RapidFunnel\u2019s Data Protection Officer or European Representative regarding the use of your personal data or your rights related to the processing of your personal data, please contact us at contact form or email at privacy@rapidfunnel.com.\n\n\n\nUpdated February 24, 2020\n\t\t\t\t", "length": 28772, "excerpt": "Thanks for using RapidFunnel or visiting one of our websites and/or using our apps.
