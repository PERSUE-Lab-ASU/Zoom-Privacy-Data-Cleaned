This section provides required and courtesy disclosures and notices related to the General Data Protection Regulation and its counterpart regulation applicable to residents of the United Kingdom, U.S. state consumer privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and informational notices to residents of Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, and other U.S. states with laws providing similar protections, and Canada\u2019s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. This section is offered as a courtesy to describe the rights afforded to residents of jurisdictions offering certain privacy protections (each a \u201cConsumer\u201d). Please note that certain privacy laws may not apply to Steady. Depending on where you live, your rights over your Personal Information may include some or all of the rights listed below. Please note that privacy rights must be exercised via the Customer through which you access our Services. 1. Right to know how we collect and process your Personal Information. We have set the required notices in this Privacy Policy. We may provide you with additional notices about other ways we process your Personal Information, such as sending you a notice via email or by other means of communication. 2. Right to expect us to collect, use or disclose Personal Information responsibly and not for any other purpose other than which you consented. We set your expectations in this Privacy Policy, and we collect legally required consent at various stages of our interactions with you. If we collect or use your Personal Information based on your consent, we will also notify you of any changes and will request your further consent as required by law. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting privacy@steady.space. 3. Right to access your Personal Information. You can request to access your Personal Information. Upon request, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Information, along with details about the types of Personal Information we process, why we process it, and any third parties we work with to collect Personal Information on our behalf. We may have one or more legally valid reasons to refuse your request in whole or in part, for example to protect the rights of other individuals. If you are a California consumer, your request is limited to specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you over the past 12 months, and we only have to respond to two such requests within a 12-month period. 4. Right to accuracy, and the right to correct your Personal Information. If you become aware that the Personal Information that we hold about you is incorrect, or if your situation changes (e.g., change of address), please inform us and we will update our records. 5. No Sale of Personal Information. Steady does not sell your Personal Information to third parties. If this ever changes in the future, we will update this posting and provide you with methods to opt-out of such sale and sharing. 6. Do Not Share My Personal Information. Steady may share your Personal Information with third parties for cross-contextual advertising purposes, such as delivering ads to you on Facebook or Google. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, events, and other information we think may be of interest to you. Depending on where you reside, you may have the right to opt-out. Please contact us via our online form or email privacy@steady.space to inquire about opting out. 7. Limited Sensitive Personal Information. You do not need to submit any Sensitive Personal Information to use the Services. If you choose to include Sensitive Personal Information in your account profile, content or by other means, we will only use this information to facilitate your use of the Services or for our internal business purposes. Steady does not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you. If this ever changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and provide you with methods to limit use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. 8. Right to data portability. In some cases, we are required to provide your Personal Information to another organization at your request and in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format, so that the other organization can read and use it. 9. Right to deletion or erasure (a.k.a. the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d).* Upon your request, and in certain circumstances and where we are required to do so by law, we are required to delete your Personal Information. This right is not absolute, and we may be entitled to retain and process your Personal Information despite your request. If you make this request, we balance certain legal, contractual, and business interests against your right to request the deletion of your Personal Information. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations. 10. Right to restrict processing of your Personal Information. You may have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Information if (i) the data is inaccurate, (ii) the processing is unlawful, (iii) we no longer need the Personal Information, or (iv) you exercise your right to object. Your right to restrict may be limited to Personal Information that is sensitive in nature, or that is sold or shared for certain purposes. 11. Right to object to certain processing of your Personal Information. You may have the right to request, under certain circumstances and where we are required to do so by law, that we will limit our processing of your Personal Information as you request. 12. No \u201cProfiling\u201d or Automated Decision-Making. Steady does engage in activities that process your Personal Information by automated means (\u201cprofiling\u201d) or use automated decision-making (\u201cADM\u201d) to provide the Services. If this changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and provide you with an option to exercise your privacy rights related to such processing. 13. Right to disclosure of certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. If you are a resident of the State of California, you may request that we disclose (i) the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources for the Personal Information we have collected about you; (iii) our business purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information; and (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we disclose that Personal Information. Additionally, if a business sells or shares Personal Information, the consumer may request two separate lists stating (a) sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and (b) disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained. Steady is only required to respond to two disclosure requests within a 12-month period. 14. Right to nondiscrimination. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. If you are a resident of the State of California, we will not (i) deny you goods or services, (ii) charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, (iii) provide you a different level or quality of goods or services, (iv) retaliate against you as an employee, applicant for employment, or independent contractor for exercising your privacy rights; or (v) suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services, because you exercised a right under the CCPA. 15. Right to disclosure of marketing information. If you are a resident of the State of California, note that California\u2019s Shine the Light Act (Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84) entitles California consumers to request certain disclosures regarding Personal Information sharing with affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes.", "level": 1, "children": [{"role": "list item marker", "name": "3.
