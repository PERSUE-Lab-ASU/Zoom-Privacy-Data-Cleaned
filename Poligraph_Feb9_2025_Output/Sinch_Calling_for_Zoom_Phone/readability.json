Please note that it\u2019s not likely your data has been shared with all the listed categories of recipients. The sharing of your personal data depends on context: such as the specific Sinch service and where you live.\n\n\n\nType of recipientWhy is data shared? (Purpose)Sinch Group entitiesYour personal data will be shared within the Sinch Group, including for business continuity and information security and support purposes, as well as for legally mandated reporting, bookkeeping, billing, and similarly important activities.Telecommunications operatorsFor various Sinch services, communications are sent over telephone networks, in which case the message transmitted, and metadata, is shared with those network operators as the communication is sent as a part of ensuring it arrives at the correct destination and can be billed properly.Other providers of electronic communications servicesFor various Sinch services and products, communications are sent over channels provided or owned by other communications companies such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. If your personal data is involved in these services (by receiving or sending messages using Sinch services integrating such channels), that personal data for each message will be shared by the associated platform.Service providers or consultantsSinch will engage third party vendors and suppliers to process personal data on our behalf to be able to provide our services.

Upon that request, Sinch will provide a copy of the data and information about the processing, to an extent that does not infringe upon the rights of other data subjects or reveal confidential or proprietary information.\n\n\n\nb. Right to Data Portability:\u00a0If you request access to personal data about you that you yourself have provided, you can request that the data is provided in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and you can also request that the personal data is transmitted to another controller, if this is technically feasible.\n\n\n\nc.

Right to Withdraw Consent: If processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on that consent before you withdrew it.\n\n\n\nYou have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe your data rights have been violated. The responsible data protection supervisory authority for Sinch in the EU/EEA is Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten (\u201dIMY\u201d) in Sweden.\n\n\n\nThe service Sinch Email has also committed to cooperate and comply, in compliance with the EU-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPA) and the UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning personal data received in reliance on the EU-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF.\n\n\n\nIf you live outside the EU/EEA, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority or other government body in your country, state or region, but such government bodies are not available everywhere in the world. Regardless of where you live and work, you can always reach out to the Sinch Group Data Protection Officer at\u00a0dpo@sinch.com\u00a0if you have questions or to direct your concerns.\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\n\n\nLast Updated: 01 August 2024\n\n\n\nThis addendum (\u2018Addendum\u2019) to our group\u2019s global privacy policy available upon request (\u2018Group Privacy Policy\u2019), read with: (a) in the case of employees, the privacy notice shared with you via email or otherwise; or (ii) in the case of external parties, the privacy notice available at https://sinch.com/en-in/privacy-policy/; as the case may be; (\u2018Privacy Notice\u2019,\u00a0together with the Group Privacy Policy,\u00a0\u2018Global Data Privacy Policies\u2019), is intended to inform individuals (including but not limited to\u00a0 employees, customers, service providers, partners and their employees), about the manner in which Sinch Cloud Communications Services India Private Limited (\u2018Sinch\u2019, \u2018we\u2019 or \u2018us\u2019) collects information from you, processes your information, uses such information and discloses/ transfers such information, and the steps taken to protect such information.\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION\n\n\n\n\nDefinitionDescription\u2018Privacy Rules\u2019Shall mean the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011.\u2018Personal Data\u2019Shall mean any information that relates to a natural person, which, either directly or indirectly, in combination with other information available or likely to be available with a body corporate, is capable of identifying such person.\u2018Sensitive Personal Data\u2019Shall mean such Personal Data which consists of information relating to:1. password;2. financial information such as Bank account or credit card or debit card or other payment instrument details;3. physical, physiological and mental health condition;4. sexual orientation;5. medical records and history;6.
