Introduction</strong></p><p>Thank you for choosing IdealTraits Inc.’s (“IdealTraits”) products and services to help with your organization’s staffing needs.&nbsp; These Terms of Use (“Terms”) contain the terms under which IdealTraits provides its Services to you and describe how the Services may be accessed and used.&nbsp; IdealTraits may change the Terms from time to time, at IdealTraits’s sole discretion and without prior notice. Your use of this platform will constitute your assent to all such changes. Please periodically visit the TOU to review the current version of the Terms.

Overview of IdealTraits</strong></p><p>IdealTraits provides a platform that may function as an all around recruiting tool, allowing users to post jobs, assess candidate personalities, send offer letters, and more.&nbsp; Though the platform has the ability to do much more than assess personalities, the foundation of IdealTraits is the university backed Personality Assessment which is the best tool to use in identifying the right candidate for the right role within a business. The platform makes it easy for you to analyze data from individual assessments so that you can ensure proper placement of that candidate into your organization. In addition, the Personality Assessment can be used to help retain current employees, saving you valuable time and money associated with recruiting and hiring costs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3.

Third Party Information</strong></p><p>As a result of the nature of the Services provided through IdealTraits, you will have access to information (“Third Party Information”) from various sources including our suppliers, employers, and advertisers through the Platform. The Third Party Information contained on this Platform is provided for informational purposes only and should not be considered as professional advice. IdealTraits makes no representation, either express or implied, as to the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of any Third Party Information, nor does IdealTraits undertake to update or correct such Third Party Information. IdealTraits strongly recommends that you independently confirm all Third Party Information you obtain from the Services.</p><p><strong>10. Liability and Disclaimers</strong></p><p>With hiring becoming a more precision-oriented field, many Human Resource Departments in all sizes of businesses are looking for an advanced set of tools outlining the predictions on the potential of new hire candidates. The main aim is to find the right person for the job easier and far less expensive than traditional selection methods. IdealTraits provides a tool, through its Platform, for employee personality testing that employers can use as data on the individual to find out where he or she would fit into a company.</p><p>IdealTraits is not involved in the actual negotiation or the consummation of the transaction, which may result in a job placement between an employer and a candidate. As a result, IdealTraits has no control over the quality, safety, or legality of the candidate or their Personally Identifiable Information posted or transmitted, the truth or accuracy of the candidate’s resume, or the ability of candidates to fill the job openings for which they may be hired.</p><p>In addition, please be aware that there are risks including, but not limited to, the risk of physical harm, the risk associated with dealing with strangers, foreign nationals and underage persons or the risk of people acting under false pretenses. By using the Platform, you agree to assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom you come in contact through the Platform.</p><p>Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, IdealTraits cannot and does not confirm that each candidate is who they claim to be. IdealTraits does not and cannot be involved in employer to candidate dealings or control the behavior of candidates who apply to a job posting through IdealTraits. By your use of the Platform, you agree to release IdealTraits (and its agents, officers, shareholders, directors, and employees) from any claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential, direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with any disputes, which you may have with one or more users.</p><p>IdealTraits is under no legal obligation to, and generally does not, control the information provided by candidates which is made available through the Platform. Candidate’s information may, in some cases, be mislabeled or deceptively labeled. IdealTraits expect that you will use caution and common sense when using the Platform.</p><p>IdealTraits is not, and shall not be considered to be an employer in connection with your use of the Platform and IdealTraits shall not be responsible for any employment decisions, for whatever reason, made by any employer posting job opportunities on the Platform.</p><p><strong>11. Limitation of Liability and Indemnity</strong></p><p>To the fullest extent allowed by law, IdealTraits (and its agents, officers, shareholders, directors, and employees) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary and punitive damages arising out of the following:</p><ol><li>The use of or inability to use the Platform or Services</li><li>Any transaction conducted through or facilitated by the Platform</li><li>Any claim attributable to errors, omissions, or other inaccuracies in the Platform or Services</li><li>Unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data</li><li>Any other matter relating to the Platform or the services offered on the site, even if IdealTraits has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</li></ol><p>The Platform and the Content are provided on an “as is” basis without any warranties of any kind.
