They hold a small amount of data specific to that web site, which can later be used to help remember information you enter into the site (like your email or other contact info), preferences selected, and movement within the site. If you return to the previously visited web site (and your browser has cookies enabled), the web browser sends the small file to the web server, which tells it what activity you engaged in the last time you used the site, and the server can use the cookie to do things like expedite logging in and retrieving user data and keeping your browser session secure.</p><p>We use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information, and to facilitate eﬃcient and secure access to the Applications. We use two types of cookies: essential and non-essential cookies. Essential cookies are those necessary for use to provide services to you. All other cookies are non-essential.

We have provided, below, a full list of our cookies, categorized as described above. We have described the purpose of each, whether they are Videra or Third Party cookies, and how to withdraw consent to their use.
