      3. How We Share Your Personal Data
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We may share your Personal Data with third parties in the following
      circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc mb-4 ml-4">
      <li>
        <b>Service providers, vendors and analytics partners.</b> We work with
        third party service providers to operate our Platform, including for
        IT-hosting and maintenance, data processing and caching, AI-related
        processing, payment processing, and other services. These third parties
        may have access to or process your Personal Data as part of providing
        those services to us. In addition, we use analytics service providers
        such as Posthog and June.so to collect and process certain analytics
        data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Legal.</b> We may disclose your Personal Data to third parties if
        required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is
        necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response to a court order,
        judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise
        cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies. We also
        reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data that we believe, in
        good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against
        liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or
        unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves
        against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security
        or integrity of our Platform and any facilities or equipment used to
        make our Platform available, or (v) protect our property or other legal
        rights, including to enforce our agreements, or the rights, property, or
        safety of others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Merger.</b> We may disclose or otherwise transfer Personal Data to an
        acquirer, investor, successor or assignee as part of any merger,
        acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, financing or similar
        transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or
        receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third
        parties as one of our business assets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Consent.</b> We may also disclose your Personal Data with your
        permission.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We take measures to delete your Personal Data or keep it in a form that
      does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer
      necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we need to
      retain certain information as required by law, including to comply with
      tax requirements, or for as long as is reasonably necessary to meet
      regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse or
      enforce our terms and conditions. When determining the specific retention
      period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of service
      provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, and
      mandatory retention periods provided by law and the relevant statute of
      limitations. For instance, if a user terminates their account we will
      retain the data on their account for 90 days.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
      5. Your Rights in Relation to Your Personal Data
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Depending on where you reside, you may also have the following legal
      rights:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
      <li>
        <b>Access and Portability.</b> You may ask us to provide you with a copy
        of the Personal Data we maintain about you, including a machine-readable
        copy of the Personal Data that you have provided to us, and request
        information about its processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rectification and Deletion.</b> You may ask us to update and correct
        inaccuracies in your Personal Data, or to have the information
        anonymised or deleted, as appropriate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Restriction and Objection.</b> You may ask us to restrict the
        processing of your Personal Data, or object to such processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Consent Withdrawal.</b> You may withdraw any consent you previously
        provided to us regarding the processing of your Personal Data, at any
        time and free of charge. We will apply your preferences going forward
        and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you
        withdrew your consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Complaint.</b> You may lodge a complaint with the UK Information
        Commissioner's Office, who you can contact using the details found at
        www.ico.org.uk. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with
        your concerns before you approach the Information Commissioner's Office,
        so please contact us in the first instance.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details
      at the end of this Policy. Please note that there are exceptions and
      limitations to each of these rights.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">6. Third Parties</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Our Platform may contain links to other websites, products, or services
      that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy
      practices of these third parties. Please be aware that this Policy does
      not apply to your activities on these third-party services or any
      information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read
      their privacy policies before providing any information to them.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">7. Security</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We make reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data by using physical
      and electronic safeguards designed to improve the security of the
      information we maintain. However, because no electronic transmission or
      storage of information can be entirely secure, we can make no guarantees
      as to the security or privacy of your information, to the extent permitted
      by applicable law.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use Personal Data from children
      under 18 years of age, and no part of our Platform is directed to
      children. If you learn that a child has provided us with Personal Data in
      violation of this Policy, then you may alert us by contacting us using the
      contact details at the end of this Policy.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">9. Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We use outsourced services in the United States ("<b>U.S.</b>") in order
      to support our business. If you choose to use our Platform from regions of
      the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from
      U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your Personal Data
      outside of those regions to the U.S. for storage and processing.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We will comply with applicable data protection laws when transferring your
      Personal Data outside of the UK. In particular we will rely on (i) UK
      adequacy regulations, (ii) contractual protections for the transfer of
      your Personal Data, or (iii) another valid data transfer mechanism. You
      may contact us as specified below for more information about the
      safeguards we use to transfer Personal Data outside the UK.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">10. Changes to this Policy</h2>
