Our customers trust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We collect and use personal information only to allow us to provide our products and services to our customers and end users and we do so at the direction of our customers. We do not and will not sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is required in the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger or acquisition.</p><h2>2.
