							<h2>1. Introduction</h2><p><strong>We care about your privacy.</strong> We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals. Our customers trust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We collect and use personal information only to allow us to provide our products and services to our customers and end users and we do so at the direction of our customers. We do not and will not sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is required in the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger or acquisition.</p><h2>2. Data Privacy Framework</h2><p>Class adheres to the principles of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Class relies on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as a legal basis for the transfers of personal information. To learn more, visit our <a href="https://assets.class.com/m/7c137f05bd047f7f/original/Class-Technologies-Inc-DPF-Privacy-Supplement.pdf." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Data Privacy Framework Notice here</a>.</p><p>In the United States, we comply with applicable state laws, regulations, and other legal binding requirements relating to privacy, data protection, data security, and the processing of Personal Data, including but not limited to and to the extent applicable, the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Ci. Code. § 1798.100 et seq. and associated regulations and amendments, (“CCPA”).</p><p>We take appropriate safeguards to protect your privacy, your fundamental rights and freedoms, and the ability to exercise your rights. For example, if we transfer personal information from the <strong>EEA, the UK, or Switzerland</strong> to another country such as the United States, we will implement an appropriate data transfer solution such as entering into “standard contractual clauses” approved by the European Commission or competent governmental authority (as applicable) with you, the data exporter. If your use of Class products or services requires us to process any personally identifiable information (PII” or “Personal Data”), we shall do so at all times in compliance with the Class Technologies, Inc. <a href="https://assets.class.com/m/4880dc0f79b8a0c2/original/Class-Technologies-Inc-Data-Protection-Addendum.pdf." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Data Processing Addendum</a>.</p><h2>3.

Children’s Privacy – Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h2><p>We support the guidelines and regulatory requirements provided in COPPA. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 unless and until the relevant institution has provided consent and authorization for a student under 13 to use the products and services and for us to collect information from such student. Where a customer institution instructs us to collect personal information from children under the age of 13, we collect, use, process and retain such information solely to provide the services on behalf of the customer and for the purposes set forth in our agreement with the customer. We collect only as much information as is necessary to provide the service and the customer may access, delete or withdraw consent for continued processing of the child’s information at any time. If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting personal information of a child under the age of 13, please contact your educational institution directly.</p><h2>5. United States – FERPA and State Education Privacy Laws</h2><p>We provide products and services to schools and other educational institutions. Through the provision of these products and services, we may collect personally identifiable information from or about students (“Student Data”), which may include educational records governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). We consider such Student Data to be strictly confidential and in general do not use such data for any purpose other than improving and providing our products and services to the educational institution or on the educational institution’s behalf. Our collection, use, and sharing of Student Data is governed by our contracts with the educational institutions, the provisions of FERPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), and other applicable laws that relate to the collection and use of personal information of students, but not by the provisions contained in this Privacy Statement.

Class may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</h3><ul><li>Users (or their Parents/Guardians in the event Users are also Minors) have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li><li>provision of Data and processing of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li><li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Class is subject;</li><li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in Class;</li><li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Class or by an authorized third party;</li><li>to better understand how our services are used and improve the content and general administration of our services.</li></ul><p>In any case, Class will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p><h3>D. Place</h3><p>The Data is processed at Class operating facilities and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. Depending on the User’s location, data transfers may involve transferring the User’s Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data and the Class Trust Center.</p><p>If broader protection standards are applicable, Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or United Kingdom or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by Class to safeguard their Data. If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with Class using the information provided in the contact section.</p><h3>9. Retention Time</h3><p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose for which they have been collected.</p><p>Therefore:</p><ul><li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between Class and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li><li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of Class’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by Class within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting Class.</li></ul><p>Class may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, Class may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority. Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
