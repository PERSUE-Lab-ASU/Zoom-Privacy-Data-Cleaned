Introduction to the Privacy Policy and What It Covers</h2><p>Clari, Inc. ("Clari") knows that you care about how your corporate and personal information is used and shared—and we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") covers Clari's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and enterprise information ("Enterprise Information") such as CRM data, files, email/calendar information, and contacts that you submit, or Clari otherwise gathers, when you access or use the Service. Together, Personal Information and Enterprise Information will be referred to as "Information."</p><p>By using the www.clari.com website ("Site") or any of our Clari applications available via the application URL app.clari.com and the Clari mobile applications, Clari Mobile and Clari Connect (collectively, the "Service"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you consent that we will collect, use, and share your information as set forth below. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the sole purpose of providing the service for which your organization (Clari's "Client") has engaged Clari. Specific services offered are governed by the Clari Master Service Agreement and business terms for the items purchased by the Client per the Order Agreement.</p><p>Remember that your use of Clari's Services is at all times subject to our <a href="/msa/2023-09-19/">Master Subscription Agreement</a>, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.</p><p>This Privacy Policy covers how we treat Personal Data that we gather when you access or use our Services. "Personal Data" means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual and also includes information referred to as "personally identifiable information" or "personal information" under applicable data privacy laws, rules, or regulations. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies we don't own or control or people we don't manage.</p><p><a href="#contents">Back to Top</a></p><p style="margin: -14px;"><a id="sources" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -160px; visibility: hidden;"></a>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Sources of Personal Data</h2><p>We collect Personal Data about you from:</p><p>1. You:</p><ul><li>when you provide such information directly to us, and</li><li>when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Services.</li></ul><p>2. Our subsidiaries and affiliates (together, "Affiliates"), when they provide us with Personal Data about you.</p><p>3. Third parties, when they provide us with Personal Data about you ("Third Parties"). Third Parties that share your Personal Data with us include:</p><ul><li><strong>Service providers.</strong> For example, Clari links to other services, such as Gmail (as described in more detail in the section below titled "Google Services") and Salesforce. Clari does not access any information from these third-party services without your authorization, or by the authorization of your organization. You grant Clari this authorization when you connect these services to Clari, or when your organization's IT team authorizes these connections on your behalf.

You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on Clari's site to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third-party Social Media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on Clari's site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Advertising partners.</strong> We receive information about you from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements, or communications.</li></ul><h3>2.1 Google Services</h3><p>Certain features or functions of the Service may require Clari to access your Google Gmail for Business account and certain data in such account via Google's Gmail "Application Programming Interface" ("API"). We will only do this with your consent (for example, if you or the Gmail administrator in your organization authorizes Clari to connect to Gmail, you are granting such consent). Specific restrictions on our use of that data are set forth below. To the extent these terms differ or conflict with any other terms of this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy controls.</p><p>Generally, Clari requires read-only access to your Business Gmail account. Certain features of the Clari platform (such as Groove by Clari) also require compose/modify access to your Business Gmail account. By authorizing Clari to connect to your account, you are giving Clari access to all email content in your account as defined by Google's Gmail API.</p><p>Clari collects email and calendar metadata for the sole business-related use of the user and Clari's Client. The following data is stored:</p><ul><li>Gmail fields (Sender, Recipient, Date, Time, Subject, Attachment Name)</li><li>GCalendar fields (Meeting Organizer, Guests, Date, Time, Meeting Title, Attachment Name)</li></ul><p>The data collected is used by Clari to provide you and your business with visibility into sales opportunity activities.</p><p>We may also use the data (i) if we reasonably believe such use is required by any law, regulation, or government body or court, (ii) as necessary to help prevent a security threat to the Service, and (iii) to help internally improve the Service.</p><p>Clari will not sell your data or use it for serving advertisements.</p><p>The data obtained is subject to these additional restrictions:</p><ul><li>Clari will not transfer the data to others unless (i) doing so is necessary to comply with any law, regulation, or government body or court, or (ii) as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of Clari's assets.</li><li>Clari will not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements.</li><li>Clari will not sell your data.</li><li>The Service will not allow humans to read this data unless necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations and for occasional support purposes.</li><li>Clari's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Google API Services User Data Policy</u></a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</li></ul><p><a href="#contents">Back to Top</a></p><p style="margin: -14px;"><a id="categories" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -160px; visibility: hidden;"></a>&nbsp;</p><h2>3.

How We Use Your Personal Data</h2><p>We process Personal Data to operate, improve, understand, and personalize our Services. We use Personal Data for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>To operate and maintain the Service (such as for the purposes of fixing malfunctions, testing our security systems, etc.).</li><li>To enhance, improve and further develop the Service (such as creating new features or functions, refining the user experience, increasing Service technical performance, etc.).</li><li>We will use your contact information to provide you with notices related to your use of the Service.</li><li>We will use your contact information (such as your email address) to provide you with training and emails with relevant product information.
