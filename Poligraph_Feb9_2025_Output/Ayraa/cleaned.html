We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it in accordance with applicable laws, including through appropriate written data processing terms and/or data transfer agreements.</p><p> </p><p>If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and we process your personal information in a jurisdiction that the European Commission has deemed to not provide an adequate level of data protection (a “third country”), we rely upon legal measures to adequately protect your personal information, such as putting in place standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or another measure that has been approved by the EU Commission as adducing adequate safeguards for the protection of personal information when transferred to a third country. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal information is transferred outside of the EEA; you may request such details by contacting us as set forth in the “Contact us” section below.</p><p> </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Security of Your Personal Information</strong></p><p> </p><p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We have implemented a security program designed to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation, and destruction. However, no transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that our services will always be secure,.</p><p> </p><p>We encourage you to help protect the security of your personal information. For instance, never give out your personal credentials when you are using the Services, so that other people will not have access to your personal information. Furthermore, you are responsible for maintaining the security of any personal computing device on which you utilize the Services. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p><p> </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Your Choices</strong></p><p> </p><p>Correcting or Deleting Personal Information.

Please note that we may retain certain information about you as required by law or as permitted by law for legitimate business purposes (e.g., in accordance with our record retention policies or to enforce our Terms of Service).</p><p> </p><p>If you wish to make an access or correction request regarding your personal information, please contact the Privacy Director, as referenced below.</p><p> </p><p>Opting out of Email Communications. We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to company users. You may opt-out of such communications at all times by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you transactional e-mails, such as about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.</p><p> </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Additional Rights for EEA individuals</strong></p><p> </p><p>According to the GDPR, individuals in the EEA have the below rights with respect to their personal information. Please note that your ability to exercise certain rights (objection; portability) will depend on the basis on which your personal information is processed (see section ii), and the exercise of all rights may be subject to exemptions or restrictions under applicable law – we will advise you if we rely on these. We may also need to ask you to provide evidence of your identity before complying with a request.</p><p> </p><p>Right of access: You can ask us to: confirm whether we are processing your personal information; give you a copy of that information; provide you with other information about your personal information such as what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it abroad and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your information from and whether we have carried out any profiling, to the extent that such information has not already been provided to you in this Policy.</p><p> </p><p>Right to rectify and complete personal information: You can ask us to rectify inaccurate information. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.</p><p> </p><p>Right of erasure: You can ask us to erase your personal information, but only where: it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent); following a successful right to object (see ‘Objection’ below); it has been processed unlawfully; or to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject. We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary: for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. There are certain other circumstances in which we are not required to comply with your erasure request, although these two are the most likely circumstances in which we would deny that request.</p><p> </p><p>Right of restriction: You can ask us to restrict (i.e., keep but not use) your personal information, but only where: its accuracy is contested, to allow us to verify its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending. We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction, where: we have your consent; to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</p><p> </p><p>Right to object to our use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes: You can request that we change the manner in which we contact you for marketing purposes. You can request that we not transfer your personal information to unaffiliated third parties for the purposes of direct marketing or any other purposes.</p><p> </p><p>Right to object for other purposes: You have the right to object at any time to any processing of your personal information which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis. You may exercise this right without incurring any costs. If you raise an objection, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms. The right to object does not exist, in particular, if the processing of your personal information is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.</p><p> </p><p>Right to (data) portability: You can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it ‘ported’ directly to another Data Controller, but only where our processing is based on your consent and the processing is carried out by automated means.</p><p> </p><p>Right to withdraw consent: You can withdraw your consent in respect of any processing of personal information which is based upon a consent which you have previously provided.</p><p> </p><p>Right to obtain a copy of safeguards: you can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information is transferred outside the EU/EEA. We may redact data transfer agreements to protect commercial terms.</p><p> </p><p>Right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority: You have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority if you have concerns about how we are processing your personal information. We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issue with us first, although you have a right to contact your supervisory authority at any time.</p><p> </p><p>Submitting a GDPR Request: please contact us as set out in the “Contact Us” section below to exercise one of these rights. If we receive any requests from individuals related to the Platform Data, we will forward the request to the relevant clients.</p><p> </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Retention</strong></p><p> </p><p>We will generally keep personal information only for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purposes for which it was collected or as authorized or required by law.

All retained personal information will remain subject to the terms of this Policy.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Communication of Corrections or Erasures</strong></p><p>‍<br>We will communicate corrections or erasures of personal information to authorized users and relevant third parties to whom the personal information has been shared or transferred.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍<br><strong>Logging and Tracking Legal Disclosures</strong></p><p><strong>‍<br></strong>Personal information disclosed for legal purposes will be logged, tracked, and maintained in our designated tracking system for historical and audit purposes.</p><p>‍</p><p> </p><p><strong>Changes to this Policy</strong></p><p> </p><p>This Policy is current as of the date set forth above.
