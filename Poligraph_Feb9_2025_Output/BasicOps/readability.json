We do not sell, rent or lease customer lists or personal information to third parties. We may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or process payments. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to BasicOps, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. We may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within BasicOps, in order to determine what services are the most popular. This data is used to help monitor, improve, and deliver customized content and advertising within BasicOps to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

The data are used only to provide functionality for you and your team. BasicOps will not use such data to train generalized AI or ML models.</p><h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3><p>Information about your computer hardware and software and mobile hardware and software may be automatically collected when you use the Services. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for operation of our Services and to help monitor, improve, maintain, and provide general statistics regarding the use of our Services.</p><h3>Use of Cookies</h3><p>We may use \u201ccookies\u201d, or other technologies like pixels or web beacons, to help you personalize your online experience and help us monitor, analyze and improve the Services. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. We use both session-based and persistent cookies. Any time you register on a site, use a site, or identify yourself or the computer you are using through a site, you have given use permission to link personally identifiable information with cookies. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. For example, if you sign up for a BasicOps account, a cookie helps BasicOps to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information. When you return to the same BasicOps page, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our Services or websites you visit. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p><h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3><p>The security of your information is important to us. BasicOps secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) as part of our Services, we encrypt the transmission of that information using industry-standard encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. We take necessary steps to protect your information from misuse, loss, or unauthorized access or disclosure.</p><h3>Children Under Thirteen</h3><p>Our Services are not directed for persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at contact@basicops.com.</p><h3>Opt-Out &amp; Unsubscribe</h3><p>We respect your privacy and give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving announcements of certain information. Users may opt-out of receiving any or all communications from BasicOps by contacting us at contact@basicops.com.</p><h3>Changes to this Statement</h3><p>BasicOps will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback.
