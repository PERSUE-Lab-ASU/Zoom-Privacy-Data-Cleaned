These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities when using our online collaboration tools and platform (the “Services”) provided by BasicOps, Inc. (“BasicOps”, “we”, “us” or “our”). Our Privacy Policy also governs the Services and informs users of our data collection practices. By using the Services, you agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy. Please read these terms carefully, and keep a copy of them for your reference.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Electronic Communications</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Using the Services or sending emails to BasicOps constitutes electronic communications. You consent to receive electronic communications and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically, via email and through the Services, satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Account</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">BasicOps only offers company accounts on behalf of business entities and does not offer personal accounts on behalf of individuals. To use the Services, you’re agreeing that you have the authority to create a company account on behalf of the business entity, such as your employer. To create a company account, an individual (“User”), who represents the organization or business entity (the “Customer”) signs up on our website to initiate the first user account. The first user account, by default, is the “Administrator”. The first user account can then invite other individuals (“Users”), including external users, to create user accounts and begin using the Services. Administrators can also assign other Users to be designated Administrators. The terms “you” or “your”, as used herein, shall refer to Customer, Administrator and Users. The Services allow you to create projects and tasks and associated information, text, files, video, images, documents and other materials of any type that you upload, post, transmit, submit or otherwise make available to or through the Services (together the “Customer Data”) and to share that Customer Data with other Users. Users are responsible for all Customer Data that you upload, post, transmit, submit or otherwise make available via the Services. BasicOps does not control the Customer Data posted via the Services. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your account to any other person or entity.

  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last updated: June 17, 2024</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Protecting your private information is our priority. This Statement of Privacy applies to BasicOps, Inc.(together, “we”, “us”, ”our” or “BasicOps”), our online collaboration tools and platform (the “Services”), and governs data collection and usage. Our Services are currently available for use via a web browser on your desktop and mobile devices. By using BasicOps and the Services, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Collection and Use of your Information</h2><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Information you Provide</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">BasicOps only offers company accounts on behalf of business entities and does not offer personal accounts on behalf of individuals. To use the Services, you’re agreeing that you have the authority to create a company account on behalf of the business entity, such as your employer. To create a company account, an individual (“User”), who represents the organization or business entity (the “Customer”) signs up on our website to initiate the first user account. The first user account, by default, is the “Administrator”. The first user account can then invite other individuals (“Users”), including external users, to create user accounts and begin using the Services. Administrators can also assign other Users to be designated Administrators. The terms “you” or “your”, as used herein, shall refer to Customer, Administrator and Users. The Services allow you to create projects and tasks and associated information, text, files, video, images, documents and other materials of any type that you upload, post, transmit, submit or otherwise make available to or through the Services (together the “Customer Data”) and to share that Customer Data with other Users. Users are responsible for all Customer Data that you upload, post, transmit, submit or otherwise make available via the Services. BasicOps does not control the Customer Data posted via the Services. When you create an account and when you invite Users, we will collect personally identifiable information associated with the account, some of which may or may not be optional such as your:</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">– Name – Company – E-mail Address – Password – Photograph – Phone Number</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We will utilize a third party credit card payment processing company to collect payment information, including your credit card number, billing address and phone number. This information is used to complete the purchase transaction. We will share this payment information with the third party processing company. We do not store your payment information. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through BasicOps’ public message boards, blogs or online forums this information may be collected and used by others. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from BasicOps so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. We are not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on other websites when you leave BasicOps. Even if you are not a registered user of our Services, if you email us, we may retain a record of such email communication, including your email address, the content of your email, and our response.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Use of your Information</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">BasicOps collects and uses your information to deliver the services you have requested. You retain ownership of your Customer Data, but by uploading it onto the Services, you are granting us a license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, publish, transmit, host and display that Customer Data for the purpose of (i) providing you the Services and support; (ii) displaying the Customer Data to the Customer and Users; and (iii) analyzing and improving the operation of the Services. The Customer, whether that Customer is your employer or another organization, that Customer determines its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Customer Data which may apply to your use of the Services. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings it has in place. Administrators have complete access to all Customer Data submitted under that account by its users. As a user, by using the Services, you grant permission to the Administrator to access, use, download, export, disclose, share, restrict and/or remove Customer Data associated with the account. We may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from BasicOps and our affiliates. BasicOps may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered. We do not sell, rent or lease customer lists or personal information to third parties. We may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or process payments. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to BasicOps, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. We may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within BasicOps, in order to determine what services are the most popular. This data is used to help monitor, improve, and deliver customized content and advertising within BasicOps to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on BasicOps or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of BasicOps; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BasicOps, or the public.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Data from third-party services</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may connect your BasicOps account with third-party services, allowing BasicOps to retrieve data from these third-party services. The data are used only to provide functionality for you and your team. BasicOps will not use such data to train generalized AI or ML models.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Automatically Collected Information</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Information about your computer hardware and software and mobile hardware and software may be automatically collected when you use the Services. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for operation of our Services and to help monitor, improve, maintain, and provide general statistics regarding the use of our Services.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Use of Cookies</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may use “cookies”, or other technologies like pixels or web beacons, to help you personalize your online experience and help us monitor, analyze and improve the Services. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. We use both session-based and persistent cookies. Any time you register on a site, use a site, or identify yourself or the computer you are using through a site, you have given use permission to link personally identifiable information with cookies. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. For example, if you sign up for a BasicOps account, a cookie helps BasicOps to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information. When you return to the same BasicOps page, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our Services or websites you visit. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Security of your Personal Information</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The security of your information is important to us. BasicOps secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) as part of our Services, we encrypt the transmission of that information using industry-standard encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. We take necessary steps to protect your information from misuse, loss, or unauthorized access or disclosure.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Children Under Thirteen</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our Services are not directed for persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at contact@basicops.com.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Opt-Out &amp; Unsubscribe</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We respect your privacy and give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving announcements of certain information. Users may opt-out of receiving any or all communications from BasicOps by contacting us at contact@basicops.com.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Changes to this Statement</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">BasicOps will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. BasicOps encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how BasicOps is protecting your information.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Contact Information</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">BasicOps welcomes your questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy.
