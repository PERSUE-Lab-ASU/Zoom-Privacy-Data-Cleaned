<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also may automatically collect from your device: language settings, IP address, time zone, type and model of a device, device settings, operating system, other technical information. We need this data to provide our services (for example, to render a certain element of the product), analyze how our customers use the app (for example, to know whether our customers use the features we release), to serve ads.

<p><strong>2. Apple Health Kit (and Apple Motion &amp; Fitness API) or Google Fit (together the “Health App”)</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provided you give express permission on your device, we may receive (read) or/and write (share) data about your activity with/from Health App. In some of our Apps, you may decide to allow us to read (receive) the following information from the Health App: the number of steps, covered distance, weight, and dietary energy, and other data that you chose on the consent screen.

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Band fitness data. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We provide a holistic approach to wellness and fitness and allow our users to buy BetterMe Band, which is a fitness tracker device. When you connect the device to the BetterMe App, we may process the data collected by the devices (for example, steps count, heart rate measurements, sleep statistics). We will strive to ask you for your consent to process such data before collecting it (usually, on a pop-up screen that emerges when you connect the device to the App).</span></p>
<p><strong>2. Device and Geolocation data</strong><strong><br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect data from your mobile device. Examples of such data include: language settings, Internet Protocol address, time zone, type and model of a device, device settings, operating system, Internet service provider, mobile carrier, hardware ID, and Facebook ID. If you consent in certain of our products to share the geolocation data (for example, for you running routes), the app may receive this data as well.</span></p>
<p><strong>3. Advertising IDs</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect your Apple Identifier for Advertising (“IDFA”) or Google Advertising ID (“AAID”) (depending on the operating system of your device). You can typically reset these numbers through the settings of your device’s operating system (but we do not control this).</span></p>
<p><strong>4. Cookies and similar tracking technologies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our products employ technologies (cookies, SDKs, etc.) to process your data to enhance your user experience, optimize ads, and analyze traffic. These technologies are activated when you interact with our services, visit our website, use our apps, or enable certain features like chats. Disabling these technologies may affect the functionality of certain features, although our products will remain usable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, we and our partners utilize targeting technologies to tailor ads, potentially displaying them to you at relevant moments. When enabled, your interactions with our website or app could result in seeing our ads on social media platforms, assisting us in measuring ad campaign effectiveness. We respect your right to privacy and provide you with the option not to allow data processing that is not required for providing you the services you request. We use, in particular, the following categories of tracking technologies:</span></p>
<p><strong>Strictly necessary</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our products and their features require certain technologies to function properly. These technologies are typically activated when you request our service, for example, when you visit our website or open the app. By utilizing them, we can (i) remember your preferences as you navigate our products, (ii) ensure swift loading of the content you request, (iii) enhance the security of our products, and (iv) enable other functionalities of our products.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, some of these technologies are activated when you enable certain features like chats or request customer support.</span></p>
<p><strong>Functional</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use functional technologies to personalize and enhance your experience. By utilizing them, we can remember your choices (for example, custom design settings or storing your language preference for an extended period). Additionally, they provide you with a more consistent user experience by remembering your settings, keeping you logged in for extended periods, or saving your shopping cart selections.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you disable these technologies, some features may not function properly, although you will still be able to use our products.</span></p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use performance technologies to process information about how you and others interact with our products. This helps us understand user engagement with our products and features, and identify preferences or dislikes. Some examples include:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Counting visits and identifying traffic sources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Understanding which sections or features are most favored.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Analyzing user preferences to help us decide what new features to build.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you disable performance technologies, we will not receive certain information that we process for analytical purposes.</span></p>
<p><strong>Targeting</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, and our partners, use targeting technologies to tailor ads and possibly even display them to you at relevant times. For instance, if these technologies are enabled and you interact with our website or app, you might see ads for our products in your social media feeds. Additionally, they help us measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and make advertising more relevant to you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decline these targeting technologies, you may see less relevant ads and miss our timely offers. It would also be more challenging for us to measure ad effectiveness.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a id="purposes"></a>2. What are the purposes and legal bases for processing your personal data</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect and utilize your data primarily to provide our services, enhance the quality of our fitness and wellness services and to continuously improve them.

<h3><strong>A. General privacy rights&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be in control of your personal data, you have the following rights:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Accessing / reviewing / updating / correcting your personal data.&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to review, edit, or change the personal data that you had previously provided to us. If you would like to receive a copy of data we process, please send us a data access request or depending on the product you use, look for a data access privacy feature that is usually available in the profile section.</span></li>

When you request deletion of your personal data, we will use reasonable efforts to honor your request. In some cases we may be legally required to keep some of the data for a certain time (for example, information about your payments and your requests to us); in such event, we will fulfill your request in relation to portion of the data within the timeframes required for exercising data deletion requests and to another portion of the data after we have complied with our retention obligations (for example, after the end of data retention period obligation for payment data).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Getting to know the details of the processing</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You have the right to be informed about the collection and use of your personal data. This means that you have the right to understand what personal data is being processed, why it's being processed, who it's being shared with, how long it's being stored. We strive to follow the transparency requirements and provide most of the information in this </span><a href="../../../privacy-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, if you have any questions about our data processing practices or if you would like more details about how we use your personal data, please contact us.&nbsp;</span></li>
