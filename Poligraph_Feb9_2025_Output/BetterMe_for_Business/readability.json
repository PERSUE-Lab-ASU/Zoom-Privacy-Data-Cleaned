When enabled, your interactions with our website or app could result in seeing our ads on social media platforms, assisting us in measuring ad campaign effectiveness. We respect your right to privacy and provide you with the option not to allow data processing that is not required for providing you the services you request. We use, in particular, the following categories of tracking technologies:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Strictly necessary</strong><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Our products and their features require certain technologies to function properly. These technologies are typically activated when you request our service, for example, when you visit our website or open the app. By utilizing them, we can (i) remember your preferences as you navigate our products, (ii) ensure swift loading of the content you request, (iii) enhance the security of our products, and (iv) enable other functionalities of our products.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Moreover, some of these technologies are activated when you enable certain features like chats or request customer support.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Functional</strong><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>We use functional technologies to personalize and enhance your experience. By utilizing them, we can remember your choices (for example, custom design settings or storing your language preference for an extended period). Additionally, they provide you with a more consistent user experience by remembering your settings, keeping you logged in for extended periods, or saving your shopping cart selections.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>If you disable these technologies, some features may not function properly, although you will still be able to use our products.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>We use performance technologies to process information about how you and others interact with our products. This helps us understand user engagement with our products and features, and identify preferences or dislikes. Some examples include:</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>- Counting visits and identifying traffic sources.</span><span><br></span><span>- Understanding which sections or features are most favored.</span><span><br></span><span>- Analyzing user preferences to help us decide what new features to build.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>When you disable performance technologies, we will not receive certain information that we process for analytical purposes.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Targeting</strong><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>We, and our partners, use targeting technologies to tailor ads and possibly even display them to you at relevant times. For instance, if these technologies are enabled and you interact with our website or app, you might see ads for our products in your social media feeds. Additionally, they help us measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and make advertising more relevant to you.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>If you decline these targeting technologies, you may see less relevant ads and miss our timely offers. It would also be more challenging for us to measure ad effectiveness.</span></p>\n<h2><strong><a id=\"purposes\"></a>2.
