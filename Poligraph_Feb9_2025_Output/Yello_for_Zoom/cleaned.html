Examples include, but are not limited to, the following functionality:</p><ul><li><strong>Content Delivery: </strong>We partner with service providers to host our Site and deliver specific content in support of our Services. For example, we use Adobe Typekit to serve fonts on our Site, which is governed by <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policies/adobe-fonts.html">Adobe Typekit’s Privacy Policy</a>. We also partner with companies like YouTube to deliver specific content delivery like audio and video. For more information about how YouTube collects and uses your data, visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Customer Interaction: </strong>We enhance our customer interactions by offering features like Google Maps to locate our Service locations, payment processors to facilitate online payments. Each of these offerings are governed by the terms, conditions, and policies of the underlying service provider. For example, please see <a href="https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps/">Google Maps/Google Earth Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how that feature operates.</li></ul><h3>Website Analytics and Session Replay</h3><p>We use analytics and session replay services, that use cookies and other technologies that collect your Personal Information, to assist us with analyzing our Site traffic and site usage to optimize, maintain, and secure our Site and inform subsequent business decisions (including, e.g., advertising). These include, but are not limited to, the following third-party services:</p><ul><li><strong>Microsoft Clarity:</strong> We partner with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising to capture how you use and interact with our Site through behavioral metrics, heatmaps, and session replay to improve and market our products/services. Site usage data is captured using first and third-party cookies and other tracking technologies to determine the popularity of products/services and online activity.

To learn more about Google Analytics cookies, visit <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage">Google Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites</a>.</li></ul><h3>Interest-Based Advertising</h3><p>We may also allow or enable third parties to collect Personal Information to provide their interest-based advertising on behalf of our products and Services, or their own. Interest-based advertising occurs when advertisements are shown to you based on information collected from your online interactions over time and across multiple websites, devices, or online services that you visit or use. Some companies may engage in cross-context behavioral advertising to predict your preferences and show you advertisements that are most likely to be of interest or relevant to you. We do not control these third parties’ collection or use of your information for these purposes, or the opt-out options they may individually offer you via their terms, conditions, and privacy policies. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. Examples of the third-party service providers we engage to serve interest-based advertisements include Google Ads (including Google Dynamic Remarketing and DoubleClick), Meta Ads (including Meta Pixels and Facebook advertising services), TikTok (including the TikTok Pixel), LinkedIn marketing solutions (including LinkedIn Ads and Analytics), X Advertising, Microsoft advertising, and Adobe.</p><h3>Selling or Sharing Personal Information</h3><p>While we do not sell Personal Information in exchange for monetary consideration, we do share Personal Information for other benefits that could be deemed a “sale” or “sharing” under various data protection laws, because they are sometimes broadly defined to include activities such as the delivery of interest-based advertising on websites or allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies, IP address, and/or browsing behavior. We similarly engage in interest-based advertising when we use data about your activities on our Site to serve you ads on websites owned or controlled by third parties. It is in this context that we have provided advertising networks, data analytics providers, social networks, and video sharing platforms with Personal Information such as your IP address, device information, Internet and other electronic network activity information, and geolocation information in the last twelve months.</p><h3>Product-Based Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3><p>We may also deploy variations of the cookies and related tracking technologies discussed in this <em>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</em> section within our products and Services, including any mobile applications and widgets. For your convenience, a table of those product-based cookies is included below for reference.</p>								</div>

<h3>Links to Third-Party Websites</h3>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Site, including the information or content contained within them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing Personal Information to third parties, since any Personal Information disclosed will be handled in accordance with the applicable third party’s privacy policy.</p>

<h2>International Use and Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
<p>If you are visiting our Site from outside of the United States, please note that our Site is hosted in the United States. Where permitted by applicable law, we may transfer the personal data we collect about you to the United States and other jurisdictions that may not be deemed to provide the same level of data protection as your home country, as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy.</p>
<p><em>For individuals in the European Union, European Economic Area, Switzerland, and United Kingdom:</em> Yello will only transfer Personal Data to third parties located outside of this region when it has ensured appropriate safeguards for such Personal Information through use of the standard contractual clauses or other lawful and approved methods.

<h2>How We Protect Personal Information</h2>
<p>We have implemented commercially reasonable measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. despite these efforts to store Personal Information in a secure environment, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information during its transmission or its storage on our systems. For example, Customers and Candidates are solely responsible for the security of their account credentials (e.g., passwords) and exercising caution when posting or sharing information in public areas of the Site or elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Exercising Your Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>Depending on where you live, you may have the following rights with respect to your Personal Information under applicable data protection laws:</p>

We do not collect or process sensitive Personal Information outside of purposes permitted by law (such as section 7027(m) under the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations), so we do not offer the option to limit its use. We also do not profile you or other individuals in a manner that would result in legal or similarly significant effects, so we do not offer an opt out.</li>

</ul>
<p>To exercise any of the privacy rights afforded to you under applicable data protection laws, e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@yello.co">privacy@yello.co</a> or <a href="mailto:privacy@wayup.com">privacy@wayup.com</a> (for Yello Sourcing or WayUp-related inquiries) or submit a request through our web form <a href="https://learn.yello.co/Privacy-Policy-Opt-Out-2023_LP---Privacy-Policy-Opt-Out.html">here</a>.

However, should you withdraw your consent or object to processing of your Personal Information, or if you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, we may be unable to provide some, or all, of our Services to you.</p>
<p>Only you, or an authorized agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your Personal Information. We must verify your identity before fulfilling your requests, and if we cannot verify your identity, we may request additional information from you. If you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of another person, we will also need to verify your identity, which may require proof of your written authorization or evidence of a power of attorney. We endeavor to respond to requests within the time period required by applicable law. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your requests unless they are excessive or repetitive. If we determine that a request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. We may deny certain requests, or only fulfill some in part, as permitted or required by law. If you are not satisfied with the resolution of your request and you are afforded a right to appeal such decision, you will be notified of our appeal process in our response to your request.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: Simply deleting our application from your mobile device will not initiate any of the above rights or terminate your account or Services. Your Services registration and account can only be terminated by following the procedures described in the corresponding Terms and Conditions. To execute your privacy rights, please follow the procedures described above.</p>
<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit any Personal Information from children, as defined under applicable law, without verified written parental consent, and we have no actual knowledge of selling such Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child, we will promptly take steps to delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@yello.co">privacy@yello.co</a> or <a href="mailto:privacy@wayup.com">privacy@wayup.com</a> (for Yello Sourcing or WayUp-related inquiries).</p>

<p><em>Legal Bases for Processing</em></p>
<p>Our legal basis for processing Personal Information depends on the Personal Information involved and the context in which we process it.&nbsp; Where Yello acts as a controller, we process your Personal Information: with your consent; where necessary to perform a contract; to comply with our legal obligations; and where doing so is in our legitimate interests (including the purposes described in this Notice) and such interests are not outweighed by your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><em>Special Category Data</em></p>
<p>Yello only collects Special Category Data where we have a lawful basis for doing so that is permitted under Article 9 of the GDPR, specifically within the employment context. If you apply for a job with us or through us, we may collect data that reveals your racial or ethnic origin, trade union membership, sexual orientation, or health to fulfill our obligations, exercise our rights, and otherwise administer our employment relationship with you (including initial recruitment and hiring, where applicable). For example, we may collect health information to make reasonable disability accommodations; immigration information to verify your right to work in a particular jurisdiction; and data points like your race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation to monitor equal opportunities. Please refrain from sending us any Special Category Data outside this employment context.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
