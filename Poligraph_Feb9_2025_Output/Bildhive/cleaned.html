                        (d) Google integrations. By using the ‘Gmail

                        links from your email, email labels, email bodies,

                        Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy
                        Policy, if you provide the Platform access to your
                        Google data, Bildhive’s use of that data will be
                        subject to the following additional restrictions:
                        (i) Bildhive will only use access to read, write,
                        modify or control Gmail message bodies (including
                        attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to
                        provide a web email client that allows users to
                        compose, send, read, and process emails and to
                        enhance the email experience for productivity
                        purposes, (ii) Bildhive will not transfer your Gmail
                        data to others unless doing so is necessary to

                        applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition,
                        or sale of assets; (iii) Bildhive will not use this
                        Gmail data for serving advertisements, (iv) Bildhive
                        will not allow humans to read this data unless we
                        have your affirmative consent for specific messages,
                        doing so is necessary for security purposes such as
                        investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law,
                        or for Bildhive’s internal operations when the data
                        has been aggregated and anonymized; and (v)
                        Bildhive's use and transfer to any other application
                        of information received from Google APIs will adhere
                        to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" target="_">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>.

                        (e) Public Forums. Public forums, such as Bildhives’
                        social channels, allow you to upload and share
                        comments or feedback publicly with other Users. Any
                        information that you submit through such public
                        forums is not confidential, and Bildhive may use it
                        for any purpose (including in testimonials or other
                        Bildhive marketing materials). Any information you
                        post openly in these ways will be available to the
                        public at large and potentially accessible through
                        third-party search engines. Such information can be
                        read, collected and/or used by other Users, and it
                        could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
                    </p> <p>
                        (f) Laws and Jurisdictions. Notwithstanding anything
                        to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may
                        preserve or disclose your Information and Data if we
                        believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply
                        with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect
                        the safety of any person; to address fraud, security
                        or technical issues; or to protect our or any other
                        person’s or entity’s rights or property. However,
                        nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit
                        any legal defenses or objections that you may have
                        to a third party’s, including a government’s,
                        request to disclose your Information and Data.
                    </p> <p>
                        (g) Sale of Business. We may disclose Information
                        and Data to the acquiror or its agents in the course
                        of the sale of our business. If we do this, the
                        disclosure will be subject to confidentiality
                        arrangements customary in such transactions. In
                        addition, if the ownership of all or substantially
                        all of our business changes, or all or some of our
                        assets are sold as part of a bankruptcy or other
                        proceeding, we may transfer your information to the
                        new owner so that the services can continue to
                        operate. In such case, your information would remain
                        subject to the commitments contained in this Privacy
                        Policy until the acquiring party updates it. If such
                        transfer is subject to additional mandatory
                        restrictions under applicable laws or agreements,
                        Bildhive will comply with those restrictions.

                        the Platform in connection with an organization, or

                        can export data associated with the domain they
                        manage.

                        (i) Storing and Processing Your Information and

                        collect may be stored or processed outside of the
                        jurisdiction it is received. When that occurs, we
                        continue to protect the Information and Data with
                        appropriate safeguards and data export requirements,
                        but it may be subject to the legal jurisdiction of
                        those countries and governmental authorities in
                        those countries.
