It also serves as a way to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.&nbsp;</p><p data-positional-element-id="19">‍</p><p data-positional-element-id="20"><strong>About Village Labs</strong><br></p><p data-positional-element-id="21">Welcome to Village Labs! We build an AI&nbsp;called Atlas to make your team faster, more connected and radically more productive. If you have any questions about any of this, you can contact us at: support@villagelabs.co, and we’ll do our best to help. The Village website, products, APIs, technology, and services are owned and provided by Village Platforms, Inc. In this Privacy Policy, we won’t use the full corporate name. Instead, we’ll refer to the company and product as “Village,” "Village Labs," or "Atlas." And when we say “we,” “us,” the “Company” or “our,” that’s also referring to the company. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (the “Terms”) carefully because they - along with other posted policies, rules, and guidelines - govern your use of and interaction with our website (www.villagelabs.co) (the “Site”), the other features and software and technologies we provide, and our communications with you.<br></p><p data-positional-element-id="22"><strong>About Atlas</strong></p><p data-positional-element-id="23">Atlas makes your team radically faster and more productive.</p><p data-positional-element-id="24">How does Atlas do that?&nbsp;It gives you and your team perfect visibility into individual and team progress, plans, and problems across your company by connecting to all the tools your team uses to get work done – Slack, Google Docs, Linear, Github, HubSpot, etc – and using custom data pipelines and LLMs to synthesize and summarize the underlying content and data into updates and summaries on individual and team work, goals, projects, problems and blockers.&nbsp;</p><p data-positional-element-id="25">This includes:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Chief of Staff: </strong>AI and Automations that connect to your data to reduce management admin, provide automated summaries of team performance, plans, blockers and redundancies, as well as alerts, reminders and comms to keep you and your team productive.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Leadership Insights: </strong>real-time key performance metrics and alerts across your organization to better understand things like employee engagement and where resources are being allocated. </li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Directory:</strong> an engaging way to keep your team connected through an org directory with personalized profiles.

Atlas does this by automating reporting across connected data sources for this like individual and team updates, or topical digests on projects or problems. To make these Terms easier to read, we use the word “Services” here to collectively describe and encompass our Site, the other features and software and technologies we provide, and our communications with you. These Terms govern your access to and use of our Services, whether as a Site visitor, Account holder, End User, or as a technology development partner who accesses our Services (each a “User,” collectively “Users”).</p><p data-positional-element-id="28">‍<br></p><p data-positional-element-id="29"><strong>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</strong></p><p data-positional-element-id="30">Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.

End Users should be aware that your personal data may also be separately collected and processed by the Customer who invited you use the Village Services or create a Village account and that such collection and processing of your personal data by that business is subject to their own privacy policy, which we encourage you to read and understand. Your relationship with that business and their processing of your personal information is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p><p data-positional-element-id="33">To the extent you were invited to use our Services by one of our Customers or any third party business that you are associated with, their collection and processing of your Personal Data is governed by their respective Privacy Policies, which we encourage you to read and understand.&nbsp;</p><p data-positional-element-id="34"><strong>Information That We Collect</strong></p><p data-positional-element-id="35">This section describes the different types of Personal Data we may obtain about you.<br></p><h6><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information that You Provide Directly</strong><br></h6><ul role="list"><li><strong>Sign Up Information</strong>: When you sign up to create an account, we collect and retain certain information that can be used to identify you (“<strong>Personal Data</strong>”), including, in the case of account creation: your first and last name, email addresses, and phone number, and profile photo (“Sign Up Information”).
