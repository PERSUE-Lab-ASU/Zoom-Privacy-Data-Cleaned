This setup allows for a more accurate tracking of Users by associating that User with the same ID over various sessions and devices. It is set up in a way that doesn\u2019t allow Google to personally identify an individual or permanently identify a particular device.\nThe User ID extension might make it possible to connect Data from Google Analytics with other Data about the User collected by Introwise.\nThe opt-out link below will only opt you out for the device you are on, but not from tracking performed independently by the Owner.
