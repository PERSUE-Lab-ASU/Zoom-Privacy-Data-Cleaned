Second, they have a right to know: </p><ol role="list"><li><strong>What specific pieces of information a business has about the consumer; </strong></li><li><strong>Categories of personal information it has collected about the consumer;</strong></li><li><strong>Categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;</strong></li><li><strong>Categories of personal information that the business sold or disclosed for a business purpose about the consumer;</strong></li><li><strong>Categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and</strong></li><li><strong>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information. </strong></li></ol><p>In addition, California consumers can request that the personal information a business has collected about them be deleted from the business’s systems and records.</p><p>Company may be considered a covered business under the CCPA as it collects and processes the personal information of California consumers. This Privacy Policy provides the required notices to California consumers. The CCPA also prohibits covered businesses from providing discriminatory treatment to California consumers if they exercise their rights under the Act. &nbsp;</p><p>We do not rent or sell your personally identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone number and credit card information) to unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes. We may share your information with third parties to provide products and services you have requested, when we have your consent, or as described in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;</p><p>To make a “request to know” or request to delete your personal information, send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@joincabinet.com"><strong>info@joincabinet.com</strong></a> (Please put either “Request to Know” or “Request to Delete” in the subject heading of your email.) </p><p>If and to the extent we are considered a covered business under the CCPA: We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days along with a description of what steps we will take to verify and respond.

Each browser communicates "Do Not Track" signals to websites differently, making it unworkable to honor each and every request correctly. In order to alleviate any communication error between browsers and our Services, we do not respond to or honor "Do Not Track" signals at this time. As the technology and communication between browser and website improves, we may elect in our discretion to reevaluate the ability to honor "Do Not Track" signals and may make changes to our policy. You may adjust your browser or operating system settings to limit this tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Services or take full advantage of all of our offerings. &nbsp;Check the “Help” menu of your browser or operating system to learn how to adjust your tracking settings or cookie preferences.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect the personal information in question. If we collected your personal data or information with your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. </p><p>You also have the right to:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Access your personal data or information;</strong></li><li><strong>Delete, or request deletion of, your personal data or information;</strong></li><li><strong>Object to or restrict processing of your personal information; </strong></li><li><strong>Request portability of your personal information;</strong></li><li><strong>Complain to your local data protection authority at any time;</strong></li><li><strong>Object to automated decision making; and</strong></li><li><strong>Update your personal data or information.</strong></li></ul><p>To withdraw consent or exercise these rights, please contact us as described in the “How to Contact Us” Section below.</p><p>Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p><p> </p><p>If we ask you to provide personal data to us to comply with a legal requirement or enter into a contract, we will inform you of this and let you know whether providing us with your personal data is required and if not, the consequences of not sharing your personal data with us. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our or a third party's legitimate interests and those interests are not already listed above (see "Information Use" section), we will let you know what those legitimate interests are.</p><p><strong>DATA STORAGE AND RETENTION</strong></p><p>Your personal information is stored on servers in the United States and may also be stored or processed in other countries by our service providers, if and to the extent compliant with law. &nbsp;You understand and agree that We may collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process the information you provide as described in this Privacy Statement even if you are from an area outside the United States. &nbsp;Your personal information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities or to respond to judicial process in the United States. We will retain your personal information for as long as it is needed to provide you with the Services, or to fulfill any legal or contractual obligations we may have.</p><p>If you are a resident of the EEA: Your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different than those in your country and may not be as protective.</p><p><strong>How to Contact Us</strong></p><p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or its implementation, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@joincabinet.com"><strong>info@joincabinet.com</strong></a>. &nbsp;If you believe your information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. &nbsp;We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests for information residing on backup tapes). </p><p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy </strong></p><p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should review this Policy periodically. &nbsp;Your continued use of any Services constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. </p><p><strong>Last Updated: July 30, 2024</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="section_trial mint"><div class="wrapper"><div class="cta-text-with-button"><div class="heading-pair-wrap gap-24"><h3>Enjoy a 14-day free trial</h3><p>Our team will be there to answer any questions and support you along the way.</p></div><div class="no-shrink"><a href="/pricing" class="button emerald w-button">Get started for free</a></div></div></div></div><noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-W2QQW4P"
