During our account registration process, we will collect a login name, password, and an email address from you, and we may collect other information from You that will be shown in the form you submit. You must provide all of this information in order to obtain an account. After completing our registration form, You will receive a welcome email describing Your new Localist account, and how to access that account. You may, at Your option, also store Your social media credentials as part of Your account with our Service.<br><br>We may also allow You to login using a social media account with a third party (e.g. Facebook® or Twitter® or a similar account). When You do this, the third party shares with us certain information through their Application Program Interface (API). We do not control what information such third party may provide us, and we do not control whether such information is encrypted. We may store the information provided by such third party on our own site, to facilitate the login process, and to link our site to the third party site in accordance with their API. We will conform our actions to any limitations or requirements of such third party in use of their API. We recommend that You review the privacy and information / data collection and use policies of the third party API provider.<br><br>ACCOUNT SUBSCRIPTIONS<br>If You choose to continue service with Localist via a paid account, Localist will collect personally identifiable information (credit card number, billing address, phone number and other relevant account information) and send this information to our billing system's secure server in order to process Your recurring invoices. This information is only used to verify credit card authenticity, make charges that You have authorized, and issue invoices as per Your service agreement. Upon discontinuation of Localist service, subject to the other provisions below (for example, any legal obligation we have to keep such information) Your information will be deleted in our billing system (however, some data may remain in our backup system until it has been purged through regular backup rotation).<br><br>If we are unable to process Your subscription for a given month, this information, along with Your account information, may be used to contact you.<br><br>TELL-A-FRIEND TOOLS<br>Localist provides a number of tools that will allow You to promote Your calendar (or Content on Your calendar) over email and other electronic communication means. Email addresses and user IDs on other systems that allow such communication that is entered into these forms are not stored in our database, but may be stored in our system logs in text format to assist us in tracking down abusive users (users flooding the system), or users using these tools for spamming or other violations of our Terms of Service or Applicable Law (as defined in the Terms of Service). We will never contact addresses logged in this manner (however, the communication that emanates from use of this service may contain link backs to our site and may contain other content we place on or in such communications). The email sent through any of these mechanisms is a one time email only.<br><br>HOSTED CALENDARS<br>Users hosting calendars with Localist are given tools that may ask You to optionally enter Your email address when making comments on their platform, or contacting them through their platform. Users on Localist may manipulate the HTML code on their site directly, there are opportunities available for a malicious user to inject code that would log Your information before it reaches our system. In addition, once in our system, platform users will have the opportunity to review and modify any information entered into their platform. Localist does not have full control over how members run their individual calendars, nor do we monitor or test that usage for compliance with our policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any hosted Localist calendar that You do not control. Therefore You should check that You trust the controller of a particular platform before submitting personally identifiable information on that site.<br><br>SERVER LOGS<br>When accessing web pages on the Localist.com domain, Localist may log Your IP address, access URL, time of access, browser type, referral URL and other "meta data" that an internet packet typically contains, in order to provide us with internal information regarding site traffic statistics ("Site Usage Data"). This information may also be used by Localist to identify users who are using the service for spam or other activity that is deemed in conflict with our Terms of Service or Applicable Law.<br><br>We may de-identify and then aggregate Site Usage Data - and if we do this, such aggregated, de-identified data is never linked back to any of Your personally identifiable information. However, as we maintain Site Usage Data for our own internal purposes, if we receive a legal request for such data and we comply with such request, Your identified information contained in Site Usage Data might be required to be disclosed.<br>‍</p><h5>‍<br>SECTION 2</h5><h2>Uses of Information</h2><p>Localist collects the aforementioned personally identifiable information in order to provide You with a service that allows You to maintain an online presence. Various features in our calendar management system will, at Your discretion, display Your name, or adjust the date and time of events based on Your locale or other information. The Localist Administration interface will give You an option with respect to some of Your personally identifiable information before it is presented on Your website. We may add or change the types of information that is within the control of each user through the Localist Administration.<br><br>Localist uses information collected through its Service to send out notifications regarding service related issues (such as maintenance periods, billing problems, account expirations, and other items that may impact service). We do not send contact information unless the matter is deemed urgent, and most communication will occur through Your Localist Administration interface. We also may use Your information to send You messages regarding new Service or other products from Localist, but will not share this information with third parties for any marketing purposes.<br><br>Information collected through our service logs is used only to identify potential cases of abuse, non compliance with our Terms of Service, and Applicable law, and establish statistical information regarding website traffic. This statistical information is not aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.<br><br>Localist, Corp. is the sole owner of information collected on http://www.localist.com/.<br>‍</p><h5>‍<br>SECTION 3</h5><h2>Information Security</h2><p>We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of industry-standard access controls. Secure passwords, SSL encryption, disk-based encryption for some sensitive financial data and passwords, firewalls, and other measures are in place that helps us to protect Your data. This data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement.<br><br>If You have any questions about security on our website, You can review our hosting FAQ or send us a support request using our support system.<br><br>‍</p><h5>SECTION 4</h5><h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2><p>CHANGING INFORMATION<br>All information that Localist stores related to Your account, including any subscription billing information, is accessible through Your Localist Administration interface. You may use this interface to adjust Your information at any time, and we encourage You to keep this information up to date so that Your customer service requests and billing processes operate efficiently.<br><br>REMOVING INFORMATION<br>To remove Your personally identifiable information from our system, email Your account for a deactivation request to support@localist.com. Your personal information will be promptly marked for data purge, though Your actual login name will remain reserved on our system until re-collection. If You wish to only remove Your billing subscription information, cancel Your paid account. Both of these removals can be accessed through Your Localist Administration interface. After account de-activation, we may delete Your personal data (or we may elect to retain it, in a form that is not accessible except to us, for period of time in case You might re-activate or in the case of a dispute), however (a) we may maintain transactional data (e.g. order history, service acceptance communications, and other data we deem necessary if any dispute about our service might arise); and (b) we will not initiate a purge from backup locations or tapes - and Your data may reside on those locations until the tape or location is overwritten or marked for deletion and then deleted.<br>‍</p><h5>‍<br>SECTION 5</h5><h2>Communications from Localist, Corp.</h2><p>SERVICE-RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS<br>We will send You service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send You an email. Generally, You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If You do not wish to receive them, You have the option to deactivate Your account.<br><br>OTHER MESSAGES<br>We may also send You messages from time to time about new features or Service that we will offer to our users. You may opt-out of these communications at any time by clicking on the link at the bottom of our communications to you, or by changing Your preferences in Your profile.<br><br>CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>Upon issuing a customer support request to Localist, we may use Your information and email address to contact You regarding Your inquiry.<br>‍</p><h5>‍<br>SECTION 6</h5><h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2><p>AGGREGATE INFORMATION (NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE)<br>We may share de-identified aggregated demographic information about our user base with our advertisers. This information does not identify individual users. This information contains statistics related to traffic and the geographic location of our customers. We also may share de-identified aggregated user information with third parties who help us to analyze our user base to improve the Service.<br><br>We do not maintain a database that directly links aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. However, if we are required to provide logs and data pursuant to a legal demand such as under subpoena, a person may be able to link aggregated user data and personally identifiable information by other techniques.<br><br>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br>Localist employs third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include credit card processing, email service providers, data metrics and analysis companies and customer service outsource companies. These service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but our agreements with them provide that they would be in breach of such agreements if they use such data for any other purpose. We expect such companies to uphold their contracts, however, You agree that we are not liable to You if a service provider of ours breaches our agreement and misuses Your data (You will have a claim directly against them, and we will cooperate reasonably in such claim).<br><br>We may release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Localist, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br><br>SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS AND MARKETING INFORMATION<br>Localist may use social media and electronic marketing to display dynamically or statically generated content on the site, and the content displayed may be tailored for You based on Your use of the site and information We have about You; provided that, except to the extent that you have connected to our site using Social Media Tools (defined below), and then only as described below, we do not transmit Your personally identifiable information to such third parties, rather, we take information we have about the third party content provider and we take information we have about You and we determine which content to present to You.<br><br>"Social Media Tools" refers to the software, scripts and functionality that some services (e.g. Facebook® or Twitter® or a similar site) provide to users to integrate their social media interactions across platforms and sites. We may provide You with the ability to make use of Social Media Tools on our site. If we do this, we will comply with the rules and regulations of the service provider; however, we do not review or otherwise vouch for such Social Media Tools, nor do we control what those other sites do with the data that is generated by use of such Social Media Tools (in some cases we may not even know what data they have access to, as they can run such Social Media Tools in scripts and programs that we cannot see or monitor). By using Social Media Tools, you are agreeing that your personal data, which may include personally identifiable data, and which may also include Site Usage Data, can be shared with the provider of the applicable Social Media Tools that you are using, but this agreement is only to the extent of the actual functionality of the particular Social Media Tool You have enabled.<br><br>‍</p><h5>SECTION 7</h5><h2>Log Files</h2><p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<br><br>We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information (other than Your IP address).<br><br>‍</p><h5>SECTION 8</h5><h2>Cookies</h2><p>Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies or locally stored objects ("cookies"), stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us 'remember' information about Your preferences and passwords and allow You to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself. Members who disable cookies will not be able to use the Service, as they are required to maintain Your login to our service within a browser session. Disabling cookies does not prevent You from accessing websites published under our system, though some features of those sites may be degraded.<br><br>These cookies can be tied back to personally identifiable information only in the event that You are logged in to our Service. If You are logged in to our Service, the cookies on Your computer will uniquely identify Your account within our system. We do not share cookies our site places on Your computer with third parties. You may disable cookies but portions of our site may not operate correctly. We are not liable for any loss of use or degradation in the Services if cookies are not permitted to be stored.<br><br>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Localist, Corp. only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br><br>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers and Social Media Tool providers) may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See Third Party Advertisers.<br><br>‍</p><h5>SECTION 9</h5><h2>Communications Decency Act Notice; other laws; no users under 13 years of age</h2><p>Communications Decency Act Notice.
