This policy regarding our privacy practices (the\r\n  \"Privacy Policy\") lays out how we manage and treat the information we collect\r\n  when you visit and use edredo.com (the \"Site\") and/or our iOS and Android\r\n  mobile applications (collectively with the Site, the \"Services or/and\r\n  Product\").\r\n</p><p>\r\n  Edredo is a subsidiary of Opensense labs, a technology company that empowers\r\n  companies to build beautiful technological solutions and find and grow their\r\n  audience. We may share non-personal information with our supporting companies\r\n  for purposes such as product improvements, research and analysis, and to help\r\n  them provide you with more relevant experiences. When you register and use the\r\n  Services, you also give your consent to the collection, transfer,\r\n  manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other uses of your information as\r\n  described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.\r\n</p><h2><strong>What this Privacy Policy covers</strong></h2><p>\r\n  This Privacy Policy covers our treatment and management of information\r\n  gathered about you by us and by our partners or that we share with our\r\n  partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties\r\n  that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any\r\n  third-party websites, services, applications, or businesses (\"Third-Party\r\n  Services\"). We don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies\r\n  of those Third-Party Services. Although we carefully choose our third-party\r\n  services and ensure that they have equal respect toward your privacy.\r\n</p><h2><strong>Account Information</strong></h2><p>\r\n  When you create an account on the Services (an \"Account\"), we'll ask you for\r\n  information such as, but not limited to, your name, username, password, age,\r\n  location, profession, your picture, and email address, which is hereby\r\n  referred to as \"Account Information.\" We may use Account Information, alone or\r\n  together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as\r\n  by personalization. We use your email address to verify your Account and to\r\n  communicate with you, as described in more detail below. We also allow users\r\n  to look for their friends by email address/username.\r\n</p><h2><strong>Information about Your Accounts on Third-Party Services</strong></h2><p>\r\n  You can link your Account to certain Third-Party Services. In order to do so,\r\n  you may provide us with your username or other credentials for a Third-Party\r\n  Service, and you may then be required to log into that Service. Upon the\r\n  completion of this process, we will receive a token that allows us to access\r\n  your account on that service so that we can, for example, integrate your\r\n  account with that third-party service if you ask us to do so. We do not\r\n  receive or store your passwords for your Third-Party Service accounts.\r\n</p><h2><strong>Information Obtained from Third-Party Services</strong></h2><p>\r\n  In certain cases, we may partner with Third-Party Services that may provide\r\n  information about you. Such information could include, for example, your\r\n  gender, depending on whether you have disclosed that information to that third\r\n  party and made it available for other products/services to access. Depending\r\n  on the extent of this information obtained, we may use it to develop new\r\n  Services or to improve or enhance the current Product/Services.\r\n</p><h2><strong>Email Communications with Us</strong></h2><p>\r\n  As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other\r\n  communications from us. Product and administrative communications relating to\r\n  your Account (e.g., for Account recovery or password reset) are considered\r\n  part of the Services and your Account, from which you may not be able to\r\n  opt-out. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of\r\n  either from your Account Settings page or by using the unsubscribe link in the\r\n  emails themselves, depending on the source and method of email communication.\r\n</p><p><strong>User Content:</strong> By default, all sharing through the Services is\r\n  public, and when you provide us with content, it is published so that anyone\r\n  can view it. This means you should assume that anything you publish is\r\n  publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected specific content to be\r\n  shared privately. There are certain exceptions where a few content types, such\r\n  as direct email messages and comments, can only be viewed by their intended\r\n  recipients.<br>\r\n  However, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with another\r\n  user may be posted publicly by that user. Content published and shared\r\n  publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose\r\n  any privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition,\r\n  information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet,\r\n  including through actions or features native to the Services.\r\n</p><p><strong>Indigenous Features:</strong> The Services allow you to perform native\r\n  actions that are integral to our products, such as liking a post, reposting a\r\n  post, commenting on a post, and following a post.

There are exceptions where some or all of these\r\n  actions, such as commenting on a post, can be done anonymously.
