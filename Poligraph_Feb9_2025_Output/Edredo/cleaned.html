                    Welcome! Your privacy is critically important to us. We've
                    created this page to provide answers to questions that you might
                    have about our privacy practices about Edredo and its learning
                    management system.

  Edredo. ("Edredo," "we," "us," or "our") is a cloud-based learning management
  system and an academic networking platform where users create, consume, and
  engage with learning content. Edredo takes the private nature of your
  information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the
  "Privacy Policy") lays out how we manage and treat the information we collect
  when you visit and use edredo.com (the "Site") and/or our iOS and Android
  mobile applications (collectively with the Site, the "Services or/and
  Product").
</p><p>
  Edredo is a subsidiary of Opensense labs, a technology company that empowers
  companies to build beautiful technological solutions and find and grow their
  audience. We may share non-personal information with our supporting companies
  for purposes such as product improvements, research and analysis, and to help
  them provide you with more relevant experiences. When you register and use the
  Services, you also give your consent to the collection, transfer,
  manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other uses of your information as
  described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What this Privacy Policy covers</strong></h2><p>
  This Privacy Policy covers our treatment and management of information
  gathered about you by us and by our partners or that we share with our
  partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties
  that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any
  third-party websites, services, applications, or businesses ("Third-Party
  Services"). We don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies
  of those Third-Party Services. Although we carefully choose our third-party
  services and ensure that they have equal respect toward your privacy.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Account Information</strong></h2><p>
  When you create an account on the Services (an "Account"), we'll ask you for
  information such as, but not limited to, your name, username, password, age,
  location, profession, your picture, and email address, which is hereby
  referred to as "Account Information." We may use Account Information, alone or
  together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as
  by personalization. We use your email address to verify your Account and to
  communicate with you, as described in more detail below. We also allow users
  to look for their friends by email address/username.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Information about Your Accounts on Third-Party Services</strong></h2><p>
  You can link your Account to certain Third-Party Services. In order to do so,
  you may provide us with your username or other credentials for a Third-Party
  Service, and you may then be required to log into that Service. Upon the
  completion of this process, we will receive a token that allows us to access
  your account on that service so that we can, for example, integrate your
  account with that third-party service if you ask us to do so. We do not
  receive or store your passwords for your Third-Party Service accounts.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Information Obtained from Third-Party Services</strong></h2><p>
  In certain cases, we may partner with Third-Party Services that may provide
  information about you. Such information could include, for example, your
  gender, depending on whether you have disclosed that information to that third
  party and made it available for other products/services to access. Depending
  on the extent of this information obtained, we may use it to develop new
  Services or to improve or enhance the current Product/Services.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Email Communications with Us</strong></h2><p>
  As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other
  communications from us. Product and administrative communications relating to
  your Account (e.g., for Account recovery or password reset) are considered
  part of the Services and your Account, from which you may not be able to
  opt-out. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of
  either from your Account Settings page or by using the unsubscribe link in the
  emails themselves, depending on the source and method of email communication.
</p><p><strong>User Content:</strong> By default, all sharing through the Services is
  public, and when you provide us with content, it is published so that anyone
  can view it. This means you should assume that anything you publish is
  publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected specific content to be
  shared privately. There are certain exceptions where a few content types, such
  as direct email messages and comments, can only be viewed by their intended
  recipients.<br>
  However, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with another
  user may be posted publicly by that user. Content published and shared
  publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose
  any privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition,
  information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet,
  including through actions or features native to the Services.
</p><p><strong>Indigenous Features:</strong> The Services allow you to perform native
  actions that are integral to our products, such as liking a post, reposting a
  post, commenting on a post, and following a post. All these actions are
  public, meaning anyone can view the details of a post, such as who liked it,
  reposted it, or replied to it. There are exceptions where some or all of these
  actions, such as commenting on a post, can be done anonymously. We use
  information about these indigenous actions to improve the Services,
  personalize your Edredo account and experience, and provide you with new posts
  relevant to your interests, better search results, and more relevant
  advertising.
</p><p>
  Information Related to Use of the Services/data collected via technology: We
  collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an
  Account. This information is collected in our log files each time you interact
  with the Services. We use internal tools and third-party applications and
  services, such as Google Analytics and Apache Unomi, to collect and analyze
  this information. Some of this information may be associated with your
  Internet Protocol Address ("IP Address"), connected with your Account, or used
  in aggregate form for statistical purposes. We also collect your IP Address
  when you make a post or add any content, including anonymous posts or
  comments. This information helps us enhance, improve, protect, and develop new
  Services, personalize content, provide targeted advertising, improve search
  results, identify trending or popular content, fight spam, malware, and
  identity theft, and ensure legal and safety compliance.<br><br>

  information about your approximate location by converting your IP Address into
  a rough geolocation.

  generate, or assign a unique identifier to your mobile device for the purposes
  described above in "Information Related to Use of the Services."
</p><p>
  With Whom Your Information Is Shared: We never share information we receive
  from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we
  have given you prior notice that the information will be shared and with whom,
  as stated in this Privacy Policy; or (c) the information is aggregate
  information or other non-identifying information.
</p><p>
  Information You Share with Third-Party Services: You may access Third-Party
  Services through the Services, such as by clicking on external links. You may
  also choose to share information you provide to us, such as blog posts,
  courses, and quizzes, with those Third-Party Services (e.g., by sharing posts
  on Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy only governs information we
  collect, and you are responsible for reading and understanding the privacy
  policies of those Third-Party Services.
</p><p><strong>Information Shared with Other Third Parties:</strong> We may share or
  disclose non-private information, aggregate information, or other
  non-personally-identifying information with individuals and entities we do
  business with.
