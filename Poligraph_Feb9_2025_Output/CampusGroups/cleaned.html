<p style="margin-bottom: .6em;"><strong style="color:#444; ">Last Updated: August 10, 2020</strong></p>

	

<p>
At Novalsys, Inc. ("<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>") we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we look after your personal information when you visit and use our community engagement platform at <a href="https://www.campusgroups.com">https://www.campusgroups.com</a>, our mobile sites or applications, or other dedicated CampusGroups sites, mobile or other applications designed and hosted by us for your Organization (collectively, the "<strong>Site</strong>") and where you access and use any of the tools and features that we provide through the Site (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). This Privacy Policy also tells you about your privacy rights with respect to your information. 
</p>

<h3>USE OF THE SITE AND THE SERVICES</h3>

<h4>Authorized Users</h4> 
<p>
If a profile which you did not create yourself exists on this Site it is because the school or university identified on the Site (the "<strong>School</strong>") or other club, group or organization (together with the School, an "<strong>Organization</strong>") has shared certain information with us due to your affiliation with the Organization (whether as a registered student, member of staff, alumni, parent, partner, employee, club member or other third party connected with the Organization and authorized to access the Services).  If we have received such information from your Organization, your Organization has authorized your access to, and use of the Site and Services and for purposes of this Privacy Policy, you will be referred to as an "<strong>Authorized User</strong>". As an Authorized User, your Organization is responsible for and administers your CampusGroups account and is also responsible for the collection and use of any data that you submit or provide through the Services (including any messages, files or other content submitted through the Services) (collectively, "<strong>User Contributions</strong>"). We have a separate agreement with your Organization which governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the "Organization Agreement"). In addition to this Privacy Policy, your Organization may have additional policies which apply in relation to your use of the Service.
</p>  

<h4>Independent Users</h4>  
<p>
If you have created your own account on the Site to access certain Services that we provide to an Organization under an Organization Agreement (including, for example, registering or purchasing tickets for an event hosted by the Organization) , for purposes of this Privacy Policy, you will be referred to as an "<strong>Independent User</strong>".  As an Independent User, the Organization is still responsible for and administers your CampusGroups account and will be responsible for the collection and use of any data that you submit or provide through the Services (as set out above in the case of Authorized Users). <u>Please note:</u> your data will be shared with the Organization and will be processed in accordance with their Privacy Policy as well as ours. Click <a href="">here</a> for a copy of your Organization’s Privacy Policy.
</p> 

<h4>Trial Users</h4> 
<p>
If you have created your own account on the Site following a request for a demo or other trial of the Site and the Services and there is no Organization Agreement in place, for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, you will be referred to as a "<strong>Trial User</strong>". As a Trial User, we administer your CampusGroups account and will be responsible for the collection and use of any data that you submit or provide through the Services. Novalsys will not share your data with your Organization.
</p>

<p>
Authorized Users, Independent Users and Trial Users, shall be referred to collectively as "<strong>End Users</strong>".

<h3>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h3>
<p>
Novalsys is based in the United States.  We may therefore transfer your personal information to countries other than the one in which you live. For EEA data subjects, this may involve transferring your information outside the EEA. 
</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR END USERS LOCATED IN THE EEA</h3>
<p>
For users of the Site  located in the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>"), data protection laws refer to the concepts of "data controllers" and "data processors". A data controller decides how and why your information is used. A data processor is responsible for processing your information on behalf of the data controller and does so only in accordance with the controller’s instructions.  
</p>
<p>
As a <strong>data processor</strong> we may use your Data in accordance with the written instructions of your Organization (as data controller), including any applicable terms in the Organization Agreement, and as required to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation. 
</p>
<p>
As a <strong>data controller</strong>, we will use your Data:
	</p><ul>
		<li>Where we have your explicit consent (for example, to collect and store Special Categories of Personal Data).</li> 
		<li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
		<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate business interests in operating the Site and providing the Services (including carrying data analytics on the Site and the Services or the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy).</li>
		<li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li> 
	</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
We offer EU Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our Organizations that operate in the European Union or whose Authorized Users are located in the European Union. 
</p>
<h4>Your rights</h4> 
<p>
Individuals located in the EEA have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal information. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, you may have the right to:
	</p><ul>
		<li><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information the data controller holds about you and to check that they are lawfully processing it.</li>
		<li><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information held about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information the data controller holds about you corrected.</li>
		<li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask the data controller to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for them continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask the data controller to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
		<li><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal information where the data controller is relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where they are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
		<li><strong>Request the restriction of processing</strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask the data controller to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want them to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
		<li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information to another party.</li>
	</ul>
