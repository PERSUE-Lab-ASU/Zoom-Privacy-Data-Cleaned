This is a contract mandated by data privacy laws that guarantees that they process personal data of our website visitors only based on our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Data Protection</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party access.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the \u201cController\u201d in the GDPR)</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">The data processing controller on this website is:</span></p><p>Holistic Integration GmbH<br>Data Protection Office: Florian Dotterweich<br>Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfe 8<br>71229 Leonberg<br>Germany</p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Phone: +49 7152 569 5190<br>E-mail: info@universe-control.com</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Storage Duration</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Designation of a Data Protection Officer as mandated by Law</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">We have appointed a data protection officer for our company.</span></p><p>Holistic Integration GmbH</p><p>Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfe 8<br>71229 Leonberg</p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Phone: +49 7152 569 5190<br>E-mail: datenschutz@universe-control.com</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Information on Data Transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a data protection perspective non-secure non-EU countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these processing activities.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Revocation of your Consent to the Processing of Data</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Right to object to the Collection of Data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME.

The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Right to Data Portability</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>SSL and/or TLS Encryption</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from \u201chttp://\u201d to \u201chttps://\u201d and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Encrypted Payment Transactions on this Website</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g. account number if you give us the authority to debit your bank account) with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with us, this information is required to process payments.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard, debit to your bank account) are processed exclusively via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from \u201chttp://\u201d to \u201chttps://\u201d and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be able to read the payment information you share with us.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Information about, rectification and eradication of Data</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data.

To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:</span></p><ul><li><span lang=\"en-US\">In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</span></li><li><span lang=\"en-US\">If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.</span></li><li><span lang=\"en-US\">If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.</span></li><li><span lang=\"en-US\">If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.</span></li></ul><p><span lang=\"en-US\">If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data \u2013 with the exception of their archiving \u2013 may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Rejection of unsolicited E-mails</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">We herewith object to the use of contact information published in conjunction with the mandatory information to be provided in our Site Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have not expressly requested.

The individual social networks we use can be found below.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter etc. can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g. like buttons or banner ads). When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered. In detail:</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals.

The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g. consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Responsibility and Assertion of Rights</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-\u00e0-vis us as well as vis-\u00e0-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g. Facebook).</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the company policy of the respective provider.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\"><b>Storage Time</b></span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions \u2013 in particular, retention periods \u2013 remain unaffected.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-US\">We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social network operators for their own purposes.

General Information and Mandatory InformationData ProtectionThe operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party access.Information about the responsible party (referred to as the \u201cController\u201d in the GDPR)The data processing controller on this website is:Holistic Integration GmbHData Protection Office: Florian DotterweichStuttgarter Stra\u00dfe 871229 LeonbergGermanyPhone: +49 7152 569 5190E-mail: info@universe-control.comThe controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).Storage DurationUnless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies.

If these tools are active, your personal data may potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these processing activities.Revocation of your Consent to the Processing of DataA wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us.

You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from \u201chttp://\u201d to \u201chttps://\u201d and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be able to read the payment information you share with us.Information about, rectification and eradication of DataWithin the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data.

As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data \u2013 with the exception of their archiving \u2013 may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.Rejection of unsolicited E-mailsWe herewith object to the use of contact information published in conjunction with the mandatory information to be provided in our Site Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have not expressly requested. The operators of this website and its pages reserve the express right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of promotional information, for instance via SPAM messages.4.
