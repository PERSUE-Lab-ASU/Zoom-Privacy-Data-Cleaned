We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information.

These third-party services are not controlled by us. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each website and application with which they interact. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of, such other websites or applications.

If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent or that violates local applicable law, you may contact us as set forth below and if we learn that we have collected any child’s personal information in violation of applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such information.The software offers both paid and free pre-account states. When a user chooses to participate in the pre-account version, they are offered to be routed to different public Villas based on a user’s demographic. Parents, guardians, and teachers must provide appropriate supervision when a child uses the software. Not all activities are appropriate for everyone in every country, and it is the parent, guardian, or adult supervisor to approve and monitor children's usage of the software according to local jurisdiction. Be especially vigilant and aware that among kids using virtual reality multiplayer applications, bullying can be rampant as users, especially children, may feel free to use offensive language and conduct themselves in ways that break Villa's professional code of conduct while 'hiding' behind an avatar representation, a phenomenon also known as trolling. We have zero tolerance for bullying or any form of behavior that breaks professional code of conduct in public spaces and users that are caught in action in monitored public areas will be banned indefinitely, whether they are on the free or paid account. Inside a user's private org we do not and cannot monitor users, and therefore adult supervision is required at all times. We have both kicking and reporting mechanisms built to help the community spot bad actors, and facilitate adhering to the stated required professional code of conduct. For privacy reasons, an enterprise or personal account is strongly advised, rather than using the software in its pre-account trial state. &nbsp;It is up to the parent/guardian or manager to approve all use of the software by children. Additionally, signs are posted in public Villas advising parents and guardians to ensure that their kids have an account, so they can easily control which individuals may join a users' private account, thereby reducing encounters with strangers. Nevertheless a user may find their way to public Villas, and therefore it is the parent or guardian's responsibility to supervise all activities.</span><span class="c22">&nbsp;On Villa, many activities require a paid subscription, and some in-app activities may have a fee associated with them. It is up to the parent/guardian to password protect use of any payment mechanism to ensure proper use of the software.</span></p><h2 class="c8" id="h.qgyqx55fq69a"><span class="c15 c16">SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you are located in the European Union or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your personal information violates applicable law.</span></p><h2 class="c8" id="h.w92g0lchn3zm"><span class="c15 c16">CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY NOTICE</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion.
