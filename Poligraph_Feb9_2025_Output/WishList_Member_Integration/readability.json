At WishList Member we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>We don\u2019t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can\u2019t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We don\u2019t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We don\u2019t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WishList Products, LLC (\u201cWishList Member\u201d dba WishList Member) operates several websites including wishlistmember.com. It is WishList Member\u2019s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Website Visitors</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most website operators, WishList Member collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. WishList Member's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how WishList Member\u2019 visitors use its website. From time to time, WishList Member may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WishList Member also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. WishList Member only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain visitors to WishList Member websites choose to interact with WishList Member in ways that require WishList Member to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that WishList Member gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email address. Those who wish to receive WishList Member updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, WishList Member collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor\u2019s interaction with WishList Member. WishList Member does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WishList Member may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, WishList Member may monitor the most popular pages on the wishlistmember.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. WishList Member may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, WishList Member does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WishList Member discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on WishList Member's behalf or to provide services available at WishList Member's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using WishList Member's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. WishList Member will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, WishList Member discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when WishList Member believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of WishList Member, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a WishList Member website and have supplied your email address, WishList Member may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what\u2019s going on with WishList Member and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. WishList Member takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. WishList Member uses cookies to help WishList Member identify and track visitors, their usage of WishList Member websites, and their website access preferences. Visitors of WishList Member websites who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using WishList Member's websites, with the drawback that certain features of WishList Member's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If WishList Member, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that WishList Member goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of WishList Member may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ads</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by WishList Member and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments and other content submitted to Akismet anti-spam service are saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, WishList Member may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in WishList Member's sole discretion. WishList Member encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n</article>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div><!-- #content-wrap -->\n\n\t\n\n</main><!-- #main -->\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n</div></div>", "textContent": "\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\nYour privacy is very important to us.
