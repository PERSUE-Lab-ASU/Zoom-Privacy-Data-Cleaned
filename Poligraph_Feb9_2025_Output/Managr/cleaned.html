Third party companies that manage and deliver advertisements to websites and applications are commonly referred to as “network advertisers.” A permitted network advertiser may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with the Services or to tailor certain advertisements and content delivered within the Managr Services or on other websites within such network advertiser’s ad network. These companies may also use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web activity including your activities on or off of the Managr Services. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques.

We work with trusted third-party data processors, such as AWS and OpenAI, to facilitate certain aspects of our Services. OpenAI's API, in particular, assists us in generating content. It's important to note that OpenAI doesn't use the data we submit via their API to train or improve their models. You can read more about this here. We ensure that all our data processors adhere to high standards of data protection, are bound by contractual obligations to maintain the confidentiality of your data, and can only process data based on our specific instructions.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.388s;">Enterprise Accounts: Your employer or your organization may offer you access to our Services. We will share Personal Data with your employer or organization. Your employer or organization can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.392s;">For External Processing: We provide Personal Data to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or partners to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties include payment processors, such as financial institutions and their vendors and contractors that process transactions, marketing partners, and similar partners. It is our policy to only share Personal Data with contractors, service providers, technology partners, and other third parties who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Data confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them. Under certain circumstances, you may avoid having us share your information with our business partners and vendors by not granting us permission to share your information. Not granting us permission to share your information with our business partners or vendors may limit your access to their services through the Sites.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.396s;">For Legal Reasons. We will share Personal Data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Managr if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.4s;">meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.404s;">enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.408s;">detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.412s;">protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Managr, our Users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.416s;">We attempt to notify Users about legal demands for their Personal Data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.42s;">Business Transfers. If we establish a new related entity, are acquired by or merged with another organization, or if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another organization, Personal Data about our Users is often a transferred business asset. In the event that Managr itself or substantially all of our assets are acquired, Personal Data about our Users may be one of the transferred assets.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.424s;">Non-Personal and Aggregate Site Use Information. Managr may compile and share your information in aggregated form (i.e., in a manner that would not personally identify you) or in de-identified form so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual (“De-Identified Information”). We may disclose such De-Identified Information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, or to Managr Partners under agreement with us. Managr may also disclose De-Identified Information for general research purposes and in research collaborations with third parties, such as universities, hospitals or other laboratories to determine the prevalence of particular conditions among Users or to determine whether a User might be suitable for research or clinical trials. Managr may also use De-Identified Information for commercial collaborations with private companies for purposes such as product design or enhancement of Services.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.428s;">We disclose your Personal Information for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties:</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.432s;">Our affiliates;</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.436s;">Third parties to whom you or your agents authorize us to disclose your Personal Information in connection with the Services we provide to you.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.44s;">Service providers and other third parties we use to support our business, including without limitation those performing core services (such as credit card processing, customer support services, customer relationship management, property management, accounting, auditing, processing insurance claims, administering sweepstakes, surveys, advertising and marketing, analytics, email and mailing services, data storage, and security) related to the operation of our business and/or the Services.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.444s;">Commercial providers;</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.448s;">Enterprise accounts, such as your employer.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.452s;">Your Failure to Provide Personal Data</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.456s;">Your provision of Personal Data is required in order to use certain parts of our services and our programs.

For example, we keep your Personal Data for no longer than reasonably necessary for your use of our programs and Services and for a reasonable period of time afterward. We also may retain your Personal Data during the period of time needed for us to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.468s;">We retain your Personal Data even after your business relationship with us ends if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our Terms of Service, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.472s;">Your California Privacy Rights</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.476s;">California residents are entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Managr does not disclose personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. California users may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing us at the address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.48s;">Third Party Links</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.484s;">The Sites may contain links to webpages operated by parties other than Managr. We do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites. Our inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to the User to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the User selects or software the User downloads (whether from this Site or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the User will be subject to upon linking to the third party’s website. Managr strongly recommends that each User review the third party’s terms and policies.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.488s;">Use of YouTube API Services</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.492s;">Our Services use YouTube API Services to provide video-related functionalities.

Additionally, we encourage Users to review and understand Google’s Privacy Policy, as it governs YouTube’s handling of personal data. We do not store, access, or share YouTube user data except as permitted by YouTube’s API policies.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.496s;">International Transfer</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.5s;">We may, directly or indirectly through third-party entities around the world, process, store, and transfer the information you provide, including your Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy. Specifically, the information and Personal Information that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a location outside of your jurisdiction. It may also be processed by staff operating outside of your jurisdiction who work for us or for one of the organizations outlined in this Privacy Policy in connection with the activities outlined in this Privacy Policy. By submitting your information and Personal Information using the Sites, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We have put in place commercially reasonable technical and organizational procedures to safeguard the information and Personal Information we collect on the Sites.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.504s;">How We Protect Personal Data</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.508s;">Managr maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the User’s Personal Data and information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, the scope, context and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms. For example, we restrict access to personal information to Managr employees, contractors, business partners and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We use commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and Secure Socket Layer software (SSL) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Data.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.512s;">If Managr collects account information for payment or credit, Managr will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.516s;">Children</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.52s;">The Site is not intended for use by children. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 16. If a child has provided us with Personal Data, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us to have the information deleted from our records. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under the ages of 16, please contact us at admin@mymanagr.com. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the personal information of a child under the minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.524s;">Direct Marketing and “Do Not Track” Signals</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.528s;">Managr does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may include controls to block and delete cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to allow you to opt out of data collection through those technologies.</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.532s;">Changes to this Privacy Policy</p><p class="preFade" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 1s; transition-delay: 0.536s;">Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
