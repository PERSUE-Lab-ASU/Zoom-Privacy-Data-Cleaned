By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p><h3>Security Policy</h3><ol role="list"><li><strong>Purpose, Scope, and Organization </strong>What is this document, why does it exist, what does it cover, and who is in charge of it?</li></ol><p>‍</p><p>This policy outlines the behavioral, process, technical, and governance controls related to security at Flozy that all personnel must implement to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Flozy service and data ("Policy"). All personnel are required to be familiar with and adhere to the guidelines and procedures described below.This Policy specifies security requirements for:</p><ul role="list"><li>All Flozy employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties providing services to Flozy ("personnel"),</li><li>Management of systems, both hardware and software, regardless of location, that are used to create, maintain, store, access, process, or transmit information on behalf of Flozy. This includes systems owned by Flozy, systems connected to any network controlled by Flozy, or those used in the service of Flozy’s business, including third-party service providers,</li><li>Circumstances where Flozy has a legal, contractual, or fiduciary duty to protect data or resources in its custody.</li></ul><p>In cases of conflict, the more restrictive measures apply.</p><p>1.1. <strong>Governance and Evolution</strong> This Policy was developed in close collaboration with and approved by Flozy executives. It is reviewed and updated annually to ensure it remains clear, covers all necessary areas, protects customer and personnel interests, and aligns with the evolving security landscape and industry best practices.</p><p>1.2. <strong>Security Team </strong>The Flozy security team is responsible for implementing this Policy, including:</p><ul role="list"><li>Procurement, provisioning, maintenance, retirement, and reclamation of corporate computing resources,</li><li>All aspects of service development and operation concerning security, privacy, access, reliability, and survivability,</li><li>Ongoing risk assessment, vulnerability management, incident response,</li><li>Security-related human resources controls and personnel training.</li></ul><p>1.3. <strong>Risk Management Framework</strong> The security team maintains a Risk Management Framework based on NIST SP 800-39 - "Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and System View" and NIST SP 800-30 - "Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments". These assessments help prioritize improvements to Flozy's security posture, which may include updates to this Policy itself.The Risk Management Framework includes:</p><ul role="list"><li>Identification of relevant, potential threats,</li><li>A scheme for assessing the strength of implemented controls,</li><li>A scheme for assessing current risks and evaluating their severity,</li><li>A scheme for responding to risks.</li></ul><ol role="list" start="2"><li><strong>Personnel and Office Environment </strong>What are Flozy’s expectations of its personnel and the workplace regarding systems and data?</li></ol><p>‍</p><p>Flozy is dedicated to protecting its customers, personnel, partners, and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly, within its established employment culture of openness, trust, maturity, and integrity.This section outlines expected personnel behaviors affecting security and the acceptable use of computer systems at Flozy. These rules are in place to protect both personnel and Flozy itself, as inappropriate use may expose customers and partners to risks such as malware, viruses, compromise of networked systems and services, and legal issues.</p><p>2.1. <strong>Work Behaviors </strong>The first line of defense in data security is the informed behavior of personnel, who play a significant role in ensuring the security of all data, regardless of format. Such behaviors include those listed in this section as well as any additional requirements specified in the employee handbook, specific security processes, and other applicable codes of conduct.</p><p>‍<strong>Training </strong>All employees and contractors must complete the Flozy security awareness and data handling training programs at least annually.</p><p>‍<strong>Unrecognized Persons and Visitors </strong>It is the responsibility of all personnel to maintain physical security. Challenge any unrecognized person present in a restricted office location. Any challenged person who does not respond appropriately should be immediately reported to supervisory staff and the security team. All visitors to Flozy offices must be registered or accompanied by a Flozy employee.</p><p>‍<strong>Clean Desk </strong>Personnel should keep workspaces clear of sensitive or confidential material and ensure such materials are secured at the end of each workday.</p><p>‍<strong>Unattended Devices </strong>Unattended devices must be locked. All devices will have an automatic screen lock function set to activate after no more than fifteen minutes of inactivity.</p><p>‍<strong>Use of Corporate Assets </strong>Systems are to be used for business purposes to serve the interests of the company, and of our clients and partners in the course of normal business operations. Personnel are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use of systems. Only Flozy-managed hardware and software is permitted to be connected to or installed on corporate equipment or networks and used to access Flozy data. Flozy-managed hardware and software include those either owned by Flozy or owned by Flozy personnel but enrolled in a Flozy device management system. Only software approved for corporate use by Flozy may be installed on corporate equipment. All personnel must read and understand the list of prohibited activities outlined in this Policy. Modifications or configuration changes are not permitted without explicit written consent by the Flozy security team.</p><p>‍<strong>Removable Storage, No Backups, Use of Cloud Storage </strong>Use of removable media such as USB drives is prohibited. Personnel may not configure work devices to make backups or copies of data outside corporate policies. Instead, personnel are expected to operate primarily "in the cloud" and treat local storage on computing devices as ephemeral. Flozy data must be saved to company-approved secure cloud storage (e.g., Google Docs) to ensure that even in the event of a corporate device being lost, stolen, or damaged, such artifacts will be immediately recoverable on a replacement device.</p><p><strong>Prohibited Activities </strong>The following activities are prohibited. Under certain conditions and with the explicit written consent of the security team, personnel may be exempted from certain of these restrictions during the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g., planned penetration testing, systems administration staff may have a need to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting production services).The list below is by no means exhaustive, but attempts to provide a framework for activities which fall into the category of unacceptable use.</p><ul role="list"><li>Under no circumstances are personnel of Flozy authorized to engage in any activity that is illegal under local, state, federal, or international law while utilizing Flozy-owned resources.</li><li>Violations of the rights of any person or company protected by copyright, trade secret, patent, or other intellectual property, or similar laws or regulations including, but not limited to, the installation or distribution of "pirated" or other software products that are not appropriately licensed for use by Flozy.</li><li>Violating or attempting to violate the terms of use or license agreement of any software product used by Flozy is strictly prohibited.</li><li>Unauthorized copying of copyrighted material including, but not limited to, digitization and distribution of photographs from magazines, books, or other copyrighted sources, copyrighted music, and the installation of any copyrighted software for which Flozy or the end user does not have an active license is strictly prohibited.</li><li>Exporting software, technical information, encryption software, or technology may result in a violation of international or regional export control laws. The appropriate management should be consulted prior to export of any material that is in question.</li><li>Revealing your account password to others or allowing use of your account by others. This includes colleagues, as well as family and other household members when work is being done at home.</li><li>Making fraudulent offers of products, items, or services originating from any Flozy account.</li><li>Making statements about warranty, expressly or implied, unless it is a part of normal job duties and then only to the extent the warranties are consistent with Flozy’s authorized warranties.</li><li>Introduction of malicious programs into the network or server (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses, e-mail bombs, etc.).</li><li>Effecting security breaches or disruptions of network communication. Security breaches include, but are not limited to, accessing data of which the employee is not an intended recipient or logging into a server or account that the employee is not expressly authorized to access. For purposes of this section, "disruption" includes, but is not limited to, network sniffing, ping floods, packet spoofing, denial of service, and forged routing information for malicious or unlawful purposes.</li><li>Except by or under the direct supervision of the security team, port scanning or security scanning, or other such software designed to exploit or find computer, software, or network vulnerabilities.</li><li>Executing any form of network monitoring which will intercept data not intended for the employee’s host, unless this activity is a part of the employee’s normal job/duty.</li><li>Circumventing user authentication or security of any host, network, or account or attempting to break into an information resource or to bypass a security feature. This includes running password-cracking programs or sniffer programs, and attempting to circumvent file or other resource permissions.</li><li>Attempting to interfere with or deny service to any other user.</li><li>Providing information about, or lists of, Flozy personnel to parties outside Flozy.</li><li>Installation of software which installs or includes any form of malware, spyware, or adware as defined by the security team.</li><li>Crashing an information system. Deliberately crashing an information system is strictly prohibited. Users may not realize that they caused a system crash, but if it is shown that the crash occurred as a result of user action, a repetition of the action by that user may be viewed as a deliberate act.</li><li>Attempts to subvert technologies used to effect system configuration of company-managed devices (e.g., MDM) or personal devices voluntarily used for company purposes (e.g., mobile Work Profiles).</li></ul><p>2.2. <strong>Personnel Systems Configuration, Ownership, and Privacy Centralized System Configuration </strong>Personnel devices and their software configuration are managed remotely by members of the security team via configuration-enforcement technology, also known as MDM software. Such technology may be used for purposes including auditing/installing/removing software applications or system services, managing network configuration, enforcing password policy, encrypting disks, remote wipe &amp; recovery, copying data files to/from employee devices, and any other allowed interaction to ensure that employee devices comply with this Policy. </p><p>‍<strong>Data and Device Encryption </strong>All devices must use modern full disk encryption to protect data in the event of a lost device. An example of valid full disk encryption is Apple FileVault 2 using XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key. This is enforced using MDM software.</p><p>‍<strong>Device Heartbeat and Remote Wipe </strong>Devices must support the ability to report their status and be remotely wiped. This is enforced using MDM software.</p><p>‍<strong>Prevent Removable Storage </strong>Devices must prevent usage of removable storage. This is enforced using MDM software.<strong>Endpoint/Antivirus/Antimalware Protection</strong>Devices must automatically install and configure the Flozy provided antivirus software for endpoint protection. Configured software will report status and potential threats, allowing for remote administration and reporting by the security team. This is enforced using MDM software.</p><p>‍<strong>Retention of Ownership </strong>All software programs, data, and documentation generated or provided by personnel while providing services to Flozy or for the benefit of Flozy are the property of Flozy unless otherwise covered by a contractual agreement. </p><p>‍<strong>Personnel Privacy </strong>While Flozy’s network administration desires to provide a reasonable level of privacy, users should be aware that the data they create on the corporate systems remains the property of Flozy. Due to the need to protect Flozy’s network, management does not intend to guarantee the privacy of personnel’s personal information stored on any network device belonging to Flozy. Personnel are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use such as general web browsing or personal email. If there is any uncertainty, personnel should consult the security team or their manager.Personnel should structure all electronic communication with recognition of the fact that the content could be monitored and that any electronic communication could be forwarded, intercepted, printed, or stored by others.Flozy reserves the right, at its discretion, to review personnel’s files or electronic communications to the extent necessary to ensure all electronic media and services are used in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations as well as corporate policies.Flozy reserves the right to audit networks and systems on a periodic basis to ensure compliance with this policy. For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within Flozy may monitor equipment, systems, and network traffic at any time.</p><p>2.3. <strong>Human Resources PracticesBackground Checks </strong>Background checks are conducted for personnel with access to production infrastructure prior to their start date. The consequences of problematic background check results may range from a limitation of security privileges, to revocation of employment offer, to termination.</p><p>‍<strong>Training </strong>The security team maintains a company-wide security awareness program delivered to all personnel at least annually. The program covers security awareness, policies, processes, and training to ensure that personnel are sufficiently informed to meet their obligations. Those most responsible for maintaining security at Flozy, including the security team itself as well as key engineering/operations staff, undergo more technical continuing education.</p><p>‍<strong>Separation </strong>In the case of personnel termination or resignation, the security team coordinates with human resources to implement a standardized separation process to ensure that all accounts, credentials, and access of outgoing employees are reliably disabled.</p><p>2.4. <strong>Physical Office Environment </strong>Access to Flozy offices is mediated by a staffed front office and programmable door control access. All doors shall remain locked or staffed under normal business conditions. The security team may provide approval to unlock doors for short periods of time in order to accommodate extenuating physical access needs.Internet-based security cameras are positioned to record time-stamped video of ingress/egress, which are stored off-site.</p><p>2.5. <strong>Office Network </strong>Internet access shall be provided to devices via wired ethernet and WPA2 wifi. Networking switches and routers shall be placed in a locked networking closet with only the security team having access. Flozy executives and the security team may grant access to the networking closet to individuals on a case-by-case and as-needed basis. A network firewall that blocks all WAN-sourced traffic shall be put in place. WAN-accessible network services shall not be hosted within the office environment.</p><ol role="list" start="3"><li><strong>Personnel Identity and Access Management </strong>How does Flozy define, control, and maintain user identity and permissions for personnel?</li></ol><p>‍</p><p>3.1. <strong>User Accounts and Authentication </strong>Each individual having access to any Flozy-controlled system does so via a G Suite user account denoting their system identity. Such user accounts are required to have a unique username, a unique strong password of at least 8 characters, and a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism.</p><p>‍<strong>Logging into Flozy Systems </strong>Logins by personnel may originate only from Flozy-managed devices. Authentication is performed by Google’s account management system, details of which can be found at <a target="_new" href="https://gsuite.google.com/security">https://gsuite.google.com/security</a>. Flozy leverages G Suite’s facilities of detecting malicious authentication attempts. Repeated failed attempts to authenticate may result in the offending user account being locked or revoked.</p><p>‍<strong>Logging into Third Party Systems </strong>Whenever available, third-party systems must be configured to delegate authentication to Flozy’s G Suite account authentication system (described above) thereby consolidating authentication controls into a single user account system that is centrally managed by the security team.When authentication to G Suite is not available, unique strong passwords must be created and stored in the Flozy approved password management system. Passwords must be paired with two-factor/MFA authentication.</p><p>‍<strong>Revocation and Auditing of User Accounts </strong>User accounts are revoked (that is, disabled but not deleted) immediately upon personnel separation. As a further precaution, all user accounts are audited at least quarterly, and any inactive user accounts are revoked.</p><p>3.2. <strong>Access Management </strong>Flozy adheres to the principle of least privilege, and every action attempted by a user account is subject to access control checks.</p><p><strong>Role-based Access Control </strong>Flozy employs a role-based access control (RBAC) model utilizing Google-supplied facilities such as organizational units, user accounts, user groups, and sharing controls.</p><p><strong>Web Browsers and Extensions </strong>Flozy may require use of a specified web browser(s) for normal business use and for access to corporate data such as email. For certain specified roles such as software development and web design, job activities beyond those mentioned above necessitate the use of a variety of browsers, and these roles may do so as needed for those activities.</p><p>Any browser that is allowed to access corporate data such as email is subject to a whitelist-based restriction on which browser extensions can be installed.</p><p><strong>Administrative Access </strong>Access to administrative operations is strictly limited to security team members and further restricted still as a function of tenure and the principle of least privilege.</p><p><strong>Regular Review </strong>Access control policies are reviewed regularly with the goal of reducing or refining access whenever possible. Changes in job function by personnel trigger an access review as well.</p><p>3.3. <strong>Termination </strong>Upon termination of personnel, whether voluntary or involuntary, the security team will follow Flozy’s personnel exit procedure, which includes revocation of the associated user account and reclamation of company-owned devices, office keys or access cards, and all other corporate equipment and property prior to the final day of employment.</p><ol role="list" start="4"><li><strong>Provenance of Technology </strong>How does Flozy build, adopt, configure, and maintain technology to fulfill its security intentions?</li></ol><p>‍</p><p>4.1. <strong>Software Development </strong>Flozy stores source code and configuration files in private GitHub repositories. The security and development teams conduct code reviews and execute a static code analysis tool on every code commit. Reviewers shall check for compliance with Flozy’s conventions and style, potential bugs, potential performance issues, and that the commit is bound to only its intended purpose.</p><p>Security reviews shall be conducted on every code commit to security-sensitive modules. Such modules include those that pertain directly to authentication, authorization, access control, auditing, and encryption.</p><p>All major pieces of incorporated open source software libraries and tools shall be reviewed for robustness, stability, performance, security, and maintainability.</p><p>The security and development teams shall establish and adhere to a formal software release process.</p><p>Sensitive data which does not need to be decrypted (e.g. passwords) is salted and hashed using approved functions such as Bcrypt.</p><p>Sensitive data which must be decrypted (e.g. tokens) must use an approved encryption provider for HSM functions, such as KMS.</p><p>4.2. <strong>Configuration and Change Management </strong>The Flozy security and development teams shall document the configuration of all adopted systems and services, whether hosted by Flozy or are third party hosted. Industry best practices and vendor-specific guidance shall be identified and incorporated into system configurations. All configurations shall be reviewed on at least an annual basis. Any changes to configurations must be approved by appointed individuals and documented in a timely fashion.</p><p>System configurations must address the following controls in a risk-based fashion and in accordance with the remainder of this policy:</p><ul role="list"><li>data-at-rest protection encryption</li><li>data-in-transit protection of confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity for incoming and outgoing data</li><li>data and file integrity</li><li>malware detection and resolution</li><li>capturing event logs</li><li>authentication of administrative users</li><li>access control enforcement</li><li>removal or disabling of unnecessary software and configurations</li><li>allocation of sufficient hardware resources to support loads that are expected at least twelve months into the future.</li><li>production data is not used in development or test systems.</li></ul><p>4.3. <strong>Third Party Services </strong>For every third-party service or sub-processor that Flozy adopts, the compliance team shall review the service and vendor, on an annual basis, to gain assurance that their security posture is consistent with Flozy’s for the type and sensitivity of data the service will store or access.</p><p>Flozy relies on Amazon Web Services to satisfy specific security controls related to the AWS data centers and AWS services. For more information on Physical and Environmental Security, as well as the Logical Access and Security controls for AWS services, please see the AWS Security White Paper: <a target="_new" href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-security-whitepaper.pdf">https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-security-whitepaper.pdf</a></p><ol role="list" start="5"><li><strong>Data Classification and Processing </strong>How does Flozy manage data classifications and data processing?</li></ol><p>‍</p><p>5.1. <strong>Data Classification </strong>Flozy maintains the following Data Confidentiality Levels:</p><ul role="list"><li>Confidential - Information only available to specific roles within the organization. Data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access to data requires 2FA/MFA.</li><li>Restricted - Access restricted to specific roles within the organization and authorized third parties. Data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access to data requires 2FA/MFA.</li><li>Internal - Information is available to all employees and authorized third parties.
