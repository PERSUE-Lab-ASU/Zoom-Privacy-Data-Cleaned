            <p>We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Website. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources.</p>

            <p>In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Website. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date, and time.</p>

            <p>AOKYourself is not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13.

          <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-lg-8">
            <p>AOKYourself collects the following information, either directly from AOKYourself Users, Invitees, or Viewers, or through third-parties regarding Users, Invitees, or Viewers.</p>

            <p>Appointment Information.</p>
            <p>A AOKYourself User, Invitee, or a third-party may voluntarily give us certain information. This can include names, email addresses, and phone numbers; email addresses of other people; the subject of the meeting; and any other information provided to us or as required by the AOKYourself User upon scheduling, pursuant to the AOKYourself Terms of Use. If you receive an invitation from a AOKYourself User but do not wish to become a AOKYourself User, please contact the AOKYourself User who sent the invitation through other means to set up your meeting.</p>

            <p>Calendar Information.</p>
            <p>A AOKYourself User may connect their calendar with AOKYourself. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when you’re busy. We never store who you are meeting with, their email address, the meeting title, or any other details about the appointments in your connected calendar.</p>

            <p>Billing Information.</p>
            <p>If you purchase a premium version of AOKYourself, our third-party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, card type, and the expiration date.</p>

Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Website, improve your experience, and tailor marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</p>

            <p>Log &amp; Device data.</p>
            <p>When you use AOKYourself, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website.

To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>

            <p>Cookie data.</p>

            <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

            <p>The request must:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Provide sufficiently detailed information to allow AOKYourself to reasonably verify that you are the person to whom the requested Personal Information pertains or their authorized representative.</li>

            <p>We will attempt to respond to California Resident requests in as timely a fashion as possible.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable receipt of a California Resident’s request. The response we provide will explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</p>

            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before fulfilling your request.</p>
