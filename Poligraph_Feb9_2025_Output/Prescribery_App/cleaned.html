<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Last Modified</em>: 4/14/2021</p>
<p>Prescribery Administration, Inc. (“Prescribery” or “Company”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the Platforms and Services. This policy provides you with information about how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information. The Company has published this “Privacy Policy” to show its commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Section 1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>1.1. <strong><em>Scope.</em></strong> This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Service, and not to any websites or services of third parties (“Third Party Websites”), which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. For additional information, see Section 13 (Third Party Websites) and Section 3.3 (Information from Third-Party Sources).</p>
<p>1.2. <strong><em>Separate Terms of Use.</em></strong> By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have also read and understood, and agree to be bound by, both this Privacy and the Company’s separate Terms of Service document (the “Terms of Service”), which is incorporated by reference and made part of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>1.3. <strong><em>HIPAA Authorization.</em></strong> This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Platforms. Should you choose to apply for and/or enlist the telehealth services of the Company, you will be required to complete Patient Forms that include a so-called “HIPAA Authorization” regarding the use and/or disclosure of your medical information. The terms of the HIPPA Authorization are provided on your Patient Forms and in Section 17 below.</p>
<p>1.4. <strong><em>No Permission Without Agreement.</em></strong> <strong>By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have read and understood, and agree to the terms of, this Privacy Policy. If you do not understand or do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using or accessing the Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 2.</strong> <strong>Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Each time you access the Service, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Although most changes are likely to be minor, the Company reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, update, change, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting a new version on this page. Any such addition, update, or change will be effective immediately on posting. Unless the Company obtains your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3. How We Collect Data</strong></p>
<p>Like most website and mobile application operators, the Company collects information about you in three ways: (1) information you provide to us; (2) information we collect through automatic data collection technologies, including (a) IP addresses; (b) Internet domain names; (c) types of devices accessing the Service; and (d) types of Web browsers accessing the Service (collectively “Traffic Data”).

In each case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Services will not gather it secretly. The Company may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide that information to the Company.

<p><strong>Section 11. Children’s Privacy </strong></p>
<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, “COPPA”) require us to inform parents and legal guardians (“parents”) about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13 (“children”). It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child’s parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information.</p>
<p>11.1. <strong><em>Company’s Controls. </em></strong>We may ask you to provide age-related information. For example, we may request your date of birth to determine whether COPPA requires us to obtain verifiable parental consent from your parents before allowing you access to our Services. If you indicate that you are under the age of 13, we will require that a parental approval process be completed before continuing to access our Services. This process is designed to notify parents that their child has requested access to our Services, inform them about our privacy practices, offer them the opportunity to approve our collection and use of their child’s information as described in this section, and describe the controls that we make available to them.</p>
<p>11.2. <strong><em>Information We Collect from Children. </em></strong>Children can access certain parts of the of the Website and its content without providing us with personal information. However, some content, features, and Services require collection of certain information. We only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in the Services, and we do not condition his or her participation on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary. Refer to Section 1 of the Privacy Policy to see the information we collect.</p>
<p>11.3. <strong><em>How We Use Your Child’s Information. </em></strong>Refer to Section 2 of the Privacy Policy to see how we use the information we collect.</p>
<p>11.4. <strong><em>Our Practices for Disclosing Children’s Information. </em></strong>We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer children’s personal information other than as described in Section 3 of the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>11.5. <strong><em>Accessing and Correcting Your Child’s Personal Information. </em></strong>At any time, you may review the child’s personal information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete the personal information, and refuse to permit us from further collecting or using the child’s information. You can review, change, or delete your child’s personal information by logging into your child’s account and visiting his or her account profile page.</p>
<p><strong>Section 12. Your California Privacy Rights. </strong></p>
<p>If you are a California resident, California law, including under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information.</p>

<p>We obtain the categories of personal information listed above as referenced in Section 2.</p>
<p>12.2. <strong><em>Use of Personal Information. </em></strong>Refer to Section 3 of the Privacy Policy to see how we use the information we collect.</p>
<p>12.3. <strong><em>Sharing Personal Information. </em></strong>Refer to Section 4 of the Privacy Policy to see how we use your information.</p>
<p>12.4. <strong><em>Your Rights and Choices. </em></strong>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
<p>12.4.1. <em>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights. </em>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
<p>12.4.1.a. The categories of personal information we collected about you;</p>
<p>12.4.1.b. The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you;</p>
<p>12.4.1.c. Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information;</p>
<p>12.4.1.d. The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information;</p>
<p>12.4.1.e. The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you; and</p>
<p>12.4.1.f. If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:</p>
<p>12.4.1.f.1. Sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</p>
<p>12.4.1.f.2. Disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</p>
<p>12.4.2. <em>Deletion Request Rights. </em>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collect from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us to:</p>
<p>12.4.2.a. Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide Services that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;</p>
<p>12.4.2.b. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;</p>
<p>12.4.2.c. Debug Services to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;</p>
<p>12.4.2.d. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;</p>
<p>12.4.2.e. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code §154 et. seq.);</p>
<p>12.4.2.f. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;</p>
<p>12.4.2.g. Comply with a legal obligation; and</p>
<p>12.4.2.h. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</p>
<p>12.4.3. <em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights. </em>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described in Section 8.4.1. and Section 8.4.2., please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by contacting us using the “Contact Us” link through the Website. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<p>12.4.3.a. Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and</p>
<p>12.4.3.b. Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>12.4.4. <em>Response Timing and Format. </em>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and the extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response electronically via email. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p>12.4.5. <em>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights. </em>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parents of a user less than 13 years of age. Users who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by contacting us using the “Contact Us” link through the Website with the subject line “Do Not Sell My Personal Information.” Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into personal information sales at any time by contacting us using the “Contact Us” link through the Website. You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
<p>12.5. <strong><em>Non-Discrimination. </em></strong>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
<p>12.5.1. Deny you Services;</p>
<p>12.5.2. Charge you different prices or rates for Services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;</p>
<p>12.5.3. Provide you a different level or quality of Services; or</p>
<p>12.5.4. Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for Services or a different level or quality of Services.</p>
<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that <strong>can result</strong> in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Section 13. Third Party Websites. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Company neither owns nor controls Third Party Websites. Accordingly,</strong> Third Party Websites are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy except with respect to Personal Information provided directly to them by the Company. Before visiting or providing Personal Information to Third Party Websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of those Third-Party Websites, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect your privacy.</p>
<p><strong> Section 14. Promotional Activities.</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, the Company may conduct contests, giveaways, and other promotions (collectively, “Promotional Activities”). Any information submitted in connection with Promotional Activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, The Company may also ask you to participate in surveys designed to help the Company improve the Services. Any Personal Information provided to the Company in connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey, and will be disclosed to third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy only in aggregated form.</p>
<p><strong>Section 15. Business Transitions.</strong></p>
<p>In the event the Company goes through a business transition, including without limitation any merger, acquisition, partnership, business reorganization, debt finance, or sale of company assets, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership (together a “Business Transition”), the Company may use information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to its restrictions, as part of any such Business Transition. In such instances, your information can be part of the assets transferred.</p>
<p><strong>Section 16. How to Contact Us </strong></p>
<p>To ask questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy, or if you would like to exercise your rights to your Personal Information, you may contact us by emailing us at the “Contact Us” link through the Website.</p>
<p><strong>Section 17.</strong> <strong>HIPPA Consent Form &amp; Disclosure Authorization. </strong>You understand and agree that the following terms and authorization apply to any Health Information submitted or transferred by you to the Company as part of any Patient Form, communication, or if you otherwise choose to apply for and/or enlist the telehealth services of the Company.</p>
<p>17.1. You understand that you have certain rights to privacy regarding your protected Health Information. These rights are given to you under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”).</p>

<p>17.3. You understand and acknowledge that your authorization herein may cover disclosure and use of, among other things, Health Information related to mental healthcare, communicable diseases (including HIV or AIDS), and the treatment of alcohol or drug abuse.</p>
<p>17.4. You acknowledge that you have been informed of and given the right to review and secure a copy of this Privacy Policy and the Company’s Statement of Privacy Practices, which contains a full description of the uses and disclosures of your protected Health Information and your rights under HIPPA.</p>

You understand and agree that the Company reserves the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy and its Statement of Privacy Practices from time to time and you may visit this webpage or contact Doctalkgo.com at any time to obtain the most current copy of this Privacy Policy and its Statement of Privacy Practices.</p>
<p>17.6. You understand that you have the right to request restrictions on how your protected Health Information is used and disclosed to carry out Treatment, Obtaining Payment, and Healthcare Operations, but that the Company is not required to agree to these requested restrictions. However, if the Company does agree, then it is bound to comply with the requested restrictions.</p>
<p>17.7. You understand that you may revoke this HIPAA Authorization in writing, at any time; however, any disclosure or use that occurred prior to the date of said revocation is not affected thereby.</p>
