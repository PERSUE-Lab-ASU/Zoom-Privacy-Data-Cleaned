Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>\n<p>12.4.3.a. Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and</p>\n<p>12.4.3.b. Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>\n<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response electronically via email. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request\u2019s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>\n<p>12.4.5. <em>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights. </em>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the \u201cright to opt-out\u201d). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the \u201cright to opt-in\u201d) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parents of a user less than 13 years of age. Users who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
