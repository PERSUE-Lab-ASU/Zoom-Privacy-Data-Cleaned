Information About Cookies. A cookie is a text file stored on your computer. Cookies store bits of information that we use to help make our site work. They can’t run any code and don’t contain viruses. No one can read our cookies except us.</p><p><strong>How We Use Cookies.</strong> Ava uses cookies to improve your experience on this site; some are essential to the proper function of this site. We also use cookies to help us understand how people use our site and to serve Ava ads when you visit other sites.</p><p><strong>Types of Cookies We Use</strong> · Security Cookies: These cookies allow us to secure access to your account · Preference Cookies: These cookies are used to store your preferences like language choice. · Analytics: Ava may use a variety of technologies that passively or automatically collect information about how the Services are accessed and used, including your browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the pages served to you, the time you browse, preceding page views, and your use of particular features of the Services. This statistical data helps us understand potential site problems and what is interesting and relevant to users of the Services so that we can best tailor our content to you. · Advertising Cookies: We use non-identifiable information about you to show you advertising on our site · Widgets: to help you to share information on third party social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and Youtube. These widgets use Cookies that track you when you navigate the Internet. · Device Identifiers: Ava also automatically collects an IP address or other unique identifier for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively “Device”) you use to access the Services. A “Device Identifier” is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Services, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, monitor against theft and fraud, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. If you access the Services on a mobile Device, we may request access to settings and location information for similar purposes and to personalize your experience with the Services. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services or push notifications. Please note that if you choose not to provide us with your location information, you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services. · Session Trackers: In operating the Services, we may use session tracking technologies (“Session Trackers”). Session trackers help provide additional functionality to the Services, customize users’ experiences with the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately for research and product development purposes. We (including third parties that we work with) may place session trackers on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate navigation of the Services, and to personalize your experience while using our Services. If you would prefer not to accept Session Trackers when using the Services, follow the instructions provided by your website or mobile browser (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility) to modify your Session Tracker settings. Please note that if you disable Session Trackers, you may not be able to access certain parts of our Services and other parts of our Services may not work properly. As a result, we recommend that you leave Session Trackers turned on when accessing the Services because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services’ features. · Web Beacons: In addition to Session Trackers, we may use web beacons (also known as “clear GIFs”), which are transparent graphic images placed on a web page or in an email and indicate that a page or email has been viewed or tell your browser to get content from another server. We use web beacons to measure traffic to or from, or use of, our online forms, tools or content items and related browsing behavior and to improve your experience when using the Services. We may also use customized links or other similar technologies to track hyperlinks that you click and associate that information with your Personal Information in order to provide you with more focused communications. · Non-Personal Information: Additionally, we may modify and combine Personal Information in a manner that does not personally identify you or any other individual and thus, no longer constitutes “Personal Information”. We may use this non-Personal Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and usage information, for any lawful purpose.</p><p><strong>Your Choices Regarding Cookies.</strong> You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being set, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

The cookies and other information stored in your terminal will not be kept beyond 13 months after your last expression of consent. Personal Information collected through the cookies will not be kept beyond 13 months as from their collection.</p><h2>Children Under 18 and Under 13</h2><p>Ava is COPPA compliant.
