Introduction</h2><div><p>This brief summary of certain information in this Policy is intended to help you quickly understand what ZoomInfo is, how you can opt out of our database, and the potential outcomes of remaining in our database.</p>\n<p>ZoomInfo collects business contact and similar information related to individuals when they are working in their professional or employment capacity and uses this information to create professional profiles of individuals and profiles of businesses. We provide this information to our customers, who are businesses trying to reach business professionals for their own business-to-business sales, marketing, and recruiting activities.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of our database by visiting our <a href=\"https://www.zoominfo.com/privacy-center/manage-profile\">Privacy Center</a>.

How We Collect Information</h2><p><b>ZoomInfo collects data about people and companies through multiple channels, including the web, information provided by our users and customers, information licensed from other companies, and research from our in-house research team. Click on each dropdown below to learn more about how we collect information and the types of information we collect.</b></p><div><ul><li id=\"0\"><div><p>A. Where does ZoomInfo get the Business Information for its Professional and Business Profiles?</p></div><div><p>ZoomInfo creates profiles of companies (\u201c<b>Business Profiles</b>\u201d) and individuals in their professional capacity (\u201c<b>Professional Profiles</b>\u201d). Once we have collected Business Information about a person or company, we may combine multiple data points regarding a single person or company into a Professional or Business Profile. The resulting directory of Professional and Business Profiles (the \u201c<b>Directory</b>\u201d) is then made available to the users of the Site, our customers, and our partners. Business Information that may be provided in a Professional Profile includes name, email address (including business and/or other email addresses, such as \u201cfreemails\u201d like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.), job title and department, phone number (general or direct business numbers, faxes, and/or mobile numbers), company name, postal address of company and business-related postal address of the person, employment history, and education history. Professional Profiles may also include links to articles by, about, or quoting an individual, and links to an individual\u2019s social media profiles.</p>\n<p>ZoomInfo obtains the data for its Professional and Business Profiles in several ways, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our search technology scans the web and gathers publicly available information.</li>\n<li>We license information from other companies.</li>\n<li>Our users and customers contribute information about themselves or other people and companies.</li>\n<li>Through market research surveys, phone interviews, and other research conducted by our in-house research team.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ZoomInfo also makes certain limited Business Information from its Professional Profiles publicly available in our directory pages on our Site (the \u201c<b>Public Directory</b>\u201d). The categories of Business Information that may be made available in the Public Directory include, but are not limited to, past or current name, company, company headquarters telephone number, office address, job title, previous professional experience, professional memberships and affiliations, education information, and/or web links to articles recently written by or about the featured individual.</p>\n</div></li><li id=\"1\"><div><p>B. How does ZoomInfo Lite (formerly Community Edition) and the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor Work?</p></div><div><p>ZoomInfo offers a service called <b>ZoomInfo Lite</b> (formerly \u201cCommunity Edition\u201d). When subscribing to ZoomInfo Lite, a user may install software offered on the Site known as the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor (the \u201c<b>Software</b>\u201d) or otherwise provide ZoomInfo with access to the user\u2019s email account. If a user installs the Software or otherwise provides ZoomInfo access to an email account, the user allows ZoomInfo to access certain Business Information stored by the application that the user\u2019s computer uses to manage the user\u2019s email and contacts, known as an \u201cemail client\u201d (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) or stored by a provider of cloud services for email (e.g., Google). If required to access this Business Information stored on the user\u2019s computer\u2019s email and contact application(s), the user may need to provide ZoomInfo with the necessary username and password information. We use this Business Information to improve the size and quality of our Directory. In exchange for allowing this access, the user receives credits for use on ZoomInfo Lite at no charge under specified terms and conditions (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zoominfo.com/legal/ce-terms-conditions\">/legal/ce-terms-conditions</a>). A user may also access ZoomInfo Lite without providing ZoomInfo such information from their email by signing up with their email address instead of connecting their Google or Office 365 account directly. Such users will receive fewer monthly credits than a user contributing Business Information as described above.</p>\n<p>Information that may be collected from the user\u2019s email client includes the following, if available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Name</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Email address</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Job title and department</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Phone numbers (general or direct business numbers, faxes and/or mobile numbers)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Company name</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Postal address of company</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Business-related postal address of person</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Corporate website URLs</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Social media URLs</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Metadata such as Internet Protocol addresses, the dates email messages are sent or received, and subject line information</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Email addresses, names, and job titles of recipients and senders</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To ensure the integrity of the Directory, we take the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Business Information Only \u2013 Emails sent to ZoomInfo Lite users from consumer-oriented email services (or \u201cfreemails\u201d) such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo, are disregarded.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Unattributed \u2013 We do not disclose who contributed particular information using the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor software or other contribution methods, except as discussed below. (See \u201cDisclosures to Service Providers,\u201d \u201cDisclosures for Legal Reasons,\u201d and \u201cDisclosures to a Buyer of the Company\u201d)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Opt-Out \u2013 Anyone added to the Directory may request to be removed at any time, via email, web, our toll-free number, or by writing to us at the Contact Us address below. We will fulfill such requests as promptly as we can, and in any event within any time period that may be required by applicable law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ZoomInfo does not \u201cread\u201d the body of email messages; our technology automatically extracts only the data we describe in this Policy. We do not collect data from custom fields or notes in the email client.</p>\n<p>Information extracted may continue to be shared as described above as long as the Software remains installed or the user continues to allow ZoomInfo\u2019s access to the user\u2019s email account. To stop sharing information with ZoomInfo, a user can uninstall the Software at any time or disable ZoomInfo\u2019s access to the user\u2019s email account through the user\u2019s email account settings. Information that has previously been shared with ZoomInfo cannot be unshared by disabling the Software.</p>\n</div></li><li id=\"2\"><div><p>C.

Business Information that may be provided in a Professional Profile includes name, email address (including business and/or other email addresses, such as \u201cfreemails\u201d like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.), job title and department, phone number (general or direct business numbers, faxes, and/or mobile numbers), company name, postal address of company and business-related postal address of the person, employment history, and education history. Professional Profiles may also include links to articles by, about, or quoting an individual, and links to an individual\u2019s social media profiles.\nZoomInfo obtains the data for its Professional and Business Profiles in several ways, including:\n\nOur search technology scans the web and gathers publicly available information.\nWe license information from other companies.\nOur users and customers contribute information about themselves or other people and companies.\nThrough market research surveys, phone interviews, and other research conducted by our in-house research team.\n\nZoomInfo also makes certain limited Business Information from its Professional Profiles publicly available in our directory pages on our Site (the \u201cPublic Directory\u201d). The categories of Business Information that may be made available in the Public Directory include, but are not limited to, past or current name, company, company headquarters telephone number, office address, job title, previous professional experience, professional memberships and affiliations, education information, and/or web links to articles recently written by or about the featured individual.\nB. How does ZoomInfo Lite (formerly Community Edition) and the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor Work?ZoomInfo offers a service called ZoomInfo Lite (formerly \u201cCommunity Edition\u201d). When subscribing to ZoomInfo Lite, a user may install software offered on the Site known as the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor (the \u201cSoftware\u201d) or otherwise provide ZoomInfo with access to the user\u2019s email account. If a user installs the Software or otherwise provides ZoomInfo access to an email account, the user allows ZoomInfo to access certain Business Information stored by the application that the user\u2019s computer uses to manage the user\u2019s email and contacts, known as an \u201cemail client\u201d (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) or stored by a provider of cloud services for email (e.g., Google). If required to access this Business Information stored on the user\u2019s computer\u2019s email and contact application(s), the user may need to provide ZoomInfo with the necessary username and password information. We use this Business Information to improve the size and quality of our Directory. In exchange for allowing this access, the user receives credits for use on ZoomInfo Lite at no charge under specified terms and conditions (available at\u00a0/legal/ce-terms-conditions). A user may also access ZoomInfo Lite without providing ZoomInfo such information from their email by signing up with their email address instead of connecting their Google or Office 365 account directly. Such users will receive fewer monthly credits than a user contributing Business Information as described above.\nInformation that may be collected from the user\u2019s email client includes the following, if available:\n\nName\nEmail address\nJob title and department\nPhone numbers (general or direct business numbers, faxes and/or mobile numbers)\nCompany name\nPostal address of company\nBusiness-related postal address of person\nCorporate website URLs\nSocial media URLs\nMetadata such as Internet Protocol addresses, the dates email messages are sent or received, and subject line information\nEmail addresses, names, and job titles of recipients and senders\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the Directory, we take the following steps:\n\nBusiness Information Only \u2013 Emails sent to ZoomInfo Lite users from consumer-oriented email services (or \u201cfreemails\u201d) such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo, are disregarded.\nUnattributed \u2013 We do not disclose who contributed particular information using the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor software or other contribution methods, except as discussed below. (See \u201cDisclosures to Service Providers,\u201d \u201cDisclosures for Legal Reasons,\u201d and \u201cDisclosures to a Buyer of the Company\u201d)\nOpt-Out \u2013 Anyone added to the Directory may request to be removed at any time, via email, web, our toll-free number, or by writing to us at the Contact Us address below. We will fulfill such requests as promptly as we can, and in any event within any time period that may be required by applicable law.\n\nZoomInfo does not \u201cread\u201d the body of email messages; our technology automatically extracts only the data we describe in this Policy. We do not collect data from custom fields or notes in the email client.\nInformation extracted may continue to be shared as described above as long as the Software remains installed or the user continues to allow ZoomInfo\u2019s access to the user\u2019s email account. To stop sharing information with ZoomInfo, a user can uninstall the Software at any time or disable ZoomInfo\u2019s access to the user\u2019s email account through the user\u2019s email account settings. Information that has previously been shared with ZoomInfo cannot be unshared by disabling the Software.\nC. How does ZoomInfo handle customer information?Customer Information Collected.
