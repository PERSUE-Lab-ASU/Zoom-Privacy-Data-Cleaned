Introduction</h2><div class="html-content"><p>This brief summary of certain information in this Policy is intended to help you quickly understand what ZoomInfo is, how you can opt out of our database, and the potential outcomes of remaining in our database.</p>
<p>ZoomInfo collects business contact and similar information related to individuals when they are working in their professional or employment capacity and uses this information to create professional profiles of individuals and profiles of businesses. We provide this information to our customers, who are businesses trying to reach business professionals for their own business-to-business sales, marketing, and recruiting activities.</p>
<p>You can opt out of our database by visiting our <a href="/privacy-center/manage-profile">Privacy Center</a>. At the Privacy Center you can also submit an access request or claim your professional profile and update your profile information. Using the Privacy Center is the quickest and easiest way to access your information or have it deleted or corrected. However, if you prefer to email or call us, our contact information is listed under the “Contact Us” section at the end of this Policy.</p>
<p>By remaining in our database, you may be contacted by our customers when they are conducting their business-to-business sales, marketing, and recruiting activities. Communications you receive from our customers may be relevant to your profession or employment role, but we cannot guarantee that you will find such communications to be relevant or of interest to you.</p>

Once we have collected Business Information about a person or company, we may combine multiple data points regarding a single person or company into a Professional or Business Profile. The resulting directory of Professional and Business Profiles (the “<b>Directory</b>”) is then made available to the users of the Site, our customers, and our partners. Business Information that may be provided in a Professional Profile includes name, email address (including business and/or other email addresses, such as “freemails” like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.), job title and department, phone number (general or direct business numbers, faxes, and/or mobile numbers), company name, postal address of company and business-related postal address of the person, employment history, and education history. Professional Profiles may also include links to articles by, about, or quoting an individual, and links to an individual’s social media profiles.</p>
<p>ZoomInfo obtains the data for its Professional and Business Profiles in several ways, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our search technology scans the web and gathers publicly available information.</li>
<li>We license information from other companies.</li>
<li>Our users and customers contribute information about themselves or other people and companies.</li>
<li>Through market research surveys, phone interviews, and other research conducted by our in-house research team.</li>
</ol>
<p>ZoomInfo also makes certain limited Business Information from its Professional Profiles publicly available in our directory pages on our Site (the “<b>Public Directory</b>”). The categories of Business Information that may be made available in the Public Directory include, but are not limited to, past or current name, company, company headquarters telephone number, office address, job title, previous professional experience, professional memberships and affiliations, education information, and/or web links to articles recently written by or about the featured individual.</p>

When subscribing to ZoomInfo Lite, a user may install software offered on the Site known as the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor (the “<b>Software</b>”) or otherwise provide ZoomInfo with access to the user’s email account. If a user installs the Software or otherwise provides ZoomInfo access to an email account, the user allows ZoomInfo to access certain Business Information stored by the application that the user’s computer uses to manage the user’s email and contacts, known as an “email client” (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) or stored by a provider of cloud services for email (e.g., Google). If required to access this Business Information stored on the user’s computer’s email and contact application(s), the user may need to provide ZoomInfo with the necessary username and password information. We use this Business Information to improve the size and quality of our Directory. In exchange for allowing this access, the user receives credits for use on ZoomInfo Lite at no charge under specified terms and conditions (available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/legal/ce-terms-conditions">/legal/ce-terms-conditions</a>). A user may also access ZoomInfo Lite without providing ZoomInfo such information from their email by signing up with their email address instead of connecting their Google or Office 365 account directly. Such users will receive fewer monthly credits than a user contributing Business Information as described above.</p>
<p>Information that may be collected from the user’s email client includes the following, if available:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Name</li>
<li aria-level="1">Email address</li>
<li aria-level="1">Job title and department</li>
<li aria-level="1">Phone numbers (general or direct business numbers, faxes and/or mobile numbers)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Company name</li>
<li aria-level="1">Postal address of company</li>
<li aria-level="1">Business-related postal address of person</li>
<li aria-level="1">Corporate website URLs</li>
<li aria-level="1">Social media URLs</li>
<li aria-level="1">Metadata such as Internet Protocol addresses, the dates email messages are sent or received, and subject line information</li>
<li aria-level="1">Email addresses, names, and job titles of recipients and senders</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the Directory, we take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Business Information Only – Emails sent to ZoomInfo Lite users from consumer-oriented email services (or “freemails”) such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo, are disregarded.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Unattributed – We do not disclose who contributed particular information using the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor software or other contribution methods, except as discussed below. (See “Disclosures to Service Providers,” “Disclosures for Legal Reasons,” and “Disclosures to a Buyer of the Company”)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Opt-Out – Anyone added to the Directory may request to be removed at any time, via email, web, our toll-free number, or by writing to us at the Contact Us address below. We will fulfill such requests as promptly as we can, and in any event within any time period that may be required by applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p>ZoomInfo does not “read” the body of email messages; our technology automatically extracts only the data we describe in this Policy. We do not collect data from custom fields or notes in the email client.</p>
<p>Information extracted may continue to be shared as described above as long as the Software remains installed or the user continues to allow ZoomInfo’s access to the user’s email account. To stop sharing information with ZoomInfo, a user can uninstall the Software at any time or disable ZoomInfo’s access to the user’s email account through the user’s email account settings. Information that has previously been shared with ZoomInfo cannot be unshared by disabling the Software.</p>

<p>Certain users may be provided access to the Services through a company’s license agreement. Such company may require that one or more administrators have global rights to access any and all information of every user who accesses the Services through that company’s ZoomInfo account. Questions or concerns regarding the rights of other individuals in your company to access your information should be addressed to your company.</p>
<p><b>Use of Customer Information</b>. Customer Information may be used for ZoomInfo’s legitimate business interests in connection with a customer or its users’ use of the Site, including to respond to user inquiries and fulfill user requests, complete transactions, provide customer service, send administrative information, and to personalize user experience with the Site. We may use Customer Information to better our understanding of our users in general and to test, develop, improve, and enhance our Services and Site.

<p>ZoomInfo will not disclose Customer Information to any third party except in connection with a legitimate use as set forth in this Policy, in connection with a bona fide legal dispute to which such information is relevant, in response to valid, compulsory legal process, in response to a valid data subject request where required by applicable law, or as otherwise required by law. ZoomInfo will, whenever possible, obtain confidentiality agreements from any service provider to whom Customer Information is disclosed and ensure any recipient service providers are committed to employing appropriate technological security measures.</p>
<p>ZoomInfo employs reasonable security and back-up procedures to protect Customer Information. However, in the unlikely event there is a loss or corruption of Customer Information, ZoomInfo is not responsible or liable for such loss or corruption. We encourage our users to retain copies of all Uploaded Information on their own system.</p>

By accessing, using, and/or submitting information through the Site, including by filling out forms on our website, regardless of whether the form is ultimately submitted, a user of the Site consents to the practices described in this Policy with regard to the information collected about them. If you do not agree with this Policy, you should not submit any information through our Site and you must delete all cookies from your browser cache after visiting the Site and refrain from visiting or using the Site.</p>
<p><b>Managing Professional Profiles.</b> ZoomInfo allows any person to claim their Professional Profile and to update the information listed about them in their Professional Profile. We use the information submitted to update a Professional Profile solely for purposes of verifying the submitter’s identity, updating their Professional Profile information, and honoring their privacy preferences. For additional information, see the “Your Choices” section below.</p>
<p><b>Use of our Services.</b> In order to use certain ZoomInfo Services, users may be required to register. From time to time, we may send information about our products and services to a user’s email address. Recipients are provided with an opportunity to opt out of receiving such emails. We may also communicate with users regarding their use of our Services or Site, including changes to this Policy. Users may have the option to provide additional information when completing surveys in connection with the use of <a href="https://www.comparably.com/">Comparably</a>. Information that may be collected includes information such as age, gender, education, employment history, job titles, salary, years of experience, and benefit information and is governed by Comparably’s privacy policy, available <a href="https://www.comparably.com/info/privacy-policy">here</a>. A more detailed description of how we may collect and use Customer Information can be found in the “Customer Information Collected” section above.</p>
<p><b>Providing information to our customers</b>. We receive information about our customers’ end-users from or on behalf of our customers. Because of the nature of our Services, this information may contain any type of data, but typically includes name, contact information, and company information, such as company name. We may also collect data automatically through use of our Services, as described in the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section below. Any information provided through a website, application, or service on which a customer uses our Services is subject to the customer’s privacy policy and applicable terms. When we provide our Services to a customer, we generally act as a “data processor,” and the customer is considered to be the “data controller,” as further described in the “When ZoomInfo is a Controller” and “When ZoomInfo is a Processor” sections below.</p>
<p><b>Referring a friend.</b> If a user invites a friend to join ZoomInfo, we will ask for such friend’s name and email address, and we will automatically send such friend a one-time email invitation to visit the Site.</p>
<p><b>Purchasing our products and Services.</b> Purchasers of our online subscription-based Services may need to provide credit card or other payment information. We will use that information solely for the purpose of fulfilling the purchase request. We will store credit card or other payment information in an encrypted form and will not sell, share, or use it again without prior consent. (The only exceptions are described in the sections below on “Disclosures to Service Providers,” “Disclosures for Legal Reasons,” and “Disclosures to a Buyer of the Company”).</p>
<p><b>Using Chorus</b>. Our data analytics tools and capabilities enable our customers to collect, store, analyze, and share the contents of audio, video, image, and text-based communications such as phone calls, video calls, emails, chats, webinars, and meetings, along with associated data and documentation. These recordings and analyses thereof may also contain Business Information or personal information, such as names, titles, and contact information. We may reproduce, analyze, summarize, and disclose these files, recordings, and any results of our Services with such customers and their relevant personnel and other team members, and customers may share this information with their personnel or others. We may also use such information as described in the “Customer Information” section above. Customers may have access to features that incorporate automated methods of analysis including artificial intelligence (AI), such as by providing an automated summary of a call with action items. We may collect biometric information of Chorus customers when such customers have provided us with their consent to do so. The collection and use of such biometric information are governed by our <a href="/legal/biometric-privacy-notice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biometric Privacy Notice</a> in addition to this Policy.</p>
<p><b>Using our mobile applications</b>. We collect certain information including your device type, operating system, location, platform used, device ID, and the date of last use, among other non-personally identifiable information, through the downloading and use of our mobile applications. We may also collect other information such as the user’s name, email, company name, and information about the user’s account with us. We may also collect calendar information such as calendar meetings, including meeting participants, meeting description, subject, and date and time of the meeting if a user enables our calendar integration. This information is collected to provide you with certain app features, such as meeting briefs with meeting and contact details within the app.</p>
<p><b>Using ZoomInfo Integrations</b>. As part of the Services, ZoomInfo may make available to its customers certain “<b>Integrations</b>.” In using ZoomInfo’s Integrations, such as ZoomInfo’s SFNA and web browser extensions, Business Information from a customer’s CRM, MAT, or sales enablement software may be transmitted to ZoomInfo for purposes of matching or cleansing the customer’s data against ZoomInfo’s database as a feature of the Services. In that event, ZoomInfo may retain and store such Business Information for purposes of identifying potential contacts to supplement the Services, verifying the accuracy of such Business Information, removing out-of-date Business Information from the Services, or otherwise improving ZoomInfo’s research processes and the content provided through the Services. Information so received may be difficult to attribute to one specific source, and we will not disclose the source of particular data, if available, except as required by law or with the customer’s consent. Customers who wish to opt out of ZoomInfo’s use of such information may do so by visiting the ‘Data Sharing’ settings page within the ZoomInfo Admin Portal and adjusting the appropriate controls.</p>
<p><b>Connecting</b> <b>the Services to an email account or calendar.</b> In order to provide certain Services, ZoomInfo may require access to the user’s email account and/or calendar (e.g., through G-Suite or Office 365). Depending on the specific Services being used, we may collect email header information, email subjects, email bodies and attachments, and calendar meeting information such as meeting participants, meeting description, subject, and date and time of the meeting. Customers have control over what data is collected, including which mailboxes are connected, whether message attachments or content is collected, and which emails or email domains should not be collected. ZoomInfo’s access to and use of information received from Google Accounts will adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
<p><b>From our affiliates.</b> ZoomInfo may obtain personal information from our affiliates, such as our current and future parents, subsidiaries, or other companies under common control and ownership with ZoomInfo. We may use this information to enhance the information that we already maintain and to improve the accuracy of our records, in addition to other purposes described in this Policy.</p>
<p><b>From third parties.</b> ZoomInfo may obtain personal information from third-party sources such as our service providers and partners. We may use this information to enhance the information that we already maintain and to improve the accuracy of our records, in addition to other purposes described in this Policy.</p>
<p><b>Creation of aggregated information.</b> ZoomInfo may aggregate collected information about our users in a form that does not allow users to be personally identified for the purpose of understanding our customer base and enhancing the Site and the Services that we and our partners and customers can provide you.</p>
<p><b>Creation of information from inferences.</b> We may use personal information we already have in order to draw inferences or to produce scores or ratings such as the “Likely to Listen” score. We use scoring models and algorithms that evaluate selected data points to produce a score predicting the likeliness of an employment prospect to respond to a recruiter’s outreach efforts. We do not make any decisions about individuals, and we do not tell our customers whether or not to reach out to a particular prospect.</p>
<p><b>Automated information collection.</b> We also collect information using cookies and similar technologies, as described below under the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section.</p>
