Personal Data means any information which may potentially allow your identification with reasonable means (for example, email address or name). Non-Personal Data, by contrast, can be defined as any information that does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. This may include, for example, your aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device (e.g. the device you use, the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time, etc.). This section sets out how and when we collect those types of data from you.</p><p><strong>1.1.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Account Information.</strong> When you sign up to our Services, we collect your full name, email address, company's name, company's address, and billing information.</p><p><strong>1.2.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Transaction Information.</strong> Payments you make will typically be processed using Xyte Platform via a third party payment service provider, and we will not collect or store your financial data (e.g. your credit card numbers or bank account). We may still however receive your non-financial Personal Data related to the purchase, such as your name, billing address, e-mail address and the items purchased, in order to fulfill your transaction, billing, and for our accounting, record keeping and other account management purposes.</p><p><strong>1.3.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Usage Information.</strong> When you use our Services, we collect technical information about your interaction with our Services. Such information may include your IP address, unique identifiers (e.g. MAC address) as well as other information which relates to your activity in the Services.</p><p><strong>1.4.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Information from Other Sources.</strong> We may obtain information about you from other sources, including publicly - or commercially- available information, and through third-party data platforms, partners and service providers such as Outreach and ZoomInfo.</p><p><strong>1.5.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Communication Information.</strong> When you send us an email or contact us via the support in our Platform or Website, we collect the Personal Data you provide us. This may include your name, email address and any other information you choose to provide.</p><h4>2.<strong> </strong>Tracking Technologies</h4><p>When you visit or access our Services, we use cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage and similar technologies ("<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>"). These allow us to automatically collect information about you, your device, and your online behavior, in order to enhance your navigation in our Services, improve our Service's performance, perform analytics, customize your experience and offer you, for example.</p><p>There are various ways in which you can manage and control your Tracking Technologies settings. You can change your preferences using our cookie settings tool (however, please note that this tool may only be available in certain jurisdictions). Another method of managing your Tracking Technology preferences is changing your browser settings to send a “Do-Not-Track” signal. In such case, your browser will send us a special signal to stop tracking your activity. However, please note that certain features of the Website may not work properly or effectively if you delete or disable cookies.</p><h4>3.<strong> </strong>Why do we process your Personal Data, and under what legal bases?</h4><p>This section explains the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and outlines the legal bases that underlies our usage.</p></div><div class="table_wrapper"><div class="table_grid"><div id="w-node-ae337c6f-be01-b6b3-b33b-4d1fabca8c8d-9599c109" class="table_grid_header"><strong>Purpose</strong></div><div id="w-node-ab52939c-c01f-f2d1-487f-c8efe51470d0-9599c109" class="table_grid_header"><strong>Legal Basis</strong></div><div id="w-node-a1cbccfa-d161-2241-839c-7297cc889761-9599c109" class="table_grid_cell"><strong>Provision of our Services; support.</strong> We use your Personal Data, such as your name, and email address, for consumer services support purposes.
