Accordingly, whilst Jiminny supports these laws by providing our customers with features and options for how they use our Services \u2013 our customer is solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services and such features, and to ensure that all individuals using Jiminny on their behalf or at their request have given their informed consent to these practices, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording and use of data through our Services are fully met by them, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship.</p>\n<p>Jiminny processes Customer Data, and the personal data contained in it, strictly on our customer\u2019s behalf, in accordance with their reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, to the extent that the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), UK\u2019s General Data Protection Act, UK Data Protection Act (UKDPA) or any similar laws apply, our Customers will be deemed the <strong>\u2018Data Controllers\u2019</strong> (under the GDPR, UK GDPR, UKDPA and similar laws) or \u2018<strong>business</strong>\u2019 (under the CCPA or similar laws) which controls such Customer Data; and Jiminny will be deemed the <strong>\u2018Data Processor\u2019</strong> or <strong>\u2018service provider\u2019</strong> when processing such data.</p>\n<h3><strong><span>1.2.

Data Controller/Processor</span></strong></h2>\n<p>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201c<strong>Data Controller</strong>\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201c<strong>business</strong>\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201c<strong>Data Processor</strong>\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201c<strong>service provider</strong>\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller (or business).

The Customer, as Controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Requests concerning the data they control).</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, each Customer is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their Account Users and Customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data \u2013 including sufficient reference to the processing of their Personal Data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.</p>\n<h3><strong><span>2.2. User Data</span></strong></h3>\n<p>Jiminny is both a \u201c<strong>Data Controller</strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>Data Processor</strong>\u201d of User Data. Such data is processed by Jiminny for its own purposes (as described in Section 3 below), as an independent \u2018Controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our Customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018Processor\u2019.</p>\n<h3><strong><span>2.3. Website, CRM &amp; Prospect Data</span></strong></h3>\n<p>With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of \"<strong>Data Controller</strong>\" (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Notice.

If you are a user of the Platform on behalf of any of our customers, we suggest that you contact your account administrator with any questions.\n1. Data Collection & Processing\n1.1. Customer Data\nCustomer Data is data relating to identifiable individuals (\u201cPersonal Data\u201d), which we analyze, process and manage on our customers\u2019 behalf, as part of the Jiminny Conversation Intelligence Services (\u201cServices\u201d). Specifically, this is data which is contained in call and video recordings, transcripts, e-mails, text messages and other communications and content, as well as data submitted by our Customers (including by connecting their systems with the Services);\nOur Services enable Jiminny Customers to record, transcribe, analyze and share the contents of their business communications, including phone calls, video conferences, emails and text messages, as well as their CRM and customer contacts (collectively, \u201cCustomer Data\u201d).\nCustomer Data typically contains data which relates to identifiable individuals, such as the customer\u2019s sales representatives, prospects, and other parties either taking part in their communications or mentioned there.\nCertain privacy and data protection laws require that call recordings may only be initialized pursuant to one or more of the parties\u2019 consent (whether explicit or implicit, depending on applicable law), or subject to certain restrictions. Accordingly, whilst Jiminny supports these laws by providing our customers with features and options for how they use our Services \u2013 our customer is solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services and such features, and to ensure that all individuals using Jiminny on their behalf or at their request have given their informed consent to these practices, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording and use of data through our Services are fully met by them, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship.\nJiminny processes Customer Data, and the personal data contained in it, strictly on our customer\u2019s behalf, in accordance with their reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.\nAccordingly, to the extent that the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), UK\u2019s General Data Protection Act, UK Data Protection Act (UKDPA) or any similar laws apply, our Customers will be deemed the \u2018Data Controllers\u2019 (under the GDPR, UK GDPR, UKDPA and similar laws) or \u2018business\u2019 (under the CCPA or similar laws) which controls such Customer Data; and Jiminny will be deemed the \u2018Data Processor\u2019 or \u2018service provider\u2019 when processing such data.\n1.2.

Accordingly, to the extent applicable \u2013 our customer will be deemed the \u2018Data Controller\u2019 or \u2018business\u2019 with respect to such data; Jiminny will also be deemed an independent and separate \u2018Data Controller\u2019 or \u2018business\u2019 with respect to such data; and with respect to those portions or copies of User Data that we process on behalf of our customer \u2013 we will also be deemed a \u2018Data Processor\u2019 or \u2018service provider\u2019.\n\n1.3 Website, CRM & Prospect Data\n\nWebsite, CRM & Prospect Data is data relating to our customers, visitors of our website (www.jiminny.com), participants at our events, and any other prospective customer or partner who visits or otherwise interacts with any of our websites, online ads and content, emails or communications under our control (\u201cSites\u201d).\nWe collect and generate the following types of personal data concerning our website visitors, customers and prospects:\n\nwebsite usage information including connectivity, technical and aggregated usage data, such as user agent, IP addresses, device data (like type, OS, device id, browser version, locale and language settings used), activity logs, session recordings, and the cookies and pixels installed or utilized on their device;\ncustomer account information such as contact, contractual and billing details concerning our customers, which may also contain the details of their internal focal persons who directly engage with Jiminny concerning their organizational account, e.g. the account administrators, billing contacts and authorized signatories on behalf of the customer; as well as the customer\u2019s needs and preferences, as identified to us or recognized through our engagement with them);\ninformation concerning our customers and prospects for example contact and business details, our communications with such customers and prospects (correspondences, call and video recordings, and analyses thereof), as well as any needs, preferences, attributes and insights relevant to our potential engagement).\n\nWe collect such data either automatically, through the data subject\u2019s interaction with us or with our website, Platform or Services; or through third party services, social media, analytics tools, events we organize or participate in, and other business initiatives.\n\n2. Data Controller/Processor\nCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201cData Controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cData Processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.\n2.1. Customer Data\nJiminny is the \u201cData Processor\u201d of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our Customer\u2019s (who are the \u201cData Controllers\u201d of such data.
