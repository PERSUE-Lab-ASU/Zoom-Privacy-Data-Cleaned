We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>\n<li>Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.

We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as in situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In legal terms, we are generally the \u201cdata controller\u201d under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a \u201cdata processor\u201d on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer to whom we provide services and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the \u201cdata controller\u201d responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers\u2019 privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests.</strong></p>\n<p>You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about our collection and use of your personal data if you consider that the collection and use of your personal data violates this Privacy Policy or applicable law. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the European Union (EU).</p>\n<p>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>\n<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.</p>\n<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>\n<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>\n<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>\n<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>\n<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>\n<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or maybe a victim of financial abuse</li>\n<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the</li>\n<li>information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>\n<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>\n<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>\n<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>\n<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you are located in California, this section applies to you.</strong></p>\n<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the \u201cShine The Light\u201d law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
