To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services<br><br>We collect usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services.

For example, we use usage data to assess trends and usage across the product to help us determine what new features or integrations our users may be interested in. <br><br>We may publish data about how our product and services are being used across our customer base. When we share statistical information externally in this way, the data will be aggregated and we will not identify individual users or customers. <br><br>d. To Secure and Protect our Product and Customers and End Users<br><br>We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents. We may also use this information to meet legal requirements. We use your information to verify user accounts, new product sign-ups, and to detect and prevent product abuse. <br><br>We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the website by you, including how you use our website, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns, investigate security events and incidents.

Other Purposes if We Obtain Your Consent<br><br>We share your data with third parties when you give us consent to do so.<br><br>g. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (EEA and UK visitors only) <br><br>Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.<br><br>If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.<br><br><span class="text-span-43">3.

Partners are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your data.<br><br>c. Corporate Events <br><br>If we are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by Guidebook on the website and the Guidebook Platform. In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.<br><br>d.

When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA or UK with third parties, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer including the European Commission-approved Data Privacy Framework Standard Contractual Clauses, as well as additional safeguards where appropriate. Please contact us if you need more information about the legal mechanisms we rely on to transfer personal data outside the EEA and UK.<br><br><span class="text-span-45">5.
