Have any significant security breaches or incidents occurred in the past 5 years?</strong></p>\n<p>A. No.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Are privileged and generic account access tightly controlled and reviewed on a periodic basis, at least&nbsp;<span>annually?</span></strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Are shared user accounts prohibited for employees? What about Clients?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Employees have their own dedicated accounts. Clients also have their own dedicated accounts, with access to their data only.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Does your password construction require multiple strength requirements, i.e. strong passwords and utilizes a random sequence of alpha, numeric and special characters?</strong></p>\n<p>A. We require a minimum 6 characters in passwords on the basic password management level. OWASP and NIST SP 800-63-3 password policy options may be available in the coming year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is the network boundary protected with a firewall with ingress and egress filtering?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes. All firewalls and load balancing facilities are provided by Azure and Amazon AWS.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Are public facing servers in a well-defined De-Militarized Zone (DMZ)?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes, this is inherited from Azure\u2019s default infrastructure zoning and TrueScheduler has regional servers spread throughout the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is internal network segmentation used to further isolate sensitive production resources such as PCI data?</strong></p>\n<p>A. PCI data is not stored as it is only framed by TrueScheduler from 3rd party providers such as Stripe and Authorize.net. TrueScheduler doesnt collect data or store data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is network Intrusion Detection or Prevention implemented and monitored?</strong></p>\n<p>A. A broad spectrum of monitoring tools, supplemented by notifications and alerts provided by Azure remain constantly on. This includes intrusion detection and email confirmations of network access.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Are all desktops protected using regularly updated virus, worm, spyware and malicious code software?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Are servers protected using industry hardening practices? Are the practices documented?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Security services are utilized regularly to provide system security audits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is there active vendor patch management for all operating systems, network devices and applications?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes. This is provided by Azure automatically via their service.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Are all production system errors and security events recorded and preserved?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Logs are preserved for a minimum of 1 month, with some remaining up to 6 months, depending on severity and action required.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Are security events and log data regularly reviewed?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes. Logs are reviewed daily, weekly and monthly \u2013 depending upon the nature of the log events.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Is there a documented privacy program in place with safeguards to ensure protection of client confidential information?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is there a process in place to notify clients if any privacy breach occurs?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Do you store, process, transmit (i.e. \u201chandle\u201d) Personnally Idenfiable Information (PII)?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. In what country or countries is PII stored?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Most of our PII data is stored in the US. However, we are able to store account data for our enterprise customers in a specific regional center. Example. Australian organization could elect to have their data stored in our Canberra Azure location. Or European countries can store in European data center.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Are system logs protected from alteration and destruction?</strong></p>\n<p>A. This is provided by Azure and backed up on Dropbox Cloud Storage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Are boundary and VLAN points of entry protected by intrusion protection and detection devices that provide alerts when under attack?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes. These services are included in our Azure firewall which protects against intrusion and sends automated alerts to our development team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Are logs and events correlated with a tool providing warnings of an attack in progress?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes, our security service includes logging and alerts of attacks in real time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. How is data segregated from other clients within the solution, including networking, front-ends, back-end storage and backups?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Every client account is logically separated from other clients, through the use of a required persistent tenant identifier on all database records.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally all application code requires this tenant identifier for all operations \u2013 both read and write. An automated testing regime is also in place to protect code changes from regressions and possible cross-tenant data contamination.</p>\n\n<p>The tenant identifier is \u201chard linked\u201d to every user account and logically enforced through fixed \u201cWHERE\u201d clauses on database queries and equivalent measures for file access. A platform user is not able to change or otherwise unlink their session or account from this tenant identifier. Thus there is no logical possibility of a user having login authorization under a different tenant identifier. Even if they tried to access pages using a different tenant\u2019s ID, the system would reject the request due to the user account not being registered to the requested tenant ID.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Do you have an Incident Response Plan?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes, a \u201cliving document\u201d is maintained which outlines disaster and incident response</p>\n<p>checklists, contact details and key system facilities for understanding and responding to incidents.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. What level of network protection is implemented?</strong></p>\n<p>A. We utilize Azures Web Application gateway (load balancer) and Next Generation Firewall to protect our network of virtual machines running on Azure Cloud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Does the platform provide reports for Quality of Service (QOS) performance measurements (resource utilization, throughput, availability etc)?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Such metrics are not provided to clients, aside from availability and response timings as per our status page on status.pingdom.com</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is the disaster recovery program tested at least annually?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes, recovery checks and performed and tested annually.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. What is the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of the system?</strong></p>\n<p>A. The RTO is 4 hours, with RPO being 1 hour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Do you provide backup and restore plans for individual clients?</strong></p>\n<p>A. All aspects are multi-tenanted, so backups are taken across entire client base. Complete file backups are run every 24 hours and benefit from Azure database point in time backups taken every 5 minutes. Backups are stored on Dropbox Cloud as well as redundant Azure virtual machines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. What is the maximum time that backups are retained?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Database point-in-time backups are retained for 30 days, with general file backups for 90 days minimum.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. What is the expected turnaround time for a data restore?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Any client restore in any non-disaster scenario must be requested and scheduled with us. Turnaround is between 1 and 2 business days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Can a single entity account be restored without impacting the entire platform?</strong></p>\n<p>A. If restoration of a specific record or artifact is required by a client, this can be performed online via a per request basis and is chargeable work. There is no impact on the platform or client account.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is High Availability provided \u2013 i. e. where one server instance becomes unavailable does another become available?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Multiple server instances are running at all system tiers through Azure\u2019s virtual machine, with Web Application Gateway handling load balancing. Failure of a server instance within the data center is handled by Azure WAG, with the problem instance recycled and/or removed and replaced with a new instance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is data stored and available in another location (data center) to meet disaster recovery requirements?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Yes. All data is replicated to a second data center which differs by geographic location as well as having backup data stored on Dropbox Cloud Storage. .</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q. Is the failover process an active/active, automated switchover process?</strong></p>\n<p>A. Failure of a server instance within the primary data center is handled by Azure WAG load balancers, with the problem instance recycle and/or removed and replaced with a new instance.</p>\n<p>In the event that the entire data center were to have a critical failure, then switchover to the secondary center is a manual process, as we need to perform a full assessment of the issue first to ensure there is no simple workarounds to keep the existing primary center presence available.
