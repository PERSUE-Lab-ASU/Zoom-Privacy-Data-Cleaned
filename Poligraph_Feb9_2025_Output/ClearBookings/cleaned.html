<h2>DATA INTEGRITY AND SECURITY</h2>
<p>We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of Personal Data in our databases and to protect the privacy and security of our databases.  We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard security technology. The employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have access to Personal Data have been trained to handle such data properly and in accordance with our security protocols.  They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorised disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we take all reasonable steps to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a personal data breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<h2>DATA ACCESS AND CORRECTIONS</h2>
<p>With respect to Event Organisers, upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to identify your Personal Data, we will disclose to you the Personal Data we hold about you. We will also correct, amend or delete any Personal Data that is inaccurate.</p>
<p>With respect to Registrants, you will need to make contact with the Event Organiser.</p>
<p>Your request will be dealt with promptly and in any event will not take more than one month to process. You should include any personal identifiers which you have supplied during your visit to our website (e.g. name, e-mail address etc).</p>
<p>If, as an Event Organiser, you wish to access or correct your Personal Data or if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or concerns about the way we process your Personal Data, please email our data protection officer at info@clearbookings.com or alternatively write to Accounts Administration, ClearBookings Limited, The Portershed, Market St, Galway H91 TCX3, Ireland.  We will need to verify your identity in such circumstances and may request more information or clarifications from you if needed to help us locate and provide you with the Personal Data requested.  With respect to Registrants, you will need to make contact with the Event Organiser.</p>
<p>There is usually no charge applied to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other data subject rights).

<h2>DATA COLLECTION BY THE USE OF GOOGLE ANALYTICS</h2>
<p>Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service. Both Google and Google Analytics use “cookies”. Google Analytics collects information on your operating system, browser, IP address, the previous website visited (Referrer URL) and the date and time you visited our Site. Information about your use of our Site generated by this text file is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google uses this information to analyse your use of our Site, to compile reports on website activity for website operators and provide other services associated with website use and internet use.

<h2>COLLECTION AND SAVING OF USAGE DATA</h2>
<p>We collect and store data, such as the date and time of the website access and the page from which you called up our Site etc., to optimise our Site. This is done anonymously without personally identifying the user of the Site. User profiles are also created by the use of pseudonyms. Here too, there is no link between the person behind the pseudonym and the usage data collected. We only collect this data for statistical purposes to further enhance our Site and make our online presence even more attractive. This data is only collected and saved anonymously or under a pseudonym and cannot be traced back to you as an individual.</p>
<h2>ASSIGNED USE OF DATA</h2>
<p>We adhere to the principle of the assigned use of data and only collect, process and store your personal information for the purpose for which you have communicated it to us. Your personal data will not be passed to third parties without your express permission, where this is not necessary, in the case of Event Organisers to provide the Services or complete the contract, and in the case of Registrants to process the booking. We will also only transmit your personal data to State institutions and authorities authorised to access this information within the scope of our statutory duty of disclosure or if we are obliged to disclose this personal data by a court judgement.</p>
<p>We take data protection within our company very seriously. Our staff and contracted service companies have a duty of confidentiality and adhere to legal data protection regulations.</p>

The Event Organisers can block, rectify or delete at any time personal data that we have saved about them. The Event Organisers can also at any time and without giving a reason revoke the consent they have given us to collect and use their personal data.  The Registrants have identical rights which we will refer to the Event Organisers.  To do so, please contact info@clearbookings.com. We would be happy at any time to answer any other questions you may have about our data protection information and the processing of your Personal Data.</p>
<h2>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</h2>
<p>We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.  If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at info@clearbookings.com.  If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.  Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with this Privacy Statement, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<h2>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.  This means that the period of time for which we store your Personal Data may depend on the type of Personal Data we hold.  To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

<h2>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>
<p>Personal Data may be transferred to our trusted partners and service providers who maintain their servers outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), where the privacy and data protection laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  This is only for the purposes of providing, and to the extent necessary to provide, the Services to you.  There are special requirements set out under Chapter V of the GDPR (with which we would comply) to regulate such data transfers and ensure that adequate security measures are in place to safeguard and maintain the integrity of your Personal Data on transfer.</p>
