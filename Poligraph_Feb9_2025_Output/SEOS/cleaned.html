    What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
</h2>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    This Privacy Policy covers how we treat Personal Data. &amp;ldquo;Personal Data&amp;rdquo; means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual and also includes information referred to as &amp;ldquo;personally identifiable information&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;personal information&amp;rdquo; under applicable data privacy laws, rules or regulations.
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    In this document &amp;quot;Personal Data&amp;quot; shall apply to Personal Data of individual Service users who are not child registrants. References to &amp;quot;Children&amp;#39;s Personal Data&amp;quot; shall only apply to Personal Data of child users of the Services. General references to &amp;quot;data&amp;quot; or &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo; shall apply to all users.
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>

    How is children&amp;#39;s Personal Data treated?
</h2>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    The Children&amp;rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&amp;ldquo;COPPA&amp;rdquo;) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. Moreover, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the &amp;ldquo;GDPR&amp;rdquo;) requires that data controllers obtain consent from the holders of parental responsibility over children who are under 16 years of age before such controllers knowingly collect and process Personal Data from such children.
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from a child under the age of 13 (if such child is located in the United States) or a child under the age of 16 (if such child is located in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom) (in each case, a &amp;ldquo;Child under the Age of Consent&amp;rdquo;) without obtaining verifiable consent from that child&amp;rsquo;s parent or guardian (such consent, &amp;ldquo;Parental Consent&amp;rdquo; and such individual, &amp;ldquo;Parent &amp;rdquo;), except for the limited amount of Personal Data we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (&amp;ldquo;Required Information&amp;rdquo;). Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent. Parental Consent is further described below in the &amp;ldquo;Data about Children&amp;rdquo; section.
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    If you are a Child under the Age of Consent , you may not register for the Services or otherwise disclose any Personal Data to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except that you may share Required Information solely for the purpose of the Company obtaining Parental Consent. You may only interact with the Services under an account created by your Parent who has provided Parental Consent.
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    If you believe that a Child under the Age of Consent has provided us with Personal Data (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at <span class=&quot;c22&quot;>privacy@legnurt.com</span>. We do not condition participation in our Services on disclosure of more Personal Data from a Child under the Age of Consent than is reasonably necessary for that child&amp;rsquo;s participation in the Services, and we do not retain Personal Data from Children under the Age of Consent any longer than is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was disclosed.
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    If you are a Parent of a user of our Services who is a Child under the Age of Consent, you may contact us at any time (<span class=&quot;c22&quot;>privacy@legnurt.com</span>) to ask that (a) we stop collecting Personal Data from such user, (b) we delete any Personal Data already collected from such user (although note that we may further retain and use Anonymized Data as set forth the &amp;ldquo;Data that is Not Personal Data&amp;rdquo; section below), or (c) we stop disclosing Personal Data collected from such user to third parties, but continue to allow for collection and use of Personal Data collected from such user in connection with the Services.
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    If you are a child and your parent has signed up for the Service, you understand that your parent may be able to view all data within or associated with the account, including without limitation progress reports and usage data that tracks your performance on games, assessments and other tests available through the Services.
</p>

    What Personal Data Does Company Collect?
</h2>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    The Personal Data you provide is used for such purposes as providing you the services, answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Company&amp;#39;s products and services, including specials and new features. The Children&amp;#39;s Personal Data you provide shall only be used for creating your individual account (which will allow you to receive progress reports that include tracking your child&amp;#39;s performance and progress). You can choose not to provide us with certain data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.
</p>

</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    <span class=&quot;c1&quot;>If you are a teacher or a school administrator, you may also provide a full name and email address for each applicable child to be able to track progress and distinguish students. Therefore, you may choose to provide a different identifier instead of a child&amp;rsquo;s name for this purpose. You may also provide us with a username and a password for each of the student accounts.</span>
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    <span class=&quot;c1&quot;>It is reasonable to expect that either the parent or the student will provide basic information like the student&amp;#39;s name and email address to facilitate the Course Sessions.</span>
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    <span class=&quot;c21&quot;>Parental Consent:</span>
    <span class=&quot;c1&quot;>&amp;nbsp;Legnurt obtains verifiable parental consent before collecting Personal Data from your child For example, Legnurt may obtain parental consent by sending confirmation email to your email address provided by a teacher or a school administrator or requiring the parent to provide their credit card information in order to register the child for and pay for a Legnurt Class (&amp;ldquo;Parental Consent&amp;rdquo;). If the parent does not provide consent, we will not collect, use or disclose any Personal Data about the child, and the child will not be allowed to use the Services in any way.</span>

We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</span>
</p>
<p class=&quot;c3&quot;>
    <span class=&quot;c1&quot;>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt.

If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</span>

    <span class=&quot;c1&quot;>You may also authorize an agent (an &amp;ldquo;Authorized Agent&amp;rdquo;) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</span>
