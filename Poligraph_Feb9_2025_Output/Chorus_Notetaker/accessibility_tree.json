How We Collect Information ZoomInfo collects data about people and companies through multiple channels, including the web, information provided by our users and customers, information licensed from other companies, and research from our in-house research team. Click on each dropdown below to learn more about how we collect information and the types of information we collect. \u25e6 A. Where does ZoomInfo get the Business Information for its Professional and Business Profiles? ZoomInfo creates profiles of companies (\u201cBusiness Profiles\u201d) and individuals in their professional capacity (\u201cProfessional Profiles\u201d). Once we have collected Business Information about a person or company, we may combine multiple data points regarding a single person or company into a Professional or Business Profile. The resulting directory of Professional and Business Profiles (the \u201cDirectory\u201d) is then made available to the users of the Site, our customers, and our partners. Business Information that may be provided in a Professional Profile includes name, email address (including business and/or other email addresses, such as \u201cfreemails\u201d like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.), job title and department, phone number (general or direct business numbers, faxes, and/or mobile numbers), company name, postal address of company and business-related postal address of the person, employment history, and education history. Professional Profiles may also include links to articles by, about, or quoting an individual, and links to an individual\u2019s social media profiles. ZoomInfo obtains the data for its Professional and Business Profiles in several ways, including: 1. Our search technology scans the web and gathers publicly available information. 2. We license information from other companies. 3. Our users and customers contribute information about themselves or other people and companies. 4. Through market research surveys, phone interviews, and other research conducted by our in-house research team. ZoomInfo also makes certain limited Business Information from its Professional Profiles publicly available in our directory pages on our Site (the \u201cPublic Directory\u201d). The categories of Business Information that may be made available in the Public Directory include, but are not limited to, past or current name, company, company headquarters telephone number, office address, job title, previous professional experience, professional memberships and affiliations, education information, and/or web links to articles recently written by or about the featured individual. \u25e6 B. How does ZoomInfo Lite (formerly Community Edition) and the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor Work? ZoomInfo offers a service called ZoomInfo Lite (formerly \u201cCommunity Edition\u201d). When subscribing to ZoomInfo Lite, a user may install software offered on the Site known as the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor (the \u201cSoftware\u201d) or otherwise provide ZoomInfo with access to the user\u2019s email account. If a user installs the Software or otherwise provides ZoomInfo access to an email account, the user allows ZoomInfo to access certain Business Information stored by the application that the user\u2019s computer uses to manage the user\u2019s email and contacts, known as an \u201cemail client\u201d (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) or stored by a provider of cloud services for email (e.g., Google). If required to access this Business Information stored on the user\u2019s computer\u2019s email and contact application(s), the user may need to provide ZoomInfo with the necessary username and password information. We use this Business Information to improve the size and quality of our Directory. In exchange for allowing this access, the user receives credits for use on ZoomInfo Lite at no charge under specified terms and conditions (available at\u00a0/legal/ce-terms-conditions). A user may also access ZoomInfo Lite without providing ZoomInfo such information from their email by signing up with their email address instead of connecting their Google or Office 365 account directly. Such users will receive fewer monthly credits than a user contributing Business Information as described above. Information that may be collected from the user\u2019s email client includes the following, if available: \u25aa Name \u25aa Email address \u25aa Job title and department \u25aa Phone numbers (general or direct business numbers, faxes and/or mobile numbers) \u25aa Company name \u25aa Postal address of company \u25aa Business-related postal address of person \u25aa Corporate website URLs \u25aa Social media URLs \u25aa Metadata such as Internet Protocol addresses, the dates email messages are sent or received, and subject line information \u25aa Email addresses, names, and job titles of recipients and senders To ensure the integrity of the Directory, we take the following steps: \u25aa Business Information Only \u2013 Emails sent to ZoomInfo Lite users from consumer-oriented email services (or \u201cfreemails\u201d) such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo, are disregarded. \u25aa Unattributed \u2013 We do not disclose who contributed particular information using the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor software or other contribution methods, except as discussed below. (See \u201cDisclosures to Service Providers,\u201d \u201cDisclosures for Legal Reasons,\u201d and \u201cDisclosures to a Buyer of the Company\u201d) \u25aa Opt-Out \u2013 Anyone added to the Directory may request to be removed at any time, via email, web, our toll-free number, or by writing to us at the Contact Us address below. We will fulfill such requests as promptly as we can, and in any event within any time period that may be required by applicable law. ZoomInfo does not \u201cread\u201d the body of email messages; our technology automatically extracts only the data we describe in this Policy. We do not collect data from custom fields or notes in the email client. Information extracted may continue to be shared as described above as long as the Software remains installed or the user continues to allow ZoomInfo\u2019s access to the user\u2019s email account. To stop sharing information with ZoomInfo, a user can uninstall the Software at any time or disable ZoomInfo\u2019s access to the user\u2019s email account through the user\u2019s email account settings. Information that has previously been shared with ZoomInfo cannot be unshared by disabling the Software. \u25e6 C. How does ZoomInfo handle customer information? Customer Information Collected. ZoomInfo may collect the following information from or regarding its customers: (1) personal contact information regarding users of the Services (\u201cUser Information\u201d); (2) information uploaded or otherwise provided to our system by a user of the Services (\u201cUploaded Information\u201d); (3) usage logs regarding the use of the Site and Services, including logins and other actions taken, time stamps, IP address, device or other ID, and other usage data (\u201cUsage Logs\u201d); and (4) any other information from or relating to users of our Services (\u201cRelated Information\u201d) (collectively, \u201cCustomer Information\u201d). Certain users may be provided access to the Services through a company\u2019s license agreement. Such company may require that one or more administrators have global rights to access any and all information of every user who accesses the Services through that company\u2019s ZoomInfo account. Questions or concerns regarding the rights of other individuals in your company to access your information should be addressed to your company. Use of Customer Information. Customer Information may be used for ZoomInfo\u2019s legitimate business interests in connection with a customer or its users\u2019 use of the Site, including to respond to user inquiries and fulfill user requests, complete transactions, provide customer service, send administrative information, and to personalize user experience with the Site. We may use Customer Information to better our understanding of our users in general and to test, develop, improve, and enhance our Services and Site. We may use Customer Information to contact customers or their users in the future about services, promotions, opportunities, and other general information about ZoomInfo. We may use Customer Information to investigate and prosecute potential breaches of ZoomInfo\u2019s security or license agreements. ZoomInfo will not disclose Customer Information to any third party except in connection with a legitimate use as set forth in this Policy, in connection with a bona fide legal dispute to which such information is relevant, in response to valid, compulsory legal process, in response to a valid data subject request where required by applicable law, or as otherwise required by law. ZoomInfo will, whenever possible, obtain confidentiality agreements from any service provider to whom Customer Information is disclosed and ensure any recipient service providers are committed to employing appropriate technological security measures. ZoomInfo employs reasonable security and back-up procedures to protect Customer Information. However, in the unlikely event there is a loss or corruption of Customer Information, ZoomInfo is not responsible or liable for such loss or corruption. We encourage our users to retain copies of all Uploaded Information on their own system. \u25e6 D. How else does ZoomInfo Collect Information?

Referring a friend. If a user invites a friend to join ZoomInfo, we will ask for such friend\u2019s name and email address, and we will automatically send such friend a one-time email invitation to visit the Site. Purchasing our products and Services. Purchasers of our online subscription-based Services may need to provide credit card or other payment information. We will use that information solely for the purpose of fulfilling the purchase request. We will store credit card or other payment information in an encrypted form and will not sell, share, or use it again without prior consent. (The only exceptions are described in the sections below on \u201cDisclosures to Service Providers,\u201d \u201cDisclosures for Legal Reasons,\u201d and \u201cDisclosures to a Buyer of the Company\u201d). Using Chorus.

As part of the Services, ZoomInfo may make available to its customers certain \u201cIntegrations.\u201d In using ZoomInfo\u2019s Integrations, such as ZoomInfo\u2019s SFNA and web browser extensions, Business Information from a customer\u2019s CRM, MAT, or sales enablement software may be transmitted to ZoomInfo for purposes of matching or cleansing the customer\u2019s data against ZoomInfo\u2019s database as a feature of the Services. In that event, ZoomInfo may retain and store such Business Information for purposes of identifying potential contacts to supplement the Services, verifying the accuracy of such Business Information, removing out-of-date Business Information from the Services, or otherwise improving ZoomInfo\u2019s research processes and the content provided through the Services. Information so received may be difficult to attribute to one specific source, and we will not disclose the source of particular data, if available, except as required by law or with the customer\u2019s consent. Customers who wish to opt out of ZoomInfo\u2019s use of such information may do so by visiting the \u2018Data Sharing\u2019 settings page within the ZoomInfo Admin Portal and adjusting the appropriate controls.

Creation of information from inferences. We may use personal information we already have in order to draw inferences or to produce scores or ratings such as the \u201cLikely to Listen\u201d score. We use scoring models and algorithms that evaluate selected data points to produce a score predicting the likeliness of an employment prospect to respond to a recruiter\u2019s outreach efforts. We do not make any decisions about individuals, and we do not tell our customers whether or not to reach out to a particular prospect. Automated information collection.

How does ZoomInfo Lite (formerly Community Edition) and the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor Work? ZoomInfo offers a service called ZoomInfo Lite (formerly \u201cCommunity Edition\u201d). When subscribing to ZoomInfo Lite, a user may install software offered on the Site known as the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor (the \u201cSoftware\u201d) or otherwise provide ZoomInfo with access to the user\u2019s email account. If a user installs the Software or otherwise provides ZoomInfo access to an email account, the user allows ZoomInfo to access certain Business Information stored by the application that the user\u2019s computer uses to manage the user\u2019s email and contacts, known as an \u201cemail client\u201d (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) or stored by a provider of cloud services for email (e.g., Google). If required to access this Business Information stored on the user\u2019s computer\u2019s email and contact application(s), the user may need to provide ZoomInfo with the necessary username and password information.
