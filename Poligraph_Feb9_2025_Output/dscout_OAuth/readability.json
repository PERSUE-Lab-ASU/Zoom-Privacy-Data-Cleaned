We collect information when you provide information directly to us, when you permit third parties to provide information to us, and automatically, such as information collected from your browser or device. You can use some of the Platform without providing any information other than that automatically collected as described below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(a) Required Registration Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Researchers must create an account in order to access the Platform. To access limited features of the Platform, Researchers may sign up for a free researcher account, which requires email, company name, and password.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(b) Project and Mission Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>To build a Mission, Researchers must provide certain information for the creation of project and Mission components, including but not limited to a project name, Mission overview, Screener materials, specs for each Mission part, and survey questions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(c) Automatically Collected Information</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Usage Information and Analytics. </strong>In addition to any information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies including Hubspot and Google Analytics, use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Platform (\"Usage Information\"). This Usage Information includes the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to the Platform, all of the areas within the Platform that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. In addition, we collect the IP address or other unique identifier (\"Device Identifier\") for a User's computer or other device used to access the Platform (a \"Device\"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to a Device used to access the Platform, and our computers identify a Device by its Device Identifier.</li></ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advertisements on Other Websites.</strong> We display advertisements for dscout on other websites and services. When you click on a dscout advertisement on these other websites and services, we receive information about the website or service that served the advertisement, and which advertisement you clicked. If you then interact with our Platform, we may combine the information about your activity with our advertisement with the information we subsequently collect and/or you subsequently submit on our website.</li></ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Email Receipt.</strong> If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</li></ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of the methods that we use to collect Usage Information, include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods hereafter developed):</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Cookies and Beacons</strong></p>\n<p>A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platform. Web beacons consist of a small string of software code on your browser that works with cookies to monitor usage. Cookies and beacons may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences, tracking your visits to the Platform and personalizing your experiences on the Platform. If you choose to disable cookies or beacons on your Device, some features of the Platform may not function properly. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including flash cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Embedded Scripts</strong></p>\n<p>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Platform, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are accessing the Platform, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(d) Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong></p>\n\n<p>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you online with outside records from third parties, including networking and marketing resources, in order to enhance our ability to serve you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Platform. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any such information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(e) Information You Provide About a Third Party</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you send someone else a communication from the Platform, such as sending an invitation to a friend or colleague, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. <br></p>\n\n<p><strong>(f) Payment and Tax Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are a Researcher, the Platform may collect payment information, such as credit card information and associated account information (name and contact information of your point of contact). Credit card information is stored by a trusted third party payment processor. Our payment partner will share your payment information with credit card companies to process actual payments.</p>\n    </section>\n                                                                            \n                                                                                <section data-block=\"richText\">\n        <h3><strong>(2) How Do We Use the Information Collected?</strong></h3>\n<p>We may use your information:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>to provide you with information or the Platform;</li>\n<li>to process transactions or payments;</li>\n<li>to process your registration to the Platform, including verifying your information is active and valid;</li>\n<li>to establish and conduct Missions;</li>\n<li>to analyze and synthesize research findings;</li>\n<li>to enhance or improve the Platform;</li>\n<li>to customize your experience on the Platform, or to provide you specific content that is most relevant to you;</li>\n<li>to contact you (such as via e-mail) with regard to your use of the Platform and, in our discretion, changes to the Platform and/or the Platform's policies;</li>\n<li>to send offers and promotional materials related to the Platform and for other dscout marketing purposes;</li>\n<li>for dscout's advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities;</li>\n<li>to transcribe interviews and/or videos;</li>\n<li>to analyze use of the Platform;</li>\n<li>for internal business purposes;</li>\n<li>for other purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy;</li>\n<li>to comply with any procedures, laws and regulations which apply to us, to comply with our legal obligations or, otherwise, where it is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others; or</li>\n<li>to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights where it is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others.</li></ul>\n<p>We reserve the right to create and use anonymous information-information that cannot reasonably identify you or your device or as otherwise defined by applicable law-for any purpose and to disclose such information to third parties in our sole discretion.<br></p>\n    </section>\n                                                                            \n                                                                                <section data-block=\"richText\">\n        <h3><strong>(3) How and When Do We Disclose Your Information to Third Parties?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>(a) Mission Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>We disclose information about Missions to potential Scouts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(b) When You Agree to Receive Information from Third Parties</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you consent to have your information disclosed, your information will be disclosed to such third parties and all information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third parties.

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover information provided by or collected from Scouts. Those privacy rights are governed by the dscout Scout Terms and Conditions and Scout Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not cover any information collected at any other web site, application or offline by dscout (unless specifically stated). Under applicable law, dscout is considered the \"data controller\" of information from or about our Platform visitors. In other words, dscout is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, share, and disclose this information.\n\n\nPlease review this Privacy Policy carefully.

We collect information when you provide information directly to us, when you permit third parties to provide information to us, and automatically, such as information collected from your browser or device. You can use some of the Platform without providing any information other than that automatically collected as described below.\n\n(a) Required Registration Information\n\nResearchers must create an account in order to access the Platform. To access limited features of the Platform, Researchers may sign up for a free researcher account, which requires email, company name, and password.\n\n(b) Project and Mission Information\n\nTo build a Mission, Researchers must provide certain information for the creation of project and Mission components, including but not limited to a project name, Mission overview, Screener materials, specs for each Mission part, and survey questions.\n\n(c) Automatically Collected Information\n\n\nUsage Information and Analytics. In addition to any information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies including Hubspot and Google Analytics, use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Platform (\"Usage Information\"). This Usage Information includes the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to the Platform, all of the areas within the Platform that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. In addition, we collect the IP address or other unique identifier (\"Device Identifier\") for a User's computer or other device used to access the Platform (a \"Device\"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to a Device used to access the Platform, and our computers identify a Device by its Device Identifier.\n\nAdvertisements on Other Websites. We display advertisements for dscout on other websites and services. When you click on a dscout advertisement on these other websites and services, we receive information about the website or service that served the advertisement, and which advertisement you clicked. If you then interact with our Platform, we may combine the information about your activity with our advertisement with the information we subsequently collect and/or you subsequently submit on our website.\n\nEmail Receipt. If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.\n\nSome of the methods that we use to collect Usage Information, include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods hereafter developed):\nCookies and Beacons\nA cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platform. Web beacons consist of a small string of software code on your browser that works with cookies to monitor usage. Cookies and beacons may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences, tracking your visits to the Platform and personalizing your experiences on the Platform. If you choose to disable cookies or beacons on your Device, some features of the Platform may not function properly. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including flash cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website.\n\nEmbedded Scripts\nAn embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Platform, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are accessing the Platform, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.\n\n(d) Information Third Parties Provide About You\n\nWe may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you online with outside records from third parties, including networking and marketing resources, in order to enhance our ability to serve you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Platform.
