In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws.Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our Websites, including the pages accessed and links clicked.Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Websites, where they come from, and what content on our Websites is of interest to them. We use this information for internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Websites to our visitors.Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading \u201cCookies and similar tracking technology\u201d below.\u00a0\u00a0When you use our products and services, we may collect certain information automatically in order to provide our products and services, to improve our products and services, to investigate potential security issues, and to prevent fraud or misuse of our products and services. \u00a0When you communicate with us, we may also automatically collect information related to our correspondence with you, such as emails and text messages sent or received.\u00a0Information that we obtain from third party sources\u00a0From time to time, we may receive personal data about you from third-party sources\u2013 including, but not limited to, lead generation providers, partners, content syndication providers, third-party enrichment tools, and meeting maker vendors\u2013but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal data to us.The types of information we collect from third parties\u2014including, but not limited to, name, contact information, title and/or role within your organization, internet activity, and company data\u2013is used to market our services to you.\u00a0Sensitive Personal DataWe may collect sensitive personal data, or special category personal data, from customers as a part of providing our services.

Website owners can use cookies for a variety of reasons that can include enabling their websites to work (or work more efficiently), providing personalized content and advertising, and creating website analytics.\u00a0Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Fivetran) are called \"first-party cookies.\" Only the website owner can access the first-party cookies it sets. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called \"third-party cookies.\u201d Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content, and social sharing). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits other websites that have partnered with them. Please view our cookie list for more information on the third-party vendors we use at\u00a0https://www.fivetran.com/cookie-list.Fivetran may use web beacons, tags, flash cookies, HTML5, and scripts (\u201cData Tools\u201d) in our Websites or emails to help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. Fivetran may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service and analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.If you want to learn more about cookies, or how to control, disable or delete them, please visit\u00a0http://www.allaboutcookies.org\u00a0for detailed guidance. For further information on how to manage flash cookies, please click\u00a0here.Why do we use cookies?We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons that are strictly necessary for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as \"essential\" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to provide website functionality, or to enhance visitors' experience on our Websites by providing them with personalized content and advertising. This is described in more detail below.Cookies collect certain standard information that your browser sends to the Websites such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at a Website. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take when you use the Websites), and product information. These are called first-party cookies and they are essential to the Websites\u2019 operation.Fivetran may also contract with third-party advertising networks that collect non-personally identifiable information and personal data through the Websites, emails, and on third-party websites. Advertising networks follow your online activities over time by collecting usage data through Data Tools and use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other websites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of Fivetran\u2019s marketing efforts.The Websites may include third-party social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and third-party widgets, such as the \u2018Share This\u2019 button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Websites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Websites, and set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interaction with these features is governed by the privacy policy of the third-party company providing such features.We use third-party advertising companies to display ads on the Websites tailored to your individual interests based on your internet activity, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. You can manage your preferences with regards to the receipt of tailored advertisements in the cookie settings described under the \u201cHow can you control cookies?\u201d heading below. Please note if third-party cookies are switched off, you will continue to see advertisements, but they will no longer be tailored to your interests.The specific types of first-party and third-party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in our\u00a0cookie settings page\u00a0and in our cookie list at\u00a0https://www.fivetran.com/cookie-list.What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called \"tracking pixels\" or \"clear gifs\"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, which means declining cookies will often impair their functionality.How can you control cookies?You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences in our\u00a0cookie settings page. \u00a0Our cookie consent tool automatically honors Global Privacy Control (\u201cGPC\u201d) and Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) signals. Please be aware, however, that due to technical limitations in how opt-out tools store preferences, opt-out choices you make will apply only to the device and browser you are using at the time you make the request.
