Privacy protection is very important to us and we are committed to protecting you and respecting your privacy. This privacy policy sets out information about how we collect, store, process, transfer, share and use data that identifies or is associated with you when providing our Service (hereinafter \u201cpersonal information\u201d).1.3 The Service is operated by MAZE.DESIGN INC. (\u201cMaze\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) and we act as a data controller in relation to the personal information we hold about you. Our registered address is 800 Menlo Ave, Suite 220, Menlo Park, CA 94025.2. Our role in relation to your personal information2.1 We process two broad categories of personal information when you access the Service:your personal information as a business customer (or potential business customer) of the Service, or as a user of our website or mobile application (hereinafter \u201cCustomer Data\u201d); andyour personal information that we received from a business customer who signed you up as a tester/participant on the Service (hereinafter \u201cParticipant Data\u201d).2.2 For the purposes of data protection laws, we act as: (i) the controller of Customer Data, but as (ii) a processor of Participant Data (acting on behalf of the business customer who provided your personal information to us in the first place). A controller decides why and how to process personal information. A processor processes personal information on behalf of a controller based on the controller\u2019s instructions.3. Personal information we collect about you and how we use itCustomer Data3.1 We collect Customer Data about you when you voluntarily submit such data directly to us through our Service. This can include information you provide to us when you register with us, edit your profile, uploaded content, purchase services, correspond with us, respond to a survey, enter a promotion or use some other feature of our Service.3.2 At various places on our site you may be requested to enter certain personal information. Personal information that must be provided in order to use the requested services will be indicated at the time of collection. If you choose not to provide this personal information, we may not be able to provide some or all of the features and functionalities of the Service to you or respond to your other requests. Other personal information that you are not required to provide in order to receive our services may be voluntarily given and you are free to decide not to give such personal information.3.3 The annexes sets out the categories of Customer Data we collect about you and how we use that information.

This allows us to provide you with a personalised experience regardless of how you interact with us.3.6 We may also link or combine the Customer Data we collect directly from you and other personal data we collect about you using publicly-accessible sources such as ZoomInfo, Clearbit or LinkedIn. All additional personal data collected from these third-party sources has been made public by you.3.7\u00a0We may anonymise and aggregate any of the Customer Data we collect about you (so that it does not directly identify you). We may use such anonymised information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving our site and developing new products and features.Participant Data3.8 We do not collect Participant Data for our own purposes. Instead, we receive such Participant Data about you from the business customer who signed you up as a participant on the Service, or collect it directly from you for the benefit of, and on instructions from, the business customer who signed you up as a participant on the Service. Maze allows Customers to make screen recordings of Participant activity on a web site or application that are part of a Maze (\u201cRecording\u201d).
