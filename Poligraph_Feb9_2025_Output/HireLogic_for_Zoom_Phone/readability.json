If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we may place on your browser a cookie that allows us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the websites and to process your online transactions and requests.\nBecause required cookies are essential to operate the Websites, there is no option to opt out of these cookies.\n\n\nFunctional cookies\nFunctional cookies enhance functions, performance, and services on the Websites. Some examples include: cookies used to analyze site traffic, cookies used for market research, and cookies used to display advertising that is not directed to a particular individual. Functional cookies may also be used to improve how our Websites function and to help us provide you with more relevant communications, including marketing communications. These cookies collect information about how our websites are used, including which pages are viewed most often.

Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers\u2019 DNT signals with respect to our Websites. HireLogic takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.\nGoogle Analytics\u00a0\u2013 We use Google Analytics to help us manage and improve the Website and Services.
