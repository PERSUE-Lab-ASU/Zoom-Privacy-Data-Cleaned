<p><br></p>
<p>3.3 Data we collect from Google Workspace</p>
<p>If using The Service in conjunction with Google Workspace, please note that the Google Workspace APIs are not used to develop, improve, or train generalized or public AI and/or ML models.</p>
<p><strong>4. What device and usage data do we process?</strong></p>
<p>We use common information-gathering tools, such as tools for collecting usage data, cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies to automatically collect information that may contain Personal Data as you navigate our Websites, our Services, or interact with emails we have sent to you.</p>
<p>4.1 Device and usage data</p>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically when individual users visit our Websites. This information may include identifiers, commercial information, and internet activity information such as IP address (or proxy server information), device and application information, identification numbers and features, location, browser type, plug-ins, integrations, Internet service provider, mobile carrier, the pages and files viewed, searches, referring website, app or ad, operating system, system configuration information, advertising and language preferences, date and time stamps associated with your usage, and frequency of visits to the Websites. This information is used to analyze overall trends, help us provide and improve our Websites, offer a tailored experience for users, and secure and maintain our Websites. Please note that this device and usage data is primarily used to identify the uniqueness of each user logging on (as opposed to specific individuals), apart from where it is strictly required to identify an individual for security purposes or as required as part of our provision of the services to our customers.</p>
<p>4.2 Cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies</p>
<p>We use technologies such as web beacons, pixels, tags, and JavaScript, alone or in conjunction with cookies, to gather information about the use of our Websites and how people interact with our Services and emails. When you visit our Websites, we, or an authorized third party, may place a cookie on your device that collects information, including Personal Data, about your online activities over time and across different sites. Cookies allow us to track use, infer-browsing preferences, and improve and customize your online experience.</p>
<p>We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our Websites. Session-based cookies exist only during a single session and disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off the device. Persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser or turn your device off.</p>
<p>We also use web beacons and pixels on our websites and in emails. For example, we may place a pixel in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email. We use these technologies to operate and improve our websites and marketing emails. For instructions on how to unsubscribe from our marketing emails, please see Section 7.4 below.</p>
<p>The following describes how we use different categories of cookies and similar technologies and your options for managing the data collection settings of these technologies:</p>

<tr>
<td>Required cookies</td>
<td>Required cookies are necessary for basic website functionality. Some examples include: session cookies needed to transmit the website, authentication cookies, and security cookies. If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we may place on your browser a cookie that allows us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the websites and to process your online transactions and requests.</td>
<td>Because required cookies are essential to operate the Websites, there is no option to opt out of these cookies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Functional cookies</td>
<td>Functional cookies enhance functions, performance, and services on the Websites. Some examples include: cookies used to analyze site traffic, cookies used for market research, and cookies used to display advertising that is not directed to a particular individual. Functional cookies may also be used to improve how our Websites function and to help us provide you with more relevant communications, including marketing communications. These cookies collect information about how our websites are used, including which pages are viewed most often. We may use our own technology or third-party technology to track and analyze usage information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.</td>
<td>You can choose to opt out of functional cookies. To change your cookie settings and preferences, or to disable cookies, see below in Section 4.3.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Advertising cookies</td>
<td>Advertising cookies track activity across websites in order to understand a viewer’s interests, and to direct marketing to them. These cookies are used by a website you are visiting or by third parties to show you ads for products that may interest you on devices you use and to track the performance of advertisements across multiple websites. For example, these cookies collect information such as which browser you used when visiting websites.</td>
<td>We do not implement Advertising cookies on our Websites.</td>

<div>
<p>4.3 Opt-Out from the setting of cookies on your individual browser or disable cookies</p>
<p>In many cases you may opt-out from the collection of non-essential device and usage data on your web browser by managing your cookies at the browser or device level.You can find out more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. But be advised that choosing to disable cookies may limit your ability to use some features on our Websites and Services.</p>
<p>While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators. Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our Websites. HireLogic takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
<p><em>Google Analytics</em>&nbsp;– We use Google Analytics to help us manage and improve the Website and Services. Google provides a Browser Add-On that allows you to opt-out by downloading and installing the add-on for your web browser, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>
<p>4.5 Social Media Features</p>
<p>Our Websites may use social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button, the “Tweet” button and other sharing widgets (“Social Media Features”). Social Media Features may allow you to post information about your activities on our Websites to outside platforms and social networks. Social Media Features may also allow you to like or highlight information we have posted on our Websites or our branded social media pages. Social Media Features are either hosted by each respective platform or hosted directly on our Websites. To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the platforms themselves, and you click through to these from our Websites, the platform may receive information showing that you have visited our Websites. If you are logged in to your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit to our Websites with your social media profile.</p>
<p>HireLogic also allows you to log in to certain of our Websites using sign-in services like Facebook Connect. These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Data from these services with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form. Your interactions with Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them.</p>
<p>4.6 Telephony log information</p>
<p>If you use certain features of our services on a mobile device, we may also collect telephony log information (like phone numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls), device event information (such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser language), and location information (through IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide us with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers).</p>

The United States has not sought or received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information is to do so with your consent; where we need the Personal Data for performance of a contract or requested service, or where the collection and use is in our or another’s legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect the Personal Data in question. If we collected your Personal Data with your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
<p>Our retention of your Personal Data and any subsequent communications are based on our legitimate interest in providing you with new and potentially relevant materials based on your geography, role, or company. As always, you can elect to opt out from receiving such future communications.</p>
