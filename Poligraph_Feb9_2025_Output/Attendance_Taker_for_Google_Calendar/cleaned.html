(“ServiceRocket”). Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. At ServiceRocket, we want to make sure your experience using the App after downloading it from our marketplace is both satisfying and safe. If you have any questions at any time please contact ServiceRocket at privacy@servicerocket.com. </p><p>This privacy policy (the “Policy”) explains how we collect and use visitors’ and customers’ information, particularly personal information, and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. By using the Attendance App you accept the practices described in this Policy. &nbsp;This Policy does not describe how other third parties such as Google from whom you download the Attendance App, may use your personal information. </p><p>The use of information collected through the Attendance App is limited to the purpose of providing the service for which you purchased the Attendance Taker for Classroom add-on. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. </p><p>‍</p><h3>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield (if applicable) </h3><p>ServiceRocket (and its parent/subsidiary companies) participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. ServiceRocket is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. &nbsp;To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. https://www.privacyshield.gov </p><p>ServiceRocket is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. &nbsp;ServiceRocket complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. </p><p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, ServiceRocket is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. &nbsp;In certain situations, ServiceRocket may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. </p><p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. &nbsp; </p><p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. </p><p>‍</p><h3>The Information We Collect </h3><p>This Policy applies to all information collected or submitted through Attendance App. The information we collect and use is limited to the purpose for which the customers engage ServiceRocket and other purposes expressly described in this Policy. For example: providing your Google Classroom email address to activate a free trial of Attendance App. The processing of your information or any information you provide through the Attendance App will be done in accordance with the Policy. Personal Information means information or information set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of ServiceRocket to identify an individual. </p><p>Personal information collected through the use of our Attendance App might include: </p><p>•	Email address of the Teacher</p><p>Through our Services, you can also submit information about other people. For example, if you register someone else for a ServiceRocket service, or someone else, other than you, is paying for it, you will need to submit their information. In this circumstance, personal information collected might include: </p><p>•	Email address of the Teacher</p><p>•	First name &amp; Last name</p><p>•	Organization name</p><p>•	Credit/Debit Card Information</p><p>‍</p><h3>Referrals </h3><p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Attendance App, you can share the unique referral link with your friends and colleagues. ServiceRocket does not store any information.</p><p>‍</p><h3>The Way We Use Information </h3><p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order ONLY to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. For example, we may share your personal information like your email address, name, organisation name with our third-party service providers such as credit card processors, to provide the necessary services we use to operate the Services. </p><p>We may also disclose your personal information as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena or bankruptcy proceedings or in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, if ServiceRocket is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sales of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. </p><p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. In the event any of your information is shared with an outside third party for the purposes stated herein, we require such third party to adhere in a written agreement to at least the same level of privacy protection as we afford you and as required by the relevant principles. </p><p>We do not track information via the Attendance App. &nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we NEVER use or share the personal information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. To this end, we would alert you prior to such disclosure and allow you to either electronically as part of the notification or in writing, to opt-out or prohibit us from sharing such information. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Our Commitment To Data Quality </h3><p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information our Attendance App collects is accurate, up to date and complete. In circumstances where your personal information has changed please contact us to enable us to update and correct the information. We may also contact you from time to time to check if our record of your personal information is still correct. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Our Commitment To Data Security </h3><p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from the Attendance App. We use industry standard methods of securing our electronic databases of personal information. For example, when you enter sensitive customer information (such as login credentials), this information is transferred via industry standard Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) and our databases are protected by 2 layers of firewalls. Except as provided elsewhere in this Policy, we limit access to personal information in electronic databases to those people in our organization that have a business need for such access. Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties other than those mentioned above. For example: we may be legally required to disclose information to the government or a third party under certain circumstances such as responding to a subpoena, court order or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at privacy@servicerocket.com. In the unlikely event of a data breach we have in place a Data Breach Response Plan which we will enact.</p><p>All employees and contractors are required to comply with the POLICY-15 Information Security Policy, as well as any policies, processes, and procedures related to it such as POLICY-44 System Development, Acquisition &amp; Maintenance Standard. We place our utmost priority to keep our business, customers, and partners safe. This includes continuously tightening our endpoint- and workload-level security, with tools such as MDM, EDR, and MDR, responding to data &amp; security related incidents with a CSIRT function, and drive clarity and outcome with processes such as PROCESS-257 Incident Response Plan and PROCESS-270 Data Breach Response Plan.</p><p>We shall report all known or suspected breaches of the Institution data, in any format, to the Institution within an hour. The report shall include (1) the name, job title, and contact information of the person reporting the incident; (2) the name, job title, and contact information of the person who discovered the incident; (3) date and time the incident was discovered; (4) nature of the incident (e.g., system level electronic breach, an electronic breach of one computer or device, or a breach of hard copies of records; (5) a description of the information lost or compromised; (6) name of electronic system and possible interconnectivity with other systems; (7) storage medium from which information was lost or compromised; (8) controls in place to prevent unauthorised use of the lost or compromised information; (9) number of individuals potentially affected; and (10) whether law enforcement was contacted.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy </h3><p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to ServiceRocket. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information in the Attendance App from those we actually know are under 13. All the Student information shown in the Attendance App resides with Google. The Attendance App acts as a data processor to read the data directly from the data source and perform the necessary actions without storing additional copy of all Student data. For example: retrieving students list, displaying classroom list(s), sending calendar invites, and generating reports.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Our Commitment to the Handling of Student’s Education Records</h3><p>‍</p><h3>Third Party service providers</h3><p>The Attendance app work alongside with some third party services in order to deliver the designed function.</p><p>We use ChargeBee to manage Client’s payments and subscriptions. The payment processors only provide the customer’s email address, First Name, Last Name, Company Name, and, in the case of ChargeBee, the shipping address for generating invoice. We do not have access to any banking or credit card information of our customers.</p><p>We store and process data in AWS DynamoDB and its servers are located in the Oregon, United States (West) data center. All data are encrypted using the AWS owned CMK and stored in an encrypted table.</p><p>All the email messages were sent by Google Calendar and Google Classroom API. The email address were provided by Google API, provided that permission from the Client. The email messages and email addresses are not stored on our servers.</p><p>We use Google’ Stackdriver logging tool for error tracking and debugging errors. It includes stack traces, error messages and the logs do not include any PII data.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Information Collected on our Website </h3><p>By using our Services, you consent to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with any term of this Policy, please do not use our Services. You are advised that there are inherent risks in transmitting information across the internet. We gather information about our website users collectively. Such information includes the areas that users visit, and the services that users access, most frequently. We will only use this data anonymously and in the aggregate. By doing so, we can optimize the services our website provides to our customers. We may also collect personal information that individuals choose to provide via online forms or by email. Any personal information provided online is treated in the same manner as any personal information collected through other means. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Choice/Opt-Out </h3><p>You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can contact us at privacy@servicerocket.com. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Log Files </h3><p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting </h3><p>The Attendance App does not gather or store any personal information and activities data to do behavioral or re-targeting advertising. We shall not use Education Records to engage in targeted advertising on our site, service or application, or target advertising on any other site, service or application when the targeting is based on any information, including covered information and persistent unique identifiers, that has been acquired because of the use of our site or service, or use information, including persistent unique identifiers, created or gathered by the operator’s site, service or application.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Accessing and Updating your Information </h3><p>Whenever you use our Services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. </p><p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes). </p><p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. Please contact us at privacy@servicerocket.com. We will respond to such queries within a reasonable timeframe. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Data Retention </h3><p>We will retain personal information we process on behalf of yourself for as long as needed to provide the Services to you, subject to our compliance with this Policy. We may further retain and use the information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Changes to This Policy </h3><p>If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on our website prior to the changes becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. We will also keep prior versions of this Policy in an archive for your review. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your agreement to be bound by the changes to the Policy. Your only remedy if you do not accept the terms of this Policy is to discontinue use of the Services. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Enforcement </h3><p>We regularly review our compliance with our Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up within a reasonable timeframe. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly. </p><p>‍</p><h3>How To Contact Us </h3><p>Please contact us if you have one of the following requests: </p><p>•	if you would like to access your personal information collected by us </p><p>•	if you would like us to change any of your personal information </p><p>•	if you would like your personal information removed from our database </p><p>•	if you have a general query relating to this Policy </p><p>To assist us with your request, please provide sufficient information (for example: name, address and contact details) to enable us to locate your record on its database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your request in a timely manner, but no more than 30 business days. </p><p>Should you have other questions or concerns about our Policy, please contact us at privacy@servicerocket.com or: </p><p>ServiceRocket Inc. &nbsp;Attn: Privacy Officer</p><p>2741 Middlefield Rd, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94306 &nbsp;USA </p><p>‍</p><h3>Choice </h3><p>We collect information for our clients, if you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the client that you interact with directly. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Access to Data Controlled by our Clients </h3><p>ServiceRocket acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. </p><p>ServiceRocket has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. </p><p>An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the ServiceRocket’s Client (the data controller).
