<p><em><strong>Application Providers and Event Sponsors</strong></em>: We may disclose&nbsp;relevant connectivity, technical and usage data to the provider(s) of any third-party applications, or if so instructed or permitted by you or your Account Admin, your personal data (such as your User Profile and contact details, as well as relevant technical data) to provider(s) of any third-party integrations or applications added to your Account. We may also share connectivity, technical, and usage data with the provider(s) of third-party applications whose marketplace pages you have visited. Similarly, if you register to any event that we host, organize or sponsor, then with your permission we may disclose your registration details to others, including the hosts, organizers, speakers, services providers and sponsors of that event, so that they may contact you with relevant information and offers, or to fulfill any promotions related to the event.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customers and other Users</em></strong>: Your personal data may be disclosed to the Customer owning the Account to which you are subscribed as a User (including data and communications concerning your User Profile), as well as other Users of that Account. Your personal data and activity within the Services may also be monitored, processed and analyzed by the Account Admin. This includes instances where you contact us for help in resolving an issue specific to a team of which you are a member (and which is managed by the same Customer).</p>
<p>Also, in cases where your personal data appears in boards within that Account that are set as “private” or with limited view privileges, the Account Admin(s) may still access it on behalf of the Customer.</p>
<p>Any content submitted by you to private boards may still be accessed, copied and processed by the Account Admin(s). Your User Profile and personal data will also be made available to all the authorized Users who can view the same board(s) as you. Please note that monday.com is not responsible for and does not control any further disclosure, use or monitoring by or on behalf of the Customer (including sharing of boards or use of broadcast features within the Services), that itself acts as the “Data Controller” of such data (as further described in Section 9 below).</p>
<p>If you register or access the Services using an email address at a domain that is owned by your employer or organization (our Customer), and another team within such Customer’s organization wishes to establish an account on the Services, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info and general use of your Account will become accessible to the Account Admin and Users.</p>
<p><strong><em>Services integrations</em></strong>: You or your Account Admin may choose to integrate your Account on the Services with third-party Services (provided that such integration is supported by our Services). The provider of such integrated third-party Services may receive certain relevant data about or from your Account on the Services, or disclose certain relevant data from the account on the third-party provider’s Services with our Services, depending on the nature and purpose of such integration. Note that we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third-party Services (but do typically require your API key in order to integrate with them). If you do not wish your data to be disclosed to such third-party Services(s), please contact your Account Admin.</p>
<p><strong><em>Feedback or Recommendations</em></strong>: If you submit a public review or feedback, note that we may (at our discretion) store and present your review publicly, on our Sites and Services. If you wish to remove your public review, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@monday.com">support@monday.com</a>.

<p><strong><em>Legal Compliance</em></strong>: In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your personal data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b) disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such disclosure is required to protect the security or integrity of our&nbsp;products and Services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Protecting Rights and Safety</em></strong>: We may disclose your personal data to others if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or safety of monday.com, any of our Users or Customers, or any members of the general public.</p>
<p><strong><em>monday.com&nbsp;Subsidiaries</em></strong>: We disclose personal data internally within our group of companies, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, should monday.com or any of its subsidiaries undergo any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all of its assets, your personal data may be disclosed with the parties involved in such an event. If we believe that such change in control might materially affect your personal data then stored with us, we will notify you of this event and the choices you may have via email or prominent notice on our Services.</p>

<p id="data_cont"><strong>9. Data Controller/Processor</strong></p>
<p>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the “data controller” (or under the CCPA, “business”), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “data processor” (or under the CCPA, “service provider”), who processes such data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.</p>
<p>monday.com Ltd. is the “data controller” of its Prospects’, Users’, Technology Partner’s and Customers’ personal data, as detailed in Section 1 above. Accordingly, we assume the responsibilities of a data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>monday.com is the “data processor” of personal data contained in Customer Data, as submitted by our Customers and their Users to their Account’s boards, items and docs. We process such data on behalf of our Customer (who is the “data controller” of such data) and in accordance with its reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms, our <a href="http://www.monday.com/terms/dpa">Data Processing Addendum</a> (to the extent applicable) and other commercial agreements with such Customer.</p>
<p>Our Customers are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services, and for ensuring that all individuals using the Services on the Customer’s behalf or at their request, as well as all individuals whose personal data may be included in Customer Data processed through the Services, have been provided with adequate notice and given informed consent to the processing of their personal data, where such consent is necessary or advised, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, use or other processing of data through our Services are fully met by the Customer. Our Customers are also responsible for handling data subject rights requests under applicable law, by their Users and other individuals whose data they process through the Services.</p>
<p>If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding personal data we process as a data processor on our Customer’s behalf, including accessing, correcting or deleting your data, please contact the Customer’s Account Admin directly.</p>
