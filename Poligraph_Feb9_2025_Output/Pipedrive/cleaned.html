We have taken steps to implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or destruction of the information you entrust to us. These measures have been audited and certified to industry standards. However, no security system is perfect, and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, including Personal Data, is absolutely safe from intrusion or other unauthorized access by others. You are responsible for protecting your password(s) and other authentication factors and maintaining the security of your devices.

<p dir="ltr" class="puco-text">Pipedrive may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than the one in which you live, including transfers to the United States. To the extent that Personal Data is transferred abroad, Pipedrive will ensure compliance with the requirements of the applicable laws in the respective jurisdiction in line with Pipedrive’s obligations.</p>
<p dir="ltr" class="puco-text">In particular, we offer the following safeguards if Pipedrive transfers Personal Data from jurisdictions with differing data protection laws:</p>
<ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" class="puco-text"><strong>Standard Contractual Clauses: </strong>Pipedrive uses Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission (and the equivalent standard contractual clauses for the UK, where appropriate) for transfers to countries not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission or your local legislature and/or regulator. </p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" class="puco-text"><strong>Data Privacy Framework (DPF):</strong> Pipedrive participates in and complies with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (DPF) set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data of individuals in the European Union and the UK. Pipedrive Inc. has been certified by the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the DPF Principles. In the context of an onward transfer, Pipedrive is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. Pipedrive will remain liable under the DPF Principles if our agent processes your Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Pipedrive is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Notice and the DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the DPF and to view our certification, please visit the <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/" class="puco-link puco-link--display-inline" target="_blank">DPF website</a>. Please note that we do not rely on DPF as a data transfer mechanism. </p></li></ul>
<p dir="ltr" class="puco-text">For information about sharing your Personal Data, onward transfers, and your choices to opt out, please see Sections 5 and 10.2 of this Notice. Pipedrive does not process any “sensitive information” (as defined under the DPF; i.e., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual); furthermore, the Pipedrive Terms of Service forbid you to process any Sensitive Information in the Pipedrive Service (as defined in the Terms of Service). </p>
<p dir="ltr" class="puco-text">In compliance with the DPF Principles, Pipedrive commits to resolving complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data. EU and UK individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our DPF policy should first contact Pipedrive’s Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:dpo@pipedrive.com" class="puco-link puco-link--display-inline">dpo@pipedrive.com</a>.
