For example, we may engage Service Providers to provide services  such as marketing, advertising, communications, infrastructure and IT  services, to provide customer service, and to analyze and enhance data  (including data about users' interactions with our service). These  Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information  in order to provide these functions. In addition, some of the  information we request may be collected by third party providers on our  behalf. We require our Service Providers to agree to take reasonable  steps to keep the personal information that we provide to them secure.  We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information  except in connection with providing their services. The data transfers  are limited to what is strictly necessary for providing the service, and  we pay a great deal of attention to supplementary security measures  (legal, technical and organizational) implemented by our Service  Providers. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Authorised Third Parties</h3> <p>  We share data with third parties when the transfer has been authorised  directly and explicitly by you, the user. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Affiliates</h3> <p>  We may disclose your information to current or future affiliates or  subsidiaries for research, marketing, and other purposes consistent with  this Privacy Notice. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Business Transfers</h3> <p>  We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution,  reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the  transfer of the information described in this Notice. In such  transactions, customer information is typically one of the business  assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If we are  acquired by or merged with another company, if we sell or transfer a  business unit or assets to another company, in the unlikely event of a  bankruptcy proceeding, or as part of any other similar business  transfer, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur. </p> </li> <li> <h3>  Law enforcement, government and regulatory agencies or to other third  parties as required by, and in accordance with applicable law or  regulation </h3> <p>  Within the limits of the applicable laws, we share your personal data to  authorities, law enforcement and government agencies upon their request  in order to prevent criminal activities, meet national security  requirements or respect law enforcement injunctions. Such requests will  be fulfilled only where we are permitted to do so in accordance with  applicable law or regulation. </p> </li> </ul> <p>  We may transfer your data to third parties in countries outside the European  Economic Area. Such transfer will only occur if: </p> <ul> <li>  the country to which the personal data is sent to falls under a Commission  adequacy decision; or </li> <li>  in absence of such decision, under an agreement compliant with EU  requirements regarding the transfer of personal data to data controllers  or data processors outside the EEA (e.g., standard contractual clauses  approved by the Commission). For those transfers, a Transfer Impact  Assessment (TIA) is made by Wooclap. In order for this data transfer to  occur, this assessment should demonstrate that the data transfers are  limited to what is strictly necessary, and protected by appropriate  supplementary measures (legal, technical and organizational) as described  by <a href=\"https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the European Data Protection Board</a>. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h2>Subprocessors</h2> <p>  In order to comply with the provisions set forth by the General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR), we require our subprocessor to have in place a  Data Processing Agreement with us.

For those transfers, a Transfer Impact  Assessment (TIA) is made by Wooclap.

Subject to local law, you may have additional rights  under the laws of your jurisdiction regarding your personal data, such as  the right to complain to your local data protection authority.    Do Not Track. We do not currently recognize or respond to  browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry  standard for compliance. However, Google Analytics\u2019, Hotjar\u2019s and  Mixpanel\u2019s services do honor this signal.    Wooclap do not use, nor intend to use, user-generated content or personal  data to train AI models. Wooclap AI-related features can be disabled into  your account settings or directly for an entire organisation by contacting  your Customer Success Manager.     How long will Wooclap keep your personal data?   Wooclap will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to  fulfill the purpose for which we collected it, and as long as the user  account is active (see below). However, we may have to keep your data for  longer if we have a legal obligation or a legitimate interest for doing so  (e.g., obligation to retain your data in the framework of a criminal  investigation or for tax purposes). Wooclap has a data retention policy  where inactive accounts are deleted after some time. This retention period  can be customised by the Wooclap Client.    Security and storage of information   We have taken reasonable steps to help protect the personal information we  collect such as using SSL encryption everywhere. Unfortunately, no measures  can be guaranteed to provide 100% security. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee  the security of your information in all circumstances.    You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your device  and account by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody  else knows or can easily guess and keeping your log-in and password private.  We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for  any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.    We retain the personal data we collect for so long as reasonably necessary  to fulfill the purposes for which the data was collected, to perform our  contractual and legal obligations, and for any applicable statute of  limitations periods for the purposes of bringing and defending claims.    Finally, if you have any questions about Wooclap's products security or if  you discover any vulnerabilities, you can contact the Wooclap Security team  directly at security@wooclap.com.
