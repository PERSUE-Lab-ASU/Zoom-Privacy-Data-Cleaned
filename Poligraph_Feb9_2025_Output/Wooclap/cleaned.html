We require our Service Providers to agree to take reasonable  steps to keep the personal information that we provide to them secure.  We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information  except in connection with providing their services. The data transfers  are limited to what is strictly necessary for providing the service, and  we pay a great deal of attention to supplementary security measures  (legal, technical and organizational) implemented by our Service  Providers. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Authorised Third Parties</h3> <p>  We share data with third parties when the transfer has been authorised  directly and explicitly by you, the user. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Affiliates</h3> <p>  We may disclose your information to current or future affiliates or  subsidiaries for research, marketing, and other purposes consistent with  this Privacy Notice. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Business Transfers</h3> <p>  We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution,  reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the  transfer of the information described in this Notice. In such  transactions, customer information is typically one of the business  assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If we are  acquired by or merged with another company, if we sell or transfer a  business unit or assets to another company, in the unlikely event of a  bankruptcy proceeding, or as part of any other similar business  transfer, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur. </p> </li> <li> <h3>  Law enforcement, government and regulatory agencies or to other third  parties as required by, and in accordance with applicable law or  regulation </h3> <p>  Within the limits of the applicable laws, we share your personal data to  authorities, law enforcement and government agencies upon their request  in order to prevent criminal activities, meet national security  requirements or respect law enforcement injunctions. Such requests will  be fulfilled only where we are permitted to do so in accordance with  applicable law or regulation. </p> </li> </ul> <p>  We may transfer your data to third parties in countries outside the European  Economic Area. Such transfer will only occur if: </p> <ul> <li>  the country to which the personal data is sent to falls under a Commission  adequacy decision; or </li> <li>  in absence of such decision, under an agreement compliant with EU  requirements regarding the transfer of personal data to data controllers  or data processors outside the EEA (e.g., standard contractual clauses  approved by the Commission). For those transfers, a Transfer Impact  Assessment (TIA) is made by Wooclap. In order for this data transfer to  occur, this assessment should demonstrate that the data transfers are  limited to what is strictly necessary, and protected by appropriate  supplementary measures (legal, technical and organizational) as described  by <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the European Data Protection Board</a>. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h2>Subprocessors</h2> <p>  In order to comply with the provisions set forth by the General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR), we require our subprocessor to have in place a  Data Processing Agreement with us.
