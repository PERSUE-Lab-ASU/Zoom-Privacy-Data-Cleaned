We allow you to choose the information\n              you provide to others through the Site. Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to\n              make informed choices about who has access to your information. We share your information with third\n              parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to provide\n              the Service; 2) legally permitted or required; 3) with your permission. Without limiting the generality of\n              the foregoing, some examples of circumstances under which we may share your personal information are: </p>\n            <p> We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court\n              orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith\n              belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal\n              standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to\n              comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity\n              perpetrated through the Service or using the Site, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include\n              sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. </p>\n            <p> When you use the Site, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a fellow student\n              or colleague), based on your permission settings, such as personal information, comments, messages,\n              photos, videos, or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy\n              settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. You may choose to keep it\n              private, share with classmates, instructors, global classmates, or publicly share. Please keep in mind\n              that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting comments, messages, photos,\n              videos, or other items, this information may become publicly available. </p>\n            <h3>External Links</h3>\n            <p> The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other\n              websites. Users of the Site generate these links and are no way posted, shared, or distributed by the\n              Site. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each\n              and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to\n              information collected by this Site. Once Users leave the Site, the Site is no longer responsible. </p>\n            <h3>Third-party AI Services</h3>\n            <p>\n                In our commitment to enhancing user experience and efficiency, CN integrates with third-party AI technologies. OpenAI\u2019s API is utilized for automated features, such as keyword tagging and quiz question generation. It is important to note that interactions with such AI features involve processing non-personal data using OpenAI or any third-party technology, and your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is never shared with these third parties. OpenAI does not use data CN submitted via API to train their models. To ensure the security of user data, we have also implemented industry-standard measures such as SSL, TLS, and HTTPS encryption. For detailed information on OpenAI\u2019s data handling practices, please refer to OpenAI\u2019s API Privacy Policy.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technologies, our privacy policy is subject to updates in alignment with evolving practices and legal changes. Notably, any significant changes will be promptly communicated to keep you informed about their impact on your use of our AI features.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Data Retention and Removal </h2>\n            <div><p>\n                Access and control over much of your personal information on the Site is readily available through the profile editing tools. \n                You may modify or delete your profile information at any time by logging into your account. \n                All user-uploaded content, including images, files, and videos, will be retained indefinitely unless directly removed by the user or unless the Site account is deleted by the CN team upon user request. \n                Individuals who wish to delete their Site account may do so by contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:help@thecn.com\">help@thecn.com</a>. \n                Since CN executes regular and automatic user-data backups to Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for data security and resilience, \n                the backed-up copy of the deleted data may persist in our archives, but the deleted data will not be available on the Site after deletion. \n                This backed-up data is securely stored in our database and AWS S3 server for up to 6 months and is deleted on a monthly basis. \n                Where you make use of the communication features of the Service to share information with other individuals, \n                (e.g., sending a message to another Site user) you generally cannot remove or delete such communications. \n                If you wish to have this data removed from our servers entirely before it is scheduled to be removed, you must contact <a href=\"mailto:help@thecn.com\">help@thecn.com</a>.\n                </p><p>\n                \n                All backups and snapshots are encrypted to bolster data protection. \n                As we are hosted on AWS, our data centers adhere to the highest standards of physical security, \n                holding ISO 27001, ISO 9001, SOC 3, and other certifications. \n                We utilize AWS EBS Snapshot service for daily backups, storing encrypted backups in different locations on Amazon Cloud. \n                In the event of disasters, our efficient backup restoration process ensures minimal downtime, \n                with a Recovery Time Objective of just a few hours. Your data's security and accessibility are our top priorities. \n            </p></div>\n            <h2>International Privacy Practices</h2>\n            <p> CourseNetworking sites and services are primarily operated on Amazon servers located in the United\n              States. For European users, in order to improve our service and site for users, we may transfer your\n              personally identifiable information from the EEA (European Economic Area) to the U.S. However, during\n              these transfers, we take full precautions and provide the same level of protection as transfers residing\n              in the EEA. As previously mentioned, we use Amazon servers, and through Amazon, we adhere to the EU-U.S.\n              Privacy Shield Framework when transferring data from the EEA to the United States. Please see the <a href=\"https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TOWQAA4\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Privacy Shield Policy</a> certification for more information. </p>\n            <h2>Security</h2>\n            <p> We developed CN using universally accepted best practices for applications that handle sensitive\n              information, and are accessed via the Internet by end-users and partners. These best practices include\n              guidelines for encryption and highly restricted access to back-end development, deployment, and data\n              storage environments. This also covers the OWASP Top 10 recommendations. </p>\n            <p> We have proved proficiency in all audits and security scans conducted by University IT departments. This\n              means that our clients perform inspections and approve of our product suite post-security checks. </p>\n            <h3>Infrastructure Security</h3>\n            <p> We apply established best practices for ensuring our infrastructure is secure: </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li> All traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS with 256-bit encryption (HTTPS). </li>\n              <li> CN servers are guarded by various firewalls, with both external WAN access and internal LAN\n                restrictions&nbsp;- powered by AWS infrastructure. </li>\n              <li> CN server access is given only to the trusted CN employees who require it. </li>\n              <li>CN controls all access logs and records actions made each user.</li>\n              <li> CN employs automatic installations (with no interruption to end-users) for all crucial&nbsp;operating\n                system and application security patches&nbsp;as soon as they are released </li>\n              <li> All servers operate within a Virtual Private Network (VPN) (secure structure of different components\n                of the system), which are only accessible from internal nodes </li>\n              <li> We transfer all of the incoming and outgoing traffic through one secure proxy interface. </li>\n            </ul>\n            <h3>Physical Security</h3>\n            <p> CN is hosted using Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS data centers adhere to the highest standards of\n              physical security and processes and have fulfilled&nbsp;ISO 27001, ISO 9001, SOC 3 and other\n              certifications. For more information on AWS security infrastructure visit http://aws.amazon.com/security/\n              and http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/ </p>\n            <h3>Data Security</h3>\n            <p> Our user-data back-ups to the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) service&nbsp;occur regularly and\n              automatically;&nbsp;additionally, EBS has redundant nodes in different locations.&nbsp;CN stores all data\n              for six months for customers (may be extended per contract terms if necessary). We can also execute a data\n              dump or delete data based on client need.&nbsp;All backups and snapshots are encrypted. </p>\n            <p>Regarding user-data and AWS, we...</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>host our services in the N. Virginia datacenters of Amazon</li>\n              <li> perform daily data backups on a separate server - backups are complete versions of production data\n              </li>\n              <li> use the Mongo DB Replica set which renders higher availability, retrieval performance, reliability,\n                vertical and horizontal scalability, and very low \"Recovery Time Objective\" </li>\n              <li> can extend the number of servers to handle the higher load without any interruption </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p> CN is hosted on thoroughly firewalled servers which automatically disable any unsupported device that\n              tries to access them; the servers are carefully configured to allow access&nbsp;only&nbsp;to known\n              services. Our data centers are only accessible by our internal servers, and no external access is granted.\n            </p>\n            <h3>Data Integrity and Disaster Recovery</h3>\n            <p> CN is designed and meticulously built for&nbsp;High Availability and 99.9999% uptime. We conduct user\n              data backups daily. However, having access to multiple duplicate servers reduce the risk of data loss\n              (close to zero). Essential data and data with the highest usage rates are delivered to users worldwide\n              using CDN to reduce the propagation delay. In addition to providing higher performance and availability,\n              redundant data centers decrease the disaster recovery time (to zero). Therefore, if one or more servers\n              fail, there are backup servers that can replace them immediately, without interruption.&nbsp; </p>\n            <h3>Data Breach</h3>\n            <p> We look for our service providers to provide us timely notification of breaches. If a security breach\n              occurs, we will work with our clients and end-users to notify them promptly.&nbsp;If a data breach should\n              occur, the GDPR specifies that we must provide adequate notification. The affected company has 72 hours to\n              notify the appropriate data protection agency and must inform affected individuals \u201cwithout undue delay.\u201d\n            </p>\n            <h2>Terms of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h2>\n            <p> Your use of the Site and any disputes arising from it is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our\n              Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages,\n              and choice of law.

We allow you to choose the information\n              you provide to others through the Site. Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to\n              make informed choices about who has access to your information. We share your information with third\n              parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to provide\n              the Service; 2) legally permitted or required; 3) with your permission. Without limiting the generality of\n              the foregoing, some examples of circumstances under which we may share your personal information are: \n             We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court\n              orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith\n              belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal\n              standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to\n              comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity\n              perpetrated through the Service or using the Site, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include\n              sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. \n             When you use the Site, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a fellow student\n              or colleague), based on your permission settings, such as personal information, comments, messages,\n              photos, videos, or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy\n              settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. You may choose to keep it\n              private, share with classmates, instructors, global classmates, or publicly share. Please keep in mind\n              that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting comments, messages, photos,\n              videos, or other items, this information may become publicly available. \n            External Links\n             The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other\n              websites. Users of the Site generate these links and are no way posted, shared, or distributed by the\n              Site. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each\n              and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to\n              information collected by this Site. Once Users leave the Site, the Site is no longer responsible. \n            Third-party AI Services\n            \n                In our commitment to enhancing user experience and efficiency, CN integrates with third-party AI technologies. OpenAI\u2019s API is utilized for automated features, such as keyword tagging and quiz question generation. It is important to note that interactions with such AI features involve processing non-personal data using OpenAI or any third-party technology, and your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is never shared with these third parties. OpenAI does not use data CN submitted via API to train their models. To ensure the security of user data, we have also implemented industry-standard measures such as SSL, TLS, and HTTPS encryption. For detailed information on OpenAI\u2019s data handling practices, please refer to OpenAI\u2019s API Privacy Policy.\n            \n            \n                In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technologies, our privacy policy is subject to updates in alignment with evolving practices and legal changes. Notably, any significant changes will be promptly communicated to keep you informed about their impact on your use of our AI features.\n            \n            Data Retention and Removal \n            \n                Access and control over much of your personal information on the Site is readily available through the profile editing tools. \n                You may modify or delete your profile information at any time by logging into your account. \n                All user-uploaded content, including images, files, and videos, will be retained indefinitely unless directly removed by the user or unless the Site account is deleted by the CN team upon user request. \n                Individuals who wish to delete their Site account may do so by contacting us at help@thecn.com. \n                Since CN executes regular and automatic user-data backups to Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for data security and resilience, \n                the backed-up copy of the deleted data may persist in our archives, but the deleted data will not be available on the Site after deletion. \n                This backed-up data is securely stored in our database and AWS S3 server for up to 6 months and is deleted on a monthly basis. \n                Where you make use of the communication features of the Service to share information with other individuals, \n                (e.g., sending a message to another Site user) you generally cannot remove or delete such communications. \n                If you wish to have this data removed from our servers entirely before it is scheduled to be removed, you must contact help@thecn.com.\n                \n                \n                All backups and snapshots are encrypted to bolster data protection. \n                As we are hosted on AWS, our data centers adhere to the highest standards of physical security, \n                holding ISO 27001, ISO 9001, SOC 3, and other certifications. \n                We utilize AWS EBS Snapshot service for daily backups, storing encrypted backups in different locations on Amazon Cloud. \n                In the event of disasters, our efficient backup restoration process ensures minimal downtime, \n                with a Recovery Time Objective of just a few hours. Your data's security and accessibility are our top priorities. \n            \n            International Privacy Practices\n             CourseNetworking sites and services are primarily operated on Amazon servers located in the United\n              States. For European users, in order to improve our service and site for users, we may transfer your\n              personally identifiable information from the EEA (European Economic Area) to the U.S. However, during\n              these transfers, we take full precautions and provide the same level of protection as transfers residing\n              in the EEA. As previously mentioned, we use Amazon servers, and through Amazon, we adhere to the EU-U.S.\n              Privacy Shield Framework when transferring data from the EEA to the United States. Please see the Amazon Privacy Shield Policy certification for more information. \n            Security\n             We developed CN using universally accepted best practices for applications that handle sensitive\n              information, and are accessed via the Internet by end-users and partners. These best practices include\n              guidelines for encryption and highly restricted access to back-end development, deployment, and data\n              storage environments. This also covers the OWASP Top 10 recommendations. \n             We have proved proficiency in all audits and security scans conducted by University IT departments. This\n              means that our clients perform inspections and approve of our product suite post-security checks. \n            Infrastructure Security\n             We apply established best practices for ensuring our infrastructure is secure: \n            \n               All traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS with 256-bit encryption (HTTPS). \n               CN servers are guarded by various firewalls, with both external WAN access and internal LAN\n                restrictions\u00a0- powered by AWS infrastructure. \n               CN server access is given only to the trusted CN employees who require it. \n              CN controls all access logs and records actions made each user.\n               CN employs automatic installations (with no interruption to end-users) for all crucial\u00a0operating\n                system and application security patches\u00a0as soon as they are released \n               All servers operate within a Virtual Private Network (VPN) (secure structure of different components\n                of the system), which are only accessible from internal nodes \n               We transfer all of the incoming and outgoing traffic through one secure proxy interface. \n            \n            Physical Security\n             CN is hosted using Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS data centers adhere to the highest standards of\n              physical security and processes and have fulfilled\u00a0ISO 27001, ISO 9001, SOC 3 and other\n              certifications. For more information on AWS security infrastructure visit http://aws.amazon.com/security/\n              and http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/ \n            Data Security\n             Our user-data back-ups to the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) service\u00a0occur regularly and\n              automatically;\u00a0additionally, EBS has redundant nodes in different locations.\u00a0CN stores all data\n              for six months for customers (may be extended per contract terms if necessary). We can also execute a data\n              dump or delete data based on client need.\u00a0All backups and snapshots are encrypted. \n            Regarding user-data and AWS, we...\n            \n              host our services in the N. Virginia datacenters of Amazon\n               perform daily data backups on a separate server - backups are complete versions of production data\n              \n               use the Mongo DB Replica set which renders higher availability, retrieval performance, reliability,\n                vertical and horizontal scalability, and very low \"Recovery Time Objective\" \n               can extend the number of servers to handle the higher load without any interruption \n            \n             CN is hosted on thoroughly firewalled servers which automatically disable any unsupported device that\n              tries to access them; the servers are carefully configured to allow access\u00a0only\u00a0to known\n              services. Our data centers are only accessible by our internal servers, and no external access is granted.\n            \n            Data Integrity and Disaster Recovery\n             CN is designed and meticulously built for\u00a0High Availability and 99.9999% uptime. We conduct user\n              data backups daily. However, having access to multiple duplicate servers reduce the risk of data loss\n              (close to zero). Essential data and data with the highest usage rates are delivered to users worldwide\n              using CDN to reduce the propagation delay. In addition to providing higher performance and availability,\n              redundant data centers decrease the disaster recovery time (to zero). Therefore, if one or more servers\n              fail, there are backup servers that can replace them immediately, without interruption.\u00a0 \n            Data Breach\n             We look for our service providers to provide us timely notification of breaches. If a security breach\n              occurs, we will work with our clients and end-users to notify them promptly.\u00a0If a data breach should\n              occur, the GDPR specifies that we must provide adequate notification. The affected company has 72 hours to\n              notify the appropriate data protection agency and must inform affected individuals \u201cwithout undue delay.\u201d\n            \n            Terms of Use, Notices, and Revisions\n             Your use of the Site and any disputes arising from it is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our\n              Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages,\n              and choice of law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time and will provide notice\n              to you on the site and via email. Users must accept the terms of use and privacy policy additions, or they\n              will not have access to the CN site. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect immediately,\n              and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we\n              will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the Privacy Policy's new effective date. If we\n              make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through a notice on our home\n              page. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our\n              current Privacy Policy.
