            <p> This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information
              you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using the Site. </p>
            <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
            <p> When you visit the Site, you provide us with two types of information: personal information you
              knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us, and website use information collected by us as you
              interact with our Site. </p>
            <h3>Your Site-Use Information</h3>
            <p> CN collects information based on your use of the Site, your created content you’ve chosen to save to
              your ePortfolio and your social activity with others within the CN platform. This information is stored
              solely so you can go back and review, edit view, etc. If you want to delete a past interaction, your
              created content, etc. you may do so at any time. </p>
            <p> When you enter the Site, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for
              all Site visitors. We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting
              such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each
              user of the Site. We may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and
              the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. </p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p> In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data
              stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm
              that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a
              persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login
              when you come back to the Site. This cookie does not contain any other information except your login ID/CN
              number. In addition, the Company uses SendGrid to send emails to Users. These emails contain cookies and
              web beacons that let SendGrid know what emails are delivered, opened, clicked-on, bounced back, or treated
              as spam solely to improve the service and ensure Users are getting access to important information from
              the Service. </p>
            <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p> When you use the Site, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform
              searches, form groups, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so
              that we can provide you the Service and offer personalized features. When you update your information, we
              may keep a backup copy of the prior version in our archives. These backups stay in our system for 6 months
              on a month-to-month basis. When a new month is saved, the oldest existing month is deleted permanently.
            </p>
            <p> You post User Content (as defined in the Terms of Use [<a href="/tos" target="_blank">https://www.thecn.com/tos</a>]) on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to
              set privacy options that limit access to your pages, we cannot control the actions of other Site users
              with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. We are not responsible for circumvention of
              any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even
              after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users
              have copied or stored your User Content. </p>
            <p> Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on the Site is a violation of the Terms of Use
              and should be reported to info@coursenetworking.com. </p>
            <p> If you choose to use our "Invite a Member" service to invite others to the Site, we will ask you for
              your invitee's email address. We will automatically send your invitee a one-time email inviting him or her
              to visit the Site. The Site stores this information to send this one-time email and to register the user
              if your invitation is accepted. Your invitee may contact us at info@coursenetworking.com to request that
              we remove this information from our database. </p>
            <p> When you register with the Site, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name,
              your email address, your major or interests (optional), and your country. For licensed institutions, we

            <p> Generally, you may opt out of such emails, though the Site reserves the right to send you notices about
              your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications. Licensed institutions may
              completely block user public access and search engines. Individual users may check a box on their own
              ePortfolio/profile to block this feature as well. </p>
            <h2>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h2>
            <p> The Site permits sharing information with other students and colleagues in your networks while providing
              you with privacy settings that restrict access to your information. We allow you to choose the information
              you provide to others through the Site. Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to
              make informed choices about who has access to your information. We share your information with third
              parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to provide
              the Service; 2) legally permitted or required; 3) with your permission. Without limiting the generality of
              the foregoing, some examples of circumstances under which we may share your personal information are: </p>
            <p> We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court
              orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith
              belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal
              standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to
              comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity
              perpetrated through the Service or using the Site, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include
              sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. </p>
            <p> When you use the Site, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a fellow student
              or colleague), based on your permission settings, such as personal information, comments, messages,
              photos, videos, or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy
              settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. You may choose to keep it
              private, share with classmates, instructors, global classmates, or publicly share. Please keep in mind
              that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting comments, messages, photos,
              videos, or other items, this information may become publicly available. </p>
            <h3>External Links</h3>
            <p> The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other
              websites. Users of the Site generate these links and are no way posted, shared, or distributed by the
              Site. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each
              and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to
              information collected by this Site. Once Users leave the Site, the Site is no longer responsible. </p>
            <h3>Third-party AI Services</h3>
            <p>
                In our commitment to enhancing user experience and efficiency, CN integrates with third-party AI technologies. OpenAI’s API is utilized for automated features, such as keyword tagging and quiz question generation. It is important to note that interactions with such AI features involve processing non-personal data using OpenAI or any third-party technology, and your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is never shared with these third parties. OpenAI does not use data CN submitted via API to train their models. To ensure the security of user data, we have also implemented industry-standard measures such as SSL, TLS, and HTTPS encryption. For detailed information on OpenAI’s data handling practices, please refer to OpenAI’s API Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technologies, our privacy policy is subject to updates in alignment with evolving practices and legal changes. Notably, any significant changes will be promptly communicated to keep you informed about their impact on your use of our AI features.
            </p>
            <h2>Data Retention and Removal </h2>
            <p>
                Access and control over much of your personal information on the Site is readily available through the profile editing tools. 
                You may modify or delete your profile information at any time by logging into your account. 
                All user-uploaded content, including images, files, and videos, will be retained indefinitely unless directly removed by the user or unless the Site account is deleted by the CN team upon user request. 
                Individuals who wish to delete their Site account may do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:help@thecn.com">help@thecn.com</a>. 
                Since CN executes regular and automatic user-data backups to Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for data security and resilience, 
                the backed-up copy of the deleted data may persist in our archives, but the deleted data will not be available on the Site after deletion. 
                This backed-up data is securely stored in our database and AWS S3 server for up to 6 months and is deleted on a monthly basis. 
                Where you make use of the communication features of the Service to share information with other individuals, 
                (e.g., sending a message to another Site user) you generally cannot remove or delete such communications. 
                If you wish to have this data removed from our servers entirely before it is scheduled to be removed, you must contact <a href="mailto:help@thecn.com">help@thecn.com</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                All backups and snapshots are encrypted to bolster data protection. 
                As we are hosted on AWS, our data centers adhere to the highest standards of physical security, 
                holding ISO 27001, ISO 9001, SOC 3, and other certifications. 
                We utilize AWS EBS Snapshot service for daily backups, storing encrypted backups in different locations on Amazon Cloud. 
                In the event of disasters, our efficient backup restoration process ensures minimal downtime, 
                with a Recovery Time Objective of just a few hours. Your data's security and accessibility are our top priorities. 
            </p>
            <h2>International Privacy Practices</h2>
            <p> CourseNetworking sites and services are primarily operated on Amazon servers located in the United
              States. For European users, in order to improve our service and site for users, we may transfer your
              personally identifiable information from the EEA (European Economic Area) to the U.S. However, during
              these transfers, we take full precautions and provide the same level of protection as transfers residing
              in the EEA. As previously mentioned, we use Amazon servers, and through Amazon, we adhere to the EU-U.S.
              Privacy Shield Framework when transferring data from the EEA to the United States. Please see the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TOWQAA4" target="_blank">Amazon Privacy Shield Policy</a> certification for more information. </p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p> We developed CN using universally accepted best practices for applications that handle sensitive
              information, and are accessed via the Internet by end-users and partners. These best practices include
              guidelines for encryption and highly restricted access to back-end development, deployment, and data
              storage environments. This also covers the OWASP Top 10 recommendations. </p>
            <p> We have proved proficiency in all audits and security scans conducted by University IT departments. This
              means that our clients perform inspections and approve of our product suite post-security checks. </p>
            <h3>Infrastructure Security</h3>
            <p> We apply established best practices for ensuring our infrastructure is secure: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> All traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS with 256-bit encryption (HTTPS). </li>
              <li> CN servers are guarded by various firewalls, with both external WAN access and internal LAN
                restrictions&nbsp;- powered by AWS infrastructure. </li>
              <li> CN server access is given only to the trusted CN employees who require it. </li>
              <li>CN controls all access logs and records actions made each user.</li>
              <li> CN employs automatic installations (with no interruption to end-users) for all crucial&nbsp;operating
                system and application security patches&nbsp;as soon as they are released </li>
              <li> All servers operate within a Virtual Private Network (VPN) (secure structure of different components
                of the system), which are only accessible from internal nodes </li>
              <li> We transfer all of the incoming and outgoing traffic through one secure proxy interface. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Physical Security</h3>
            <p> CN is hosted using Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS data centers adhere to the highest standards of
              physical security and processes and have fulfilled&nbsp;ISO 27001, ISO 9001, SOC 3 and other
              certifications. For more information on AWS security infrastructure visit http://aws.amazon.com/security/
              and http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/ </p>
            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <p> Our user-data back-ups to the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) service&nbsp;occur regularly and
              automatically;&nbsp;additionally, EBS has redundant nodes in different locations.&nbsp;CN stores all data
              for six months for customers (may be extended per contract terms if necessary). We can also execute a data
              dump or delete data based on client need.&nbsp;All backups and snapshots are encrypted. </p>
            <p>Regarding user-data and AWS, we...</p>
            <ul>
              <li>host our services in the N. Virginia datacenters of Amazon</li>
              <li> perform daily data backups on a separate server - backups are complete versions of production data
              </li>
              <li> use the Mongo DB Replica set which renders higher availability, retrieval performance, reliability,
                vertical and horizontal scalability, and very low "Recovery Time Objective" </li>
              <li> can extend the number of servers to handle the higher load without any interruption </li>
            </ul>
            <p> CN is hosted on thoroughly firewalled servers which automatically disable any unsupported device that
              tries to access them; the servers are carefully configured to allow access&nbsp;only&nbsp;to known
              services. Our data centers are only accessible by our internal servers, and no external access is granted.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Integrity and Disaster Recovery</h3>
            <p> CN is designed and meticulously built for&nbsp;High Availability and 99.9999% uptime. We conduct user
              data backups daily. However, having access to multiple duplicate servers reduce the risk of data loss
              (close to zero). Essential data and data with the highest usage rates are delivered to users worldwide
              using CDN to reduce the propagation delay. In addition to providing higher performance and availability,
              redundant data centers decrease the disaster recovery time (to zero). Therefore, if one or more servers
              fail, there are backup servers that can replace them immediately, without interruption.&nbsp; </p>
            <h3>Data Breach</h3>
            <p> We look for our service providers to provide us timely notification of breaches. If a security breach
              occurs, we will work with our clients and end-users to notify them promptly.&nbsp;If a data breach should
              occur, the GDPR specifies that we must provide adequate notification. The affected company has 72 hours to
              notify the appropriate data protection agency and must inform affected individuals “without undue delay.”
            </p>
            <h2>Terms of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h2>
            <p> Your use of the Site and any disputes arising from it is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our
              Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages,
              and choice of law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time and will provide notice
