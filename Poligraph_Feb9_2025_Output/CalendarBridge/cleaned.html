any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. </b></p><p>Remember that your use of CalendarBridges Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send a detailed message to privacy@calendarbridge.com and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-1" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span><h3><b>Overview</b></h3><p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up your account, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</p><p>As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at info@calendarbridge.com.</p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span><h3><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></h3><p>As our services or the law change, we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on calendarbridge.com, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span><h3><b>Information that CalendarBridge Collects</b></h3><p><em>Information You Provide to Us. </em> We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we may receive or collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, and Connected Account credentials (although for many third-party services that support the OAuth protocol, CalendarBridge does not store or see those credentials. This includes, for example, Microsoft and Google accounts when using “Sign in with Google” and “Sign in with Microsoft” features). If you provide your Connected Account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those Connected Accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted to us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, your list of contacts and calendar information. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p><p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by using the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our emails.</p><p><em>Information Collected Automatically. </em> Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p><p>If you click on a link to a third-party website or service, a third-party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p><p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span><h3><b>Sharing of Personal Information</b></h3><p>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p><p><em>Information that’s been de-identified. </em>We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p><p><em>Affiliated Businesses. </em> In certain situations, businesses or third-party websites we’re affiliated with may provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third-party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p><p><em>Agents. </em>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered a “partner” in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of the “Information that’s been de-identified” section in that regard.</p><p><em>User Profiles and Submissions. </em>Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content relating to the Connected Account that you use in connection with the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services.</p><p><em>Business Transfers. </em> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p><p><em>Protection of CalendarBridge and Others. </em> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of CalendarBridge, our employees, our users, or others.</p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-5" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span><h3><b>Security of Personal Information</b></h3><p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access the Services via a third-party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third-party site or service.

That said, you are probably at this page seeking the answer to one of two questions:</p><p><strong>What does CalendarBridge do with your calendar data?</strong></p><p><em>The only thing we do with your calendar data is copy it between your calendars as instructed by the configuration of your syncs. We do not store or share any information about the content of your calendars. We only store unique identifiers for calendar events so that we can retrieve them from Google and Microsoft and keep track of what events are copies, etc. The exception to this is if you use the scheduling service. Specifically, when someone books an appointment via a scheduling link, an email is sent to you with the details they entered. Those emails are stored on the server of our email sending service (currently Postmark).</em></p><p><strong>What is the renewal/cancellation/refund policy?</strong></p><p><span style="text-align: var(--text-align); color: var(--color-text); font-family: var(--e-global-typography-text-font-family); font-weight: var(--e-global-typography-text-font-weight);">All subscriptions automatically renew if you do not cancel them.&nbsp; We will send you a reminder a few days before the renewal.

If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-17" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span><h3><b>Changes to the Services</b></h3><p>We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-18" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span><h3><b>Billing</b></h3><p>Certain portions of the Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for other portions or all Services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. If you choose to upgrade to a paid version of the Services, then you will pay the applicable fees set forth during the subscription process. The subscription fee for the paid version (the “Subscription Fee”) will be charged to you in advance, to the credit card you provided during the subscription process.</p><p>You may cancel a subscription at any time to prevent the subscription from renewing at the end of the then-current billing cycle. Subscription Fees are non-refundable.</p><p>Your subscription will automatically renew in accordance with the billing plan that you selected. CalendarBridge may change the Subscription Fee upon notice to you, but such change will only take effect once your then-current subscription term has ended. If you do not wish to pay the new Subscription Fee, your only remedy shall be to cancel or downgrade your subscription.</p><p>CalendarBridge is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. CalendarBridge has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p><p>Termination of your account may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account or remove access to your Connected Account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your access to the Services so that you are able to retrieve any important Service Data (e.g. scheduling preferences) (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of CalendarBridge.</p><p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-19" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span><h3><b>Other Terms</b></h3><p><em>Warranty Disclaimer. </em> Neither CalendarBridge nor its licensors or suppliers makes any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services.
