Throughout Zoconut's Privacy Policy you will be able to check what rights you have at your disposal, what data we treat and with whom we share it, the period for which the personal data will be stored, and much more. We made sure that this Policy is as transparent, clear and concise as possible. It is important that you read it carefully and calmly since the privacy we guarantee is only as complete as your knowledge of it. We also recommend the full reading of the Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, also known as the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter GDPR), where you can learn more on privacy and protection of personal data.</p><h2>Who are we?</h2><p>Zoconut Pvt Ltd (hereinafter, ‚ÄúZoconut‚Äù), dedicates itself to the development of software, namely in the health area, being, in particular, the company responsible for the creation and development of the Zoconut software, in its various aspects. Aimed at Nutrition Clinics and Professionals, Zoconut, enables the simplification of complex tasks such as planning, analysis and creation of food plans, nutritional measurements and calculations, information management and analysis, and much more. Zoconut is, therefore, the entity that manages the processing of personal data collected through the Zoconut software, acting, mainly, as processor of the Professional, pursuant to the GDPR.</p><h2>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h2><p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the website <a href="https://zoconut.com/?">Zoconut.com</a> and its subdomains, whether or not they register, to all users of the mobile application, from the moment they install it on their device mobile, to all users of the platform who register for the trial period as well as for all those who actually contract our services after the trial period ends. The application of this Privacy Policy is irrelevant to the territorial scope, applying to all users from the moment they open our website or our mobile application, no matter where they are located. The use of the services provided by Zoconut is conditioned by the acceptance of the Terms and Conditions of Use and the reading of this Policy. In the event that you do not agree to these stipulations, please do not use our services.</p><h2>What data do we collect?</h2><p>The collection and processing of data is fundamental to the operation of Zoconut. It's based on that data that our project is built and it's that informational core that allows us to provide you with a service in the area of nutrition and patient management that is known for its excellence. We have reviewed and limited the data collection and the period of retention of the data to the minimum necessary. There are various sets of information and data that we collect and process. To simplify, we‚Äôll be dividing those sets of information in three large groups: Professionals, Patients and Secretaries.</p><h6>Professionals‚Äô data</h6><ul role="list"><li>Data required from the Professional upon registration: all data entered by the Professional when registering on the platform is stored and processed. It is this registry that allows us to identify the Professional and give him access to the reserved area of query management as well as correctly connect him to the patients that he inserts. In addition, this is the data we deem indispensable, together with the billing data, so that the contractual relationship between Zoconut and the Professional is carried out regularly. The data we require when registering is: the full name, the name of the primary place of work, the gender, country of residence, email and, of course, a password. In addition to these, all data voluntarily inserted by the Professionals during their use of the software is processed.</li><li>Payment data: the payment data of your monthly payment are also processed by Zoconut, although for this purpose a processor is used. Only then can we debit the amounts associated with the monthly payment you have chosen. The data required for this purpose is: a credit or debit card number, an expiration date and a security code.</li><li>Billing data: in order to comply with our tax obligations, we must ask you for some billing information such as: name, tax number, address, city, postal code and country.</li><li>Automatically collected data:in addition to the data mentioned above, we also automatically collect, through cookies and other methods and services, a set of data that allows us to know precisely how you use the platform, the country, the date and time of the login, among other information. In addition to this information we also collected other data such as the I.P. address, the browser you use to access and its version, the language, your device operating system, among others. We would like to emphasize that this type of data collection is mainly intended to facilitate the work of our team whenever you need our support. It‚Äôs the collection of these groups of information that allows the quick resolution of problems on our platforms, without it we wouldn‚Äôt be able to guarantee the normal operation of our service and its maintenance. For more information please check our section on how we disclose and share data with third parties (subprocessors) and our cookie policy.</li></ul><h4>Patients‚Äô data</h4><p>Patients‚Äô data is directly collected, for the most part, by the Professional. He is the controller and the main responsible for the processing of the patients‚Äô personal data. Having said that, besides a minimum set of legally required measures, Zoconut is not responsible for providing the information and guarantees imposed by the GDPR on the Professionals in regard to their relationship with the Patient.</p><p>A series of personal data might be requested by the Professional to the Patient, or recorded by observation, which may range from ‚Äúsimple‚Äù personal data categories (such as: billing data, user identification number, among others, such as name complete, address, cell phone, and many more) to data considered as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù (examples of this type of data include race, personal and social history, clinical history, food history, body measurements, among other information).</p><p>Zoconut only treats Patient data as it is entered by the Professional, or directly through the mobile application. The use of the mobile application is intended for use by patients and is, of course, optional and, in cases where it is used, we collect the following data:</p><ul role="list"><li>Data entered by the patient: all data entered by the Patient, be it when logging in into the mobile application or posteriorly, is stored and processed. It‚Äôs this set of data that allows us to identify the Patient, to give him access to their reserved area, to associate them correctly with the Professional who advised them and to give them access to their plans. Examples of such data include login credentials, but also other data such as the amount of water ingested, weight, and other information.</li><li>Location data: with the use of the mobile application we may access information contained in the GPS of your mobile device. However, this operation is optional and must always be previously consented by the user.</li><li>Local files, notifications and other data:on certain occasions the mobile application may access, with the Patient prior consent and by their order, to local files or information stored in other applications. All these operations are optional, serving only as a way of complementing and enhancing the usefulness of the service we provide. Get to know some of the features of our application:</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Notifications:for the convenience of the Patient, the Zoconut application will send notifications about their food plans, amounts of water, messages and appointments. These notifications are daily updated, automatically. This feature can be disabled at any time in the application settings.</li><li>Health Apps:at the Patient's request the Zoconut application may connect to other health applications such as Apple Health. In these cases, data on physical activity, namely, steps, distance and active calories will be collected.</li><li>Camera and Gallery:at the Patient‚Äôs request, the application can access the camera and the image gallery of the mobile device, allowing the Patient to take pictures and send them through message to their Professional or send images already stored in the gallery.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Automatically collected data:in addition to the data mentioned above, we also automatically collect, through cookies and other methods and services, a set of data that allows us to know precisely how you use the platform, the country, the date and time of the login, among other information. In addition to this information we also collected other data such as the I.P. address, the browser you use to access and its version, the language, your device operating system, among others. We would like to emphasize that this type of data collection is mainly intended to facilitate the work of our team whenever you need our support. It‚Äôs the collection of these groups of information that allows the quick resolution of problems on our platforms, without it we wouldn‚Äôt be able to guarantee the normal operation of our service and its maintenance. For more information please check our section on how we disclose and share data with third parties (subprocessors) and our cookie policy.</li></ul><h4>Account Deletion</h4><p>According to HIPAA, the covered Entity and Business Associate are bound by state law with regards to how long medical records have to be retained. And Hence the data deletion will be manual by the practitioner only after taking the client‚Äôs consent. Contact <a href="mailto:help@zoconut.com?" target="_blank"><strong>help@zoconut.com</strong></a> for a deletion request.<br>Clients can not delete medical records from the system.</p><h4>Secretaries‚Äô data</h4><p>Like the Patients‚Äô data, Secretaries‚Äô data is also directly collected, for the most part, by the Professional. He is the controller and the main responsible for the processing of the Secretaries' personal data, and may lack consent in the context of their contractual relations to which Zoconut is unrelated.</p><p>However, when using the platform, and in addition to the treatment performed on the data entered directly by the Professional, Zoconut also collects some data which was already listed in relation to the Professional as "Automatically collected data", and so, we ask you to check this section.</p><h2>Purposes of the processing</h2><p>We use the data we collect for a series of purposes that we want to make known. Those purposes may be based on a legal obligation, the legitimate interests of Zoconut, the performance of the contract or consent, depending on the case.</p><ul role="list"><li>Provision of our service: we use the vast majority of the data entered, either by Professionals or Patients, so that we can provide our service as efficiently as possible within the contractual relationship established between Zoconut and the Professional.</li><li>Maintenance and improvement of services:we conduct behavioral analysis of the use made by the Professionals and by the Patients of the website and the mobile application. It is fundamentally this type of analysis that allows us to determine the usefulness of certain functionalities and change or correct them depending on the result. In addition, we may use your non-anonymized data in the context of the communication of a bug or error in the software by the user and always with the purpose of solving it. We can also, for example, at the request of the user, copy data between accounts.</li><li>Customer support:it is essential for the quality of our service that we can answer efficiently to all the questions you ask us, using for that purpose any personal data that we deem necessary for the contact and resolution of the question that may arise, which may be, depending on the case, your full name, your email, your mobile phone number or your address, among other information. In addition to this data and with the same purpose, we may collect usage statistics of our platforms.</li><li>Billing:it would be impossible for us to comply with our legal and tax obligations if we did not address the processing of some billing information. It is only for this purpose that we collect, at the time of payment, personal data such as the tax identification number, among others already listed above.</li><li>Legal matters:we may use your personal data to comply with court orders and tax and administrative inspections, among other legal requirements. In the eventuality of a court order, all personal data, be it from a simple or special category, of the Professionals‚Äô or Patients‚Äô, may be, if our legal team agrees with the legal basis of the warrant, made available in full to the administrative or judicial authority in question.</li><li>Marketing:we may use your data to send you emails, notifications, text messages and postal mail. We will never do it, however, without your express authorization and you can freely choose not to subscribe and continue enjoying the rest of our services. In order to provide you with a tailor-made experience, the processing of such communications may be subject to automated individual decision-making, including profiling.</li><li>Security and contractual purposes:we use your data to perform behavior analysis in order to prevent or address suspicious or fraudulent conducts and to ensure that the contractual relationship between Zoconut and the Professional is timely met.</li></ul><h2>Data retention period</h2><p>Personal data may be retained for different periods of time depending on its legal relevance or the duration of the contractual relationship.</p><h2>Subprocessors</h2><p>Some of your personal data may be processed by third parties who are not part of our services. We have limited these operations to the bare minimum we need to continue to operate efficiently.
