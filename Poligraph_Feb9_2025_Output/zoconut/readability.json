Aimed at Nutrition Clinics and Professionals, Zoconut, enables the simplification of complex tasks such as planning, analysis and creation of food plans, nutritional measurements and calculations, information management and analysis, and much more. Zoconut is, therefore, the entity that manages the processing of personal data collected through the Zoconut software, acting, mainly, as processor of the Professional, pursuant to the GDPR.</p><h2>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h2><p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the website <a href=\"https://zoconut.com/?\">Zoconut.com</a> and its subdomains, whether or not they register, to all users of the mobile application, from the moment they install it on their device mobile, to all users of the platform who register for the trial period as well as for all those who actually contract our services after the trial period ends. The application of this Privacy Policy is irrelevant to the territorial scope, applying to all users from the moment they open our website or our mobile application, no matter where they are located. The use of the services provided by Zoconut is conditioned by the acceptance of the Terms and Conditions of Use and the reading of this Policy. In the event that you do not agree to these stipulations, please do not use our services.</p><h2>What data do we collect?</h2><p>The collection and processing of data is fundamental to the operation of Zoconut. It's based on that data that our project is built and it's that informational core that allows us to provide you with a service in the area of nutrition and patient management that is known for its excellence. We have reviewed and limited the data collection and the period of retention of the data to the minimum necessary. There are various sets of information and data that we collect and process. To simplify, we\u2019ll be dividing those sets of information in three large groups: Professionals, Patients and Secretaries.</p><h6>Professionals\u2019 data</h6><ul role=\"list\"><li>Data required from the Professional upon registration: all data entered by the Professional when registering on the platform is stored and processed. It is this registry that allows us to identify the Professional and give him access to the reserved area of query management as well as correctly connect him to the patients that he inserts. In addition, this is the data we deem indispensable, together with the billing data, so that the contractual relationship between Zoconut and the Professional is carried out regularly. The data we require when registering is: the full name, the name of the primary place of work, the gender, country of residence, email and, of course, a password. In addition to these, all data voluntarily inserted by the Professionals during their use of the software is processed.</li><li>Payment data: the payment data of your monthly payment are also processed by Zoconut, although for this purpose a processor is used. Only then can we debit the amounts associated with the monthly payment you have chosen. The data required for this purpose is: a credit or debit card number, an expiration date and a security code.</li><li>Billing data: in order to comply with our tax obligations, we must ask you for some billing information such as: name, tax number, address, city, postal code and country.</li><li>Automatically collected data:in addition to the data mentioned above, we also automatically collect, through cookies and other methods and services, a set of data that allows us to know precisely how you use the platform, the country, the date and time of the login, among other information. In addition to this information we also collected other data such as the I.P. address, the browser you use to access and its version, the language, your device operating system, among others. We would like to emphasize that this type of data collection is mainly intended to facilitate the work of our team whenever you need our support. It\u2019s the collection of these groups of information that allows the quick resolution of problems on our platforms, without it we wouldn\u2019t be able to guarantee the normal operation of our service and its maintenance. For more information please check our section on how we disclose and share data with third parties (subprocessors) and our cookie policy.</li></ul><h4>Patients\u2019 data</h4><p>Patients\u2019 data is directly collected, for the most part, by the Professional. He is the controller and the main responsible for the processing of the patients\u2019 personal data. Having said that, besides a minimum set of legally required measures, Zoconut is not responsible for providing the information and guarantees imposed by the GDPR on the Professionals in regard to their relationship with the Patient.</p><p>A series of personal data might be requested by the Professional to the Patient, or recorded by observation, which may range from \u201csimple\u201d personal data categories (such as: billing data, user identification number, among others, such as name complete, address, cell phone, and many more) to data considered as \u201cspecial\u201d (examples of this type of data include race, personal and social history, clinical history, food history, body measurements, among other information).</p><p>Zoconut only treats Patient data as it is entered by the Professional, or directly through the mobile application. The use of the mobile application is intended for use by patients and is, of course, optional and, in cases where it is used, we collect the following data:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Data entered by the patient: all data entered by the Patient, be it when logging in into the mobile application or posteriorly, is stored and processed. It\u2019s this set of data that allows us to identify the Patient, to give him access to their reserved area, to associate them correctly with the Professional who advised them and to give them access to their plans. Examples of such data include login credentials, but also other data such as the amount of water ingested, weight, and other information.</li><li>Location data: with the use of the mobile application we may access information contained in the GPS of your mobile device. However, this operation is optional and must always be previously consented by the user.</li><li>Local files, notifications and other data:on certain occasions the mobile application may access, with the Patient prior consent and by their order, to local files or information stored in other applications. All these operations are optional, serving only as a way of complementing and enhancing the usefulness of the service we provide. Get to know some of the features of our application:</li></ul><ul role=\"list\"><li>Notifications:for the convenience of the Patient, the Zoconut application will send notifications about their food plans, amounts of water, messages and appointments. These notifications are daily updated, automatically. This feature can be disabled at any time in the application settings.</li><li>Health Apps:at the Patient's request the Zoconut application may connect to other health applications such as Apple Health. In these cases, data on physical activity, namely, steps, distance and active calories will be collected.</li><li>Camera and Gallery:at the Patient\u2019s request, the application can access the camera and the image gallery of the mobile device, allowing the Patient to take pictures and send them through message to their Professional or send images already stored in the gallery.</li></ul><ul role=\"list\"><li>Automatically collected data:in addition to the data mentioned above, we also automatically collect, through cookies and other methods and services, a set of data that allows us to know precisely how you use the platform, the country, the date and time of the login, among other information.

Contact <a href=\"mailto:help@zoconut.com?\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>help@zoconut.com</strong></a> for a deletion request.<br>Clients can not delete medical records from the system.</p><h4>Secretaries\u2019 data</h4><p>Like the Patients\u2019 data, Secretaries\u2019 data is also directly collected, for the most part, by the Professional. He is the controller and the main responsible for the processing of the Secretaries' personal data, and may lack consent in the context of their contractual relations to which Zoconut is unrelated.</p><p>However, when using the platform, and in addition to the treatment performed on the data entered directly by the Professional, Zoconut also collects some data which was already listed in relation to the Professional as \"Automatically collected data\", and so, we ask you to check this section.</p><h2>Purposes of the processing</h2><p>We use the data we collect for a series of purposes that we want to make known.
