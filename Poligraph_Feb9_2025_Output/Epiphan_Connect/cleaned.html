				<h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>To collect the information in the “Information we collect through automated means” section above, Epiphan and our service providers use web server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An SDK is a set of tools and/or code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Services.</li>
<li>Cookies are small text files that are installed on your browser, your computer or on your mobile device.&nbsp;&nbsp;Functional cookies are used by Epiphan to record a user’s choice and settings that enable our Services to operate correctly or that maintain your preferences over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertising cookies are used to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you. Analytical cookies gather usage and performance data that help Epiphan improve our Services.&nbsp; Social sharing cookies and code snippets are provided by social media companies that enables Epiphan content to be used with other social media company web content.&nbsp;&nbsp;Service cookies are performance cookies for load balancing to ensure that websites and Products remain up and operating.</li>

				<h2>5. Online Analytics and Interest-Based Advertisements</h2>
<p><strong>Online analytics.&nbsp;</strong>We may use third-party analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar technologies; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Interest-based advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When you use the Services, we may display advertising to you about our products, services, and related feature that we think may be of interest to you. We partner with third parties to market our services to you on third party sites. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, your searches, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>Some of our third-party partners use technologies such as cookies and other technologies to gather information about your activities on this website, our affiliates’ websites, and unaffiliated websites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, and others) may also serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.&nbsp; We sometimes provide a hashed or encrypted version of your information such as your email address to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. &nbsp;If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">Your Online Choices</a>&nbsp;to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. &nbsp;To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">Google Ads Settings page</a>. &nbsp;We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. &nbsp;We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p>
<p><strong>Notice concerning Do Not Track.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.&nbsp; We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide our users with the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above.&nbsp; Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.

				<h2>6. Sharing Your Information</h2>
<p>We will share your information collected from and about you in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>At your or your organization’s direction</strong>. We may share information with third parties when you or your organization directs us to do so, such as when you use the Services to capture content or share content created via the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Service providers.&nbsp;</strong>We may share information collected with select third parties who use the information to provide services on our behalf, such as Services operation, data processing orders, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration, providing customer support, analytics and online advertising, security, fraud prevention, and legal services.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliates and subsidiaries.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We may share information we collect within the Epiphan family to deliver products and services to you, ensure a consistent level of service, and enhance our products, services, and your customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Other users of the Services</strong>. To the extent that you post content in publicly-accessible parts of the Services, or choose to make certain of your content viewable by other users, such content can be read, collected, and used by others with permission to view it.</p>
<p><strong>Business transfers</strong>. In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. &nbsp;In these types of transactions, Customer information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.</p>
<p><strong>Comply with laws and protect our rights and the rights of others.&nbsp;</strong>As required by law, we may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or similar legal process by disclosing your information, if necessary. We also may use your information to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>

				<h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
<p>You have certain rights with respect to your information as further described in this section, in addition to any rights discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;Please note your rights and choices vary depending upon your location.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing communications.&nbsp;</strong>You can instruct us not to use your information to contact you by email, postal mail, or by phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us using the information below. &nbsp;In commercial email messages, you can also update your preferences by using the “Unsubscribe” link found in such emails. &nbsp;Removing your name from the email list may take a reasonable amount of time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law.&nbsp; For example, you may not opt out of certain operational emails, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying the Data Controller and Processor</strong>. Data protection laws in certain jurisdictions differentiate between the “controller” and “processor” of information. &nbsp;In general, Customer is the controller of Customer Data, and Epiphan is the processor of Customer Data and the controller of account information, usage information (including, internet or other network or device activity, Services metadata, log data, location information), cookie information, and other information provided to Epiphan (collectively, “Other Information”).</p>
<p><strong>International.&nbsp;</strong>When Epiphan acts as a controller, individuals in the EEA, the UK, Switzerland, and some other jurisdictions have certain additional legal rights to do the following with personal information we handle:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access:&nbsp;</strong>You can request more information about the information we hold about you.</li>
<li><strong>Rectification:&nbsp;</strong>If you believe that personal information we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data. You can also correct some of this information directly by logging into your service account. Please contact us as soon as possible upon noticing any such inaccuracy or incompleteness at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@epiphan.com">info@epiphan.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Objection:&nbsp;</strong>You can contact us to let us know that you object to the collection or use of your personal information for certain purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Erasure:&nbsp;</strong>You can request that we erase some or all of your personal information from our systems.</li>
<li><strong>Restriction of Processing:&nbsp;</strong>You can ask us to restrict further processing of your personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Portability:&nbsp;</strong>You have the right to ask for a copy of your in a machine-readable format. You can also request that we transmit the data to another entity where technically feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:&nbsp;</strong>If we are processing your personal information based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your personal information, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals whose personal information is subject to the GDPR also have a right to opt out of our handling of their personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Many of the rights described above are subject to limitations or exceptions under applicable law.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, or raise a complaint on how we have handled your personal information, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@epiphan.com">privacy@epiphan.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you are seeking to exercise applicable rights with respect to information that we handle solely on behalf of a Customer, you should direct requests to that Customer directly.</p>
<p>Individuals also have a right to file a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority, but we invite you to kindly first give us an opportunity to address your concern.</p>

<p>We also may share any of the categories of personal information we collect as set forth in the “Sharing Your Information” section of this Policy, including with governmental entities for legal purposes and our affiliates and subsidiaries.</p>
<p><strong>Sale of personal information</strong>.&nbsp; The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information. Based on the definition of “sell” under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months. We do share certain information as set forth in the “Sharing Your Information” section of this Policy and allow third parties to collect certain information about your activity, for example through cookies, as explained in the “Collection of Information,” “Cookies and Tracking Technologies,” and “Online Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising” sections of this Privacy Policy, but we do not believe such sharing constitutes a “sale” under the CCPA.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How we use these categories of personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We and our service providers may use the categories of personal information we collect from and about you for the business purposes listed in the “Use of Your Information” section above.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Additional California privacy rights</strong>.&nbsp; California law may also permit you to request that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.</li>
<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li>
<li>Delete certain information we have about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any). You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services to you and for compliance with applicable law. If you ask us to delete certain information, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.</p>
<p>If would like to exercise any of these rights, please use our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epiphan.com/policies/privacy-policy/#gform_75">online web form</a>&nbsp;or contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@epiphan.com">privacy@epiphan.com</a></p>
<p>You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request, which may include, at a minimum, verifying your name and email address. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. &nbsp;To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. &nbsp;You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p>
<p><strong>Shine the Light disclosure.&nbsp;</strong>The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of “personal information” (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. &nbsp; We do not share your “personal information” with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
