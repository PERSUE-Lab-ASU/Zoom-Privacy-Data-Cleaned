We will make every effort to respond to requests of this type immediately.\n\n\n6.3 The Right to Erasure\n\n\nOtherwise known as the \u2018right to be forgotten, this gives you the right to request your personal data be deleted.\n\nThis is not an absolute right; if you were to request that we erase your personal data, we would erase as much of that data as possible but may have to retain some information if necessary.\n\nSuppose we have received a request for personal data to be erased. In that case, if it is necessary for us to retain some of that information, we shall ensure that the remaining data is used only when and where it is essential.\n\n\n6.4 The Right to Objection\n\n\nThe right to object is the fundamental freedom all democracies enjoy.
