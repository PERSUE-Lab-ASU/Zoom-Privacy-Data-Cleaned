The legality of the data processing carried out up to the time of revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p><p><strong>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)</strong></p><p>If the data processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter e or f GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. You will find the respective legal basis on which processing is based in this Data Protection Declaration.

You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from \u201chttp://\u201d to \u201chttps://\u201d and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p><p>With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p><p>Information, blocking, deletion and correction</p><p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to obtain information free of charge at any time about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correct, block or delete this data.

For the duration of the review, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.<br>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need them to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.<br>If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 Paragraph 1 DSGVO, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests outweigh the interests of the other parties, you have the right to demand that the processing of your personal data be restricted.<br>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data \u2013 apart from their storage \u2013 may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p><p>Objection to advertising e-mails</p><p>The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation for the transmission of not expressly requested advertising and information material is hereby contradicted. The operators of the website expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam e-mails.</p><p>3. data collection on our website</p><p>Cookies</p><p>Data protection notice (DSGVO)</p><p>We use cookies to optimize this website.

The website operator has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user behaviour in order to optimise both his website and his advertising.</p><p>IP Anonymisation</p><p>We have activated the IP anonymization function on this website. As a result, your IP address is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before it is transmitted to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services to the website operator in connection with the use of the website and the Internet.

This allows us to generate reports that contain information about the age, gender and interests of the site visitors. This data is derived from interest-based advertising by Google as well as from visitor data from third parties. This data cannot be assigned to a specific person. You can disable this feature at any time in the ad settings in your Google Account or generally prohibit Google Analytics from collecting your information as described in the \u201cOpting out of data collection\u201d section.</p><p>Google Analytics Remarketing</p><p>Our websites use the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing in conjunction with the cross-device functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p><p>This feature allows you to link the advertising audiences created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to you on one device (e.g. mobile phone) depending on your previous usage and surfing behavior can also be displayed on another of your devices (e.g. tablet or PC).</p><p>If you have given us permission, Google will link your web and app browsing history to your Google Account for this purpose.

For data collection operations that are not merged into your Google Account (e.g. because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merging), the collection of data is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter f of the DPA. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that the website operator has an interest in the anonymised analysis of website visitors for advertising purposes.</p><p>Further information and the data protection regulations can be found in the Google data protection declaration at: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.</p><p>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</p><p>This website uses Google AdWords.

If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not expired, Google and we may recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to that page.</p><p>Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The cookies cannot be tracked across the websites of AdWords customers.

Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users.
