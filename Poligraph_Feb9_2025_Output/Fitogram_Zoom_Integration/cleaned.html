<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>



<p>The following information provides a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit our website. Personal data is any information with which you can be personally identified. For more detailed information on the subject of data protection, please refer to our privacy policy described below this text.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>1. <strong>General Information and Mandatory Information</strong></li>
</ol>



<p><strong>1.1 Privacy Policy</strong></p>



<p>Fitogram GmbH takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. We handle your personal data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>



<p>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is information with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains which information we collect and how we use it. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>



<p>We wish to point out that data transfer via the internet (e.g. email communication) may be subject to security holes. A complete protection of the data against third-party access is not possible.</p>



<p><strong>1.2 Information on the Responsible Body</strong></p>



<p>The responsible body is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, email addresses, etc.).</p>



<p>The responsible body for the collection, processing and use of your personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR is Fitogram GmbH (hereinafter also referred to as “we” or “Fitogram”). You can contact us as follows:</p>



<p><strong>Fitogram GmbH</strong><br>Probsteigasse 15-17<br>50670 Cologne</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2">
<li><strong>2. Processing Security Measures in accordance with Article 32 GDPR</strong></li>
</ol>



<p><strong>2.1 SSL and TLS Encryption</strong></p>



<p>This site uses SSL and TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transfer of confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site operator. An encrypted connection can be recognised by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>



<p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data which you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>



<p><strong>2.2 Encrypted Payment Transactions on this Website</strong></p>



<p>If, after the conclusion of a fee-based contract, there is an obligation to provide us with your payment details (e.g. account number for direct debit authorisation), this data is required for payment processing.</p>



<p>Payment transactions via the usual means of payment (Visa/MasterCard, direct debit) are carried out exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. An encrypted connection can be recognised by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>



<p>With encrypted communication, payment details which you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="3">
<li><strong>3. Collection, Processing and Use of Personal Data</strong></li>
</ol>



<p><strong>3.1 Personal Data</strong></p>



<p>Personal data includes individual details about the personal or factual circumstances of a specific or identifiable natural person. These are, for example, your name, email address or postal address.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="4">
<li><strong>4. Data Collection on our Website</strong>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>4.1. Contact Form</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>



<p>If you send us an enquiry via the contact form, the details which you provided in the contact form, including the contact details you listed there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the event of follow-up questions. This data will not be passed on without your consent.</p>



<p>The processing of the data entered in the contact form is therefore carried out exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke this consent at any time. An email notification to us is sufficient for this purpose. The legality of the data processing operations carried out up until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>



<p>The data entered by you in the contact form will remain with us until you request its deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose of storing your data no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="5">
<li><strong>4.2. Registration on this Website</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>You can register on our website in order to use additional features on the site. We only use the data entered by you for the purpose of using the respective offer or service for which you have registered. The mandatory information requested during registration must be provided in full. Otherwise we will refuse the registration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the event of important changes, for example in the scope of our services or in the event of necessary technical changes, we will use the email address provided during registration to inform you in this way.</p>



<p>The data entered during registration will be processed on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email notification to us is sufficient for this purpose. The legality of the data processing already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data collected during registration will be stored by us for as long as you are registered on our website and will then subsequently be deleted. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="5">
<li><strong>4.3.</strong> <strong>Processing of Data (Customer and Contract Data)</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>We collect, process and use personal data only to the extent necessary for the establishment, content-related design or modification of the legal relationship (inventory data). This is done on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract or pre-contractual measures. We collect, process and use personal data relating to the use of our internet pages (usage data) only to the extent necessary to enable the user to make use of the service or to bill the user.</p>



<p>The collected customer data will be deleted after completion of the contract or termination of the business relationship. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="5">
<li><strong>4.4. Data Transfer upon Conclusion of Contract for Services and Digital Content</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>We transfer personal data to third parties only if this is necessary in the context of contract processing, for example to the bank responsible for processing the payment.</p>



<p>A further transfer of data does not take place or only takes place if you have expressly agreed to the transfer. Your data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent, for example for advertising purposes.</p>



<p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="5">
<li><strong>4.5. Newsletter Data</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>If you wish to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the email address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter. Further data will not be collected or will only be collected on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively to send the requested information and do not pass this on to third parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data entered in the newsletter registration form will be processed exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke your consent to the storage of data, email address and the use thereof to send the newsletter at any time, for example via the “Unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations that have already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data you have provided us with for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted after you cancel the newsletter. This does not affect data stored by us for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the member area).</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="5">
<li><strong>5. Data Transfer to Third Countries or International Organisations</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>We work together with various service providers. If a transfer to a third country is necessary, this will be carried out exclusively on the basis of contract data processing in accordance with Article 28 GDPR.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="6">
<li><strong>5.1.</strong> <strong>Mailchimp</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>This website uses the services of Mailchimp to send newsletters. The provider is Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.</p>



<p>Mailchimp is a service which can be used, among other things, to organise and analyse the sending of newsletters. If you enter data for newsletter subscription purposes (e.g. email address), it will be stored on Mailchimp’s servers in the USA.</p>



<p>Mailchimp is certified according to the “EU-US Privacy Shield”. The “Privacy Shield” is an agreement between the European Union (EU) and the USA which is intended to ensure compliance with European data protection standards in the USA.</p>



<p>Mailchimp enables us to analyse our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent with Mailchimp, a file contained in the email (known as a web beacon) connects to the Mailchimp servers in the USA. In this way, it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked. In addition, technical information (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type and operating system) is recorded. This information cannot be assigned to the respective newsletter recipient. It is simply used for the statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.</p>



<p>If you do not wish to be analysed by Mailchimp, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. We provide a corresponding link in every newsletter update for this purpose. You can also unsubscribe directly on the website.</p>



<p>Data processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke this consent at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations that have already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>



<p>The data you have provided us with for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from our servers as well as from the Mailchimp servers after unsubscribing from the newsletter. Data stored by us for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the member area) remain unaffected.</p>



<p>For more information, please refer to Mailchimp’s privacy statement at:&nbsp;<a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/</a>.</p>



<p>We have concluded a “Data Processing Agreement” with Mailchimp, in which we oblige Mailchimp to protect the data of our customers and not to pass it on to third parties. This agreement can be viewed at the following link: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/data-processing-addendum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://mailchimp.com/legal/data-processing-addendum/</a>.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="6">
<li><strong>6. Cookies</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The web pages sometimes use so-called cookies. Cookies do not damage your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our offer more user-friendly, more effective and more secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer by your browser.</p>



<p>Most of the cookies we use are known as “session cookies”. They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognise your browser during your next visit.</p>



<p>You can set your browser so that you are informed about the use of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, accept cookies in certain cases, or generally prevent the use of them and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are disabled, the functionality of this website may be restricted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cookies which are necessary for the execution of the electronic communication process or for the provision of certain functions desired by you (e.g. shopping basket function) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and optimised provision of its services. Insofar as other cookies (e.g. cookies for analysing your browsing behaviour) are stored, these are dealt with separately in this privacy policy.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="7">
<li><strong>7. Visiting our Website</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Your visit to our pages is stored in a log file (so-called server logfiles). This data is automatically recorded by our IT systems when you visit our website. This is mainly technical data (e.g. internet browser, operating system or the time the page was viewed). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="8">
<li><strong>8. Analytical Tools and Advertising</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>When you visit our website, information is collected which is used to statistically evaluate your browsing behaviour. This is done primarily with cookies and so-called analysis programs. The analysis of your browsing behaviour is usually anonymous; the browsing behaviour cannot be traced back to you. You can object to this analysis or prevent it by not using certain tools. More detailed information on this can be found in the following privacy policy.</p>



<p><strong>8.1 Use of Tracking Tools</strong></p>



<p>In connection with our web pages, we use technologies in order to be able to evaluate information on the type and extent of the use of our web pages (tracking tools).</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="9">
<li><strong>8.1.1. Google Analytics</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>This website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>



<p>Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”. These are text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will generally be transferred to and stored by Google on servers in the USA.</p>



<p>Google Analytics cookies are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour in order to optimise both its website and its advertising.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="9">
<li><strong>8.1.1.1. IP Anonymisation</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>We have activated the IP anonymisation function on this website. This will cause Google to shorten your IP address within member states of the European Union or other treaty states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before it is transferred to the USA. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the website operator, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transferred by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="9">
<li><strong>8.1.1.2. Browser Plugin</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) as well as from processing this data by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="9">
<li><strong>8.1.1.3. Opposition to Data Collection</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>You can prevent Google Analytics from collecting your data by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie is set to prevent your information from being collected on future visits to this website:&nbsp;Disable Google Analytics.</p>



<p>For more information on how Google Analytics handles user data, please refer to Google’s privacy policy:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de</a>.</p>



<p>We have concluded a contract with Google for contract data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="9">
<li><strong>8.1.2. Google Analytics Remarketing</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Our sites use Google Analytics Remarketing features in conjunction with the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>



<p>This feature allows Google Analytics Remarketing to link advertising target groups with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-related, personalised advertising messages which have been adapted to you depending on your previous usage and browsing behaviour on one device (e.g. mobile phone) can also be displayed on another of your devices (e.g. tablet or PC).</p>



<p>If you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browser history to your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalised advertising messages can be displayed on every device on which you log in with your Google account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated user IDs that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create target audiences for cross-device advertising.</p>



<p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by opting out of personalised advertising in your Google account using this link: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p>



<p>The data collected in your Google account will only be aggregated on the basis of your consent, which you may give to or revoke from Google (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). In the case of data collection processes that are not consolidated in your Google account (e.g. because you do not have a Google account or have objected to the consolidation), the data collection is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that the website operator has an interest in the anonymous analysis of website visitors for advertising purposes.</p>



<p>Further information and the privacy policy can be found in Google’s privacy statement at: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a>.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="9">
<li><strong>8.1.3. Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”).</p>



<p>As part of Google AdWords, we use what is known as conversion tracking. When you click on an ad placed by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files which the internet browser places on the user’s computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not expired, ourselves and Google may recognise that the user clicked on the ad and was directed to that page.</p>



<p>Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot be tracked through AdWords customer websites. The information collected from the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers will know the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were directed to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they will not receive information which personally identifies you. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can opt out of this use by easily disabling the Google conversion tracking cookie in your internet browser. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>



<p>Conversion cookies are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour in order to optimise both its website and its advertising.</p>



<p>More information on Google AdWords and Google conversion tracking can be found in Google’s privacy statement:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>



<p>You can set your browser so that you are informed about the use of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, accept cookies in certain cases, or generally prevent the use of them and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are disabled, the functionality of this website may be restricted.&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="9">
<li><strong>8.1.4. Facebook Pixel</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>To measure conversion, our website uses the visitor action pixel of Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”).</p>



<p>This enables us to track the behaviour of site visitors after they are redirected to the provider’s website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This allows the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements to be evaluated for statistical and market research purposes and to optimise future advertising efforts.</p>



<p>The data collected is anonymous to us as the operator of this website, and we cannot draw any conclusions about the identity of the users. However, data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Data Usage Guidelines</a>. This may allow Facebook to place ads on Facebook pages and outside of Facebook. This use of data cannot be influenced by us as the site operator.</p>



<p>See Facebook’s privacy notice for more information about protecting your privacy:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.</p>



<p>You can also disable the “Custom Audiences” remarketing function in the advertisement settings section at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen</a>. You must be logged in to Facebook to do so.</p>

</ol>



<p>To the extent necessary, we process your data beyond the fulfilment of a contract concluded with you or consent given by you to protect our legitimate interests or those of third parties, unless a consideration in individual cases shows that your legitimate fundamental rights and freedoms, which require the protection of personal data, prevail (cf.

<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ol>



<p>The collected customer data will be deleted following the completion of the contract or upon completion of the business relationship. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.</p>



<p>Such retention periods may result, for example, from the German Commercial Code (HGB) or German Fiscal Code (AO). The periods specified there for storage or documentation are up to ten years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the storage period is also assessed according to statutory limitation periods which, for example, according to Sections 195 et seq. of the German Civil Code (BGB), can generally be three years, but in certain cases may also be up to thirty years.</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list" start="13">

<p>You also have the right to have incorrect personal data corrected in accordance with Art. 16 GDPR as well as have your personal data deleted in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR.</p>

<li><strong>12.4. Processing Restrictions</strong></li>

In the event of such an objection, we will no longer process such data unless we can prove that there are compelling reasons for the processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the assertion, exercise of defence of legal claims.&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="13">
<li><strong>12.6</strong>. <strong>Release of Data and Data Transfer</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Furthermore, you have the right to receive a copy of the personal data which you provided us with in a structured, common and machine-readable format.

The right to transfer data to another responsible party is excluded if this would affect the rights and freedoms of other persons (e.g. personal data of third parties, our business and company secrets or copyrights).</p>



<p>The assertion of the aforementioned rights is generally free of charge for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in the event of manifestly unfounded or – in particular in the case of frequent repetition – excessive claims, we may, in accordance with Art. 12 Para. 5 GDPR, either demand an appropriate fee which takes into account the administrative costs of the information or notification or implementation of the requested measure or refuse to act on the basis of the claim.</p>
