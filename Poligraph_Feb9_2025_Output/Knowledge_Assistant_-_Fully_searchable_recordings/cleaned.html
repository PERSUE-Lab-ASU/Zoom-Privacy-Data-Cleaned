        <div class="row" style="padding: 0;position: relative;"><div class="wrapper"><div class="divider div-transparent div-dot"></div></div></div>

        <h2><strong>5. Our Compliance with Data privacy protection Statues:</strong></h2>
        <p class="normal">5.1 We understand that Users who are under 13 years of age (“Children”) need special safeguards and privacy protection, and it is the intent of the Company to fully comply with, though not limited to, COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), the California Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and all other applicable state or federal student data privacy protection laws. Company does not collect personal information directly from children online at any point. Company only receives personal information about children directly from school administrators and/or teachers or parents when they set up Student accounts. Parents or legal guardians should contact their child’s school to review any personal information regarding their children that the school’s administrators or teachers have provided to the Company.
        </p>
        <p class="normal">5.2 COPPA permits a school, acting in the role of “parent,” to provide required consent regarding the Personal Information of students who are under the age of 13. Where a school is a subscriber to our Products, we rely on this form of COPPA consent. We provide the school with this Policy, to ensure that the school, in providing its COPPA consent, has full information and assurance that our practices comply with COPPA. </p>
        <p class="normal">5.3 FERPA permits a school to provide educational records (including those that contain students’ Personal Information) to certain service providers without requiring the school to obtain specific parental consent. FERPA permits this where the service provider acts as a type of “school official” by performing services, for example, that would otherwise be performed by the school’s own employees. We fulfill FERPA requirements for qualifying as a school official by, among other steps, giving the school direct control with respect to the use and maintenance of the education records at issue (including associated personal information), and refraining from re-disclosing or using this Personal Information except for purposes of providing our Products to the school. We comply with FERPA by relying on this form of consent. </p>
        <p class="normal">5.4 If you are an educator or a School Administrator and you add a student who is under 13 to your class within the Lumos Learning Online Program, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with the COPPA, FERPA and SOPIPA guidelines, including, but not limited to, obtaining parental consent concerning collection of students’ personal information used in connection with the provisioning and use of Lumos Learning Online Program. </p>
        <p class="normal">5.5 SOPIPA permits use of student information only for educational purposes, thereby Lumos Learning is committed to protect the privacy and security of student data and thereby expressly prohibits the use of such student data for targeted advertising and selling. We fulfill SOPIPA requirements, we do not sell, share students’ data or create students’ profile from students’ data to third parties. Further we do not send any advertisements to the parents of students by using their data for non-educational purposes. </p>
