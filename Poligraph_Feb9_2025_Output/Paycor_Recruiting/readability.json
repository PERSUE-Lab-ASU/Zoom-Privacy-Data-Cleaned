This code is uniquely yours and allow you to use the Gravity application\u2019s functionality with minimal subsequent registration procedures. Cookies are also used to record you as the source of any candidate or job referrals on the Gravity application. If you apply for a job opening that has been shared through the Gravity application, Paycor will assign you a unique identifier and send such information to your computer or device hard drive in the form of a cookie. This code is unique to you and will correlate your job application to the person that posted such job opening on the Gravity application. It does not contain any of your Personal Information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Personal Profile Information</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you register on the Gravity application, Paycor uses a third-party provider, Akamai, to manage the Gravity application login registration process and create a personal profile for you on the Gravity application (\u201cPersonal Profile\u201d). Each Personal Profile is assigned a unique personal identification number and requires that you choose a username and password to access your Personal Profile on the Gravity application, which helps Paycor to ensure that only you can access your Personal Profile and Personal Information on the Gravity application. Because you assist Paycor in developing your Personal Profile username and password, you have a significant role in protecting your Personal Profile and Personal Information. No one can access or edit your Personal Profile without knowing your Personal Profile username and password, so do not share these with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Personal Choices</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Paycor acknowledges an individual\u2019s right to access their Personal Information. If you want to review or update your Personal Information, you may do so on the Gravity application by visiting your Personal Profile. Note that if you are a candidate (and not a user of the Gravity application) who would like to access your Personal Information, you will need to request this information from your Employer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Social Network Profiles</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you post a job opening on the Gravity application, Paycor will request your permission to access your social networks including, without limitation, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn so that you can share such job openings with your social network connections. Paycor will not post any job openings or other content on your social networks, or amend any of your posted job openings or content without your authorization. The Gravity application will also not track any of your social network activity, other than when you specifically use the Gravity application to share job openings on your social networks. All use of your Personal Information by any social network service provider is subject to each network\u2019s posted terms of service and privacy policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Vouching Content</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Paycor may ask you to vouch for people that have applied to job openings you have shared on the Gravity application. Your Employer will be responsible for determining who is allowed to view your responses to such vouching requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing Of Information \u2013 Gravity</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the circumstances articulated previously in this Privacy Policy above, with regard to the Gravity application, Paycor may also disclose your Personal Information with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your Employer, solely in regards to the existence of your Gravity application account, information on job openings you share using the Gravity application, your Gravity application account point totals, and vouching recommendations (pursuant to the Vouching Content section); and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Any other parties to whom you permit disclosure, including, without limitation, social network websites.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to Paycor. With the exception of Personal Profile login information stored by Akamai, as detailed under the Cookies section above, your Personal Information may be stored locally on your device and may be transmitted to servers owned, leased or utilized by Paycor in the United States.</p>\n\n      </div>\n  \n\n<div>\n        \n\n<h2>Paycor Recruiting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Recruiting application is used by companies to post job openings, collect potential job applicant information and track applicants through the hiring process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the provisions outlined in the Paycor Privacy Policy, the following information below applies to the use of Paycor Recruiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Users</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Recruiting application is accessed and used by two distinctly different types of users:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>companies that post job openings and review candidates who apply for those job openings;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>candidates for those job openings who use the Recruiting application to apply for them (\u201cApplicants\u201d).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants that do not consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy should not use the Recruiting application.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Text Messaging</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Users have an option to choose to receive text messages (SMS) from us to keep you informed of updates. This service is optional and does not require the purchase of goods or services from Paycor or its affiliates.

Once all relevant data has been updated, the profiles are pseudonymized and provided to the customer.
