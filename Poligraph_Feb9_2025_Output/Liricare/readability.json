Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy\n      Protection Act (CalOPPA)\n  \n  \n    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial\n      websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law\u2019s\n      reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or\n      company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that\n      operates websites collecting personally identifiable information\n      from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on\n      its website stating exactly the information being collected and\n      those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with\n      this policy.\n  \n  \n  \n    According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:\n  \n  \n  \n    0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;\n  \n  \n    0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word \u201cPrivacy\u201d, and can\n      easily be found on the home page of our website;\n  \n  \n    0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our\n      Privacy Policy Page;\n  \n  \n    0.4. users are able to change their personal information by\n      emailing us at SR@liricare.com.\n  \n  \n    Our Policy on \u201cDo Not Track\u201d Signals:\n  \n  \n    We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or\n      use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place.\n      Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to\n      inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.\n  \n  \n  \n    You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences\n      or Settings page of your web browser.\n  \n  \n  \n    12.

If\n      we have not sold your personal information, we will inform you of\n      that fact.\n  \n  \n    0.0.7. A list of categories of personal information that we have\n      disclosed for a business purpose, along with the category of any\n      other company we shared it with.\n  \n  \n    Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this\n      information up to two times in a rolling twelve-month period.

To delete your personal information. If you make this request,\n      we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the\n      date of your request from our records and direct any service\n      providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be\n      accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you\n      choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to\n      use certain functions that require your personal information to\n      operate.\n  \n  \n  \n    0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don\u2019t sell or\n      rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose.\n      We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration.\n      However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal\n      information to a third party, or within our family of companies,\n      without monetary consideration may be considered a \u201csale\u201d under\n      California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can\n      request disclosure or deletion at any time.\n  \n  \n  \n    If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information,\n      we will stop making such transfers.\n  \n  \n    Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it\n      may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to\n      participate in certain programs or membership services which require\n      the usage of your personal information to function. But in no\n      circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your\n      rights.\n  \n  \n  \n    To exercise your California data protection rights described above,\n      please send your request(s) by email: SR@liricare.com.\n  \n  \n  \n    Your data protection rights, described above, are covered by the\n      CCPA, short for the California Consumer Privacy Act. To find out\n      more, visit the official California Legislative Information website.\n      The CCPA took effect on 01/01/2020.\n  \n  \n  \n    13.
