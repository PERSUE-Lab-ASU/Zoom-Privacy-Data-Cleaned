<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Light Blue Software website privacy notice</h1>
<p>This privacy notice forms part of licence agreement that controls your use of our software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will treat your data in the same way that we would wish our own personal information to be treated. This notice explains how we use any personal information we collect from you through our website.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Collecting your information</h2>
<p>Most of our pages on our website can be accessed without giving us your personal information. If, however, you sign up for a free trial of our software or set up an account with us, we’ll ask you for your name and email address. We also record your activity and preferences when visiting our website through the use of cookies (see the Cookies section below).</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using your information</h2>
<p>We’ll use your personal information to activate your free trial and set-up your personal account with us. We undertake this processing because it is necessary to take steps to enter into a contract with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you agree to receive email updates or product support, we’ll use your name and email address to send this information to you. By sending this information to you, we are pursuing our legitimate interest to provide you with information regarding our products. You have the right to object or restrict to this processing at any time, just let us know (see the Contact section below), or click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email. We promise not to bombard you with information or irrelevant offers.</p>

<p>We also use social media providers to notify you of new features or training opportunities.</p>
