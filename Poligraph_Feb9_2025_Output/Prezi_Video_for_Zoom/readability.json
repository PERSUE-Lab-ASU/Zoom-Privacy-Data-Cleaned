How We Secure and Store Your InformationGeneral Security\n                                In order to protect both the Personal Data and the general information that we receive from you through your use of the Services, we have implemented various security measures. For example, when you enter Personal Data (such as your contact information) on our online forms, we encrypt that information using transport layer security (TLS). We also follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\n                            Risk of Interception\n                                Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out Personal Data online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that Data. While we strive to protect your Personal Data and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. We cannot guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through your use of the Services, and any Personal Data, general information, or other data or information is provided to us at your own risk.\n                            How Long We Keep Your Personal Data\u00a0\n                                We store the Personal Data we collect as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use the Services, or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide the Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.\u00a0\u00a0\n                            \n                                To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we may consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, certain risk factors, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.\n                            \n                                Once you delete your account, a presentation or a video we may not be able to recover it. If you have previously made a presentation or a video public, the presentation or the video or its parts, including the incorporated data, may still be discoverable via search engines and similar online resources and therefore viewable and accessible by any third parties. We have no control over search engines; however, you may send a request for deletion to major search engines in some cases.\n                            \n                                If we receive legal process pertaining to your account or have other legal document retention requirements, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with our preservation obligations. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your Personal Data to defend or assert our rights.\n                            16.
