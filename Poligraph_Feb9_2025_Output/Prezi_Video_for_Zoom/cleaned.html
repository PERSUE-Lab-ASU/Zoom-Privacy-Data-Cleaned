                                    We recognize and respect your privacy.  That means we only collect Personal Data we must have to fulfill our commitments and obligations to you.  If we do not need the information, we do not request it.
                                </li><li>
                                    We implement technology solutions (including encryption), process controls, and trained people to secure the data we do collect.

                                    We greatly limit who has access to your Personal Data to those with a job role that specifically supports a business purpose to support or fulfill our obligations.

                                    We have a record retention policy governing how long we retain information.

                                    This privacy policy addresses all Personal Data we may collect across customers and partners, etc.  For this reason, you may find some data references that seem odd to you; this is likely because we do not collect that type of information for your category. &nbsp;

                                    We do use cookies, primarily those for analytic data that are aggregated (not specific to you).  We may use some cookies to customize your experience; particularly if you have a customer portal or supplier portal account.

                                    We honor your rights to: 1) access, correct, delete your Personal Data and limit processing of your Personal Data; 2) receive Personal Data so that you can have another processor use it and 3) lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority / data protection authority.

Collected information may include or reflect personal information that could identify you, as well as non-personal information. We collect the following information from and about you:
                            </p><h3>Information you Share</h3><p><strong>True and Accurate</strong><br>
                                You represent and warrant that all information submitted through the Website will be true and accurate information.&nbsp; Pseudonymized or de-identified information or other erroneous or false information is prohibited and serves as a basis to terminate your account without recourse.
                            </p><h3>Account Information</h3><p>
                                You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public presentations. If you do choose to create an account and become a member, you must provide us with some Personal Data so that we can provide our services to you including your name, email address and/or phone number, occupation, title, and a password. If you choose to authenticate using a third-party account (e.g., Google), you authorize us to obtain account information from the third-party platform.
                            </p><h3>Payment Information</h3><p>
                                In order to gain access to specific premium features within our Services, you must provide us with payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.

                                The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing.&nbsp; For example, if you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.
                            </p><h3>Survey Information</h3><p>
                                From time to time, we may ask our registered users or visitors to participate in surveys. These surveys are optional. If you choose to participate, any information you provide to us, including Personal Data, will be linked with your account in our system. If you would not like your information to be used in this way, you have the option to not participate in surveys or, if you do participate, to provide us only with information you consent to our use of in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                            </p><h3>Content Information (User Content)</h3><p>
                                Parts of our Services allow users to upload, create and stream user content, including presentations, messages, comments, images, videos, and other materials. If you choose to upload Personal Data through these means in a manner that makes it visible to the public, we will consider that information public and will not limit its use or disclosure in the manner described in this
                                <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/" class="w--current">Privacy Policy</a>

                                You may create a profile and upload content such as presentations, videos, text, photographs, and artwork. Your profile may display information about you and your activities. This information may be accessed by others. Your videos may be viewed and otherwise accessed by others, and associated metadata (e.g., titles, descriptions, tags, etc.) are viewable by others. Your interactions with other users (e.g., comments, "likes") may be seen by others.
                            </p><p>
                                We may associate certain content information (such as titles, metadata, and digital art assets) that is stored in your presentations, infographics, videos or other free-form content inputs, such as comments, with Personal Data about you or others. Information in your presentations, videos, and infographics belong to you, and you are responsible for making sure that your content complies with our

                                If your content is made public, anyone (including us) may view its contents and potentially make other uses of it. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public presentations, videos or other content, Personal Data, such as your name, address, email addresses, and the like, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. If the user content you create through a paid Prezi account that is not accessible or viewable by other Prezi users or the public (“Private User Content”) is shared privately, those you have shared it with may use it in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Use, and/or inconsistent with your wishes, including disclosing it publicly. Please exercise discretion concerning those you share your Private User Content with.
                            </p><h2>‍</h2><h2>5. Information You Share About Others</h2><h3>Contact Information</h3><p>
                                Some components of the Services allow you and others to share User Content and send personal messages with other registered users and non-registered users. To use this feature, you must provide us with Personal Data about others including an email address for each recipient. For example, when collaborating on a presentation you may want feedback from other team members or non-team members and you can do so by adding those members as collaborators.
                            </p><h2>6. Additional Information We Receive About You</h2><h3>Use of the Services</h3><p>
                                When you visit our websites, sign in into our Services, interact with our email notifications, or visit a third-party service that includes content from our Services, we may receive information about you, or combine such information with other Personal Data. This service usage information includes data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited within our Services, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information.
                            </p><h3>Third-Party Services</h3><p>
                                We may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate. These services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data they collect. For example, if you click on an advertisement, you may be taken to the advertiser's website. Once on a third-party site, your data may be collected by others. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such services before using them.
                            </p><p>
                                You may use content and/or functionality from third-party services in your presentations, videos and User Content. This Privacy Policy covers our websites and apps, but does not cover any third-party site, content, or app.
                            </p><h3>Services you link to your account</h3><p>
                                We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate or link a third-party service with our Services, including information from the third party who provides the linked service. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you.

In particular, we use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services.

For example, we may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites and/or communications. Where you use multiple Services (e.g., Prezi Desktop, Prezi on the web or mobile device, Infogram), we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant information as you travel across our websites.

                                In order to protect both the Personal Data and the general information that we receive from you through your use of the Services, we have implemented various security measures. For example, when you enter Personal Data (such as your contact information) on our online forms, we encrypt that information using transport layer security (TLS). We also follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
                            </p><h3>Risk of Interception</h3><p>
                                Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out Personal Data online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that Data. While we strive to protect your Personal Data and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. We cannot guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through your use of the Services, and any Personal Data, general information, or other data or information is provided to us at your own risk.
                            </p><h3>How Long We Keep Your Personal Data&nbsp;</h3><p>

                                To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we may consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, certain risk factors, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
                            </p><p>
                                Once you delete your account, a presentation or a video we may not be able to recover it. If you have previously made a presentation or a video public, the presentation or the video or its parts, including the incorporated data, may still be discoverable via search engines and similar online resources and therefore viewable and accessible by any third parties. We have no control over search engines; however, you may send a request for deletion to major search engines in some cases.
