As noted in this privacy statement, we require California customers to opt-in to activities where we would share their personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California customer and you would like to prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to participate in these activities. If you are a California customer and you have opted in to one of these activities, but you later decide that you would like to prevent our disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us at&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:info@continuant.com"><span data-contrast="none">info@continuant.com</span></a><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-contrast="none">Overview.</span></strong><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;The information we gather generally falls into one of two categories: (1) personal information (for example, your name and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">email</span><span data-contrast="none">) that you voluntarily supply when you register with our Service, initiate transactions on or through the Service (such as buying products or services through the Service), or when you participate in the features we offer through the Service (such as comments posted on a blog, discussion group, or other social networking features on the Service), and (2) information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as visitors navigate through our Service. See the Browser Level Information and IP Addresses section below for further detail. In some cases, one of our agents or Affiliates may collect the information on our behalf. Third party Service Providers (as defined below) that provide all or some of the services available through this Service also may be gathering the same kinds of information on our behalf.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="none">Registration Information.</span></strong><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;To make use of certain features available through this Service (such as to receive email newsletters, to post a classified ad, or to participate in some social networking features) you may need to register and provide certain personal information as part of the registration process. (If permitted by this Service, you may be able to bypass some of the steps within the registration process by using the username and password associated with your account on certain specified social networking sites when you register for our Service, but you will still have to complete the registration process after entering that information.) We or our Service Providers may also ask for personal information from you if you buy products or services or conduct other transactions via our Service (for example: your name, email address, sex, age, zip code or credit card number, as well as information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like). The personal information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our Service to your interests and make them more useful to you. It may also be used in the processing of e-commerce transactions. In addition, our Service Providers may provide us with additional personal information about you that you provide to them through your separate accounts with them as described in their own privacy statements. The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such personal information is entirely voluntary. However, if you don’t supply the personal information we request, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other users of our Service. For instance, we can’t send you an email alerting you to a new service we’re offering, or breaking news that may interest you, if you don’t tell us what you’re interested in and give us your email address.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="none">Cookies.</span></strong><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;To help make our sites more responsive to the needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our users by placing a cookie (a small entry in a text file) on your device. Our advertisers and Service Providers may also assign their own cookies to your browser, which is a process that we don’t control. We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs and to deliver a better, more personalized service. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our site or other sites visited by our users. We may also use cookies to measure site performance. We can build a better Service if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. You can manage your browser’s cookie setting through the “options” menu on most commercially available web browsers, including options to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of our Service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><strong><span data-contrast="none">Browser Level Information and IP Addresses.</span></strong><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration or your mobile device when you use our Service, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you’re running, the resolution of your computer monitor or mobile device, the website that referred you, the type of device you’re using, your IP address and your geographic location. Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers and mobile devices connected to the Internet to identify your computer or mobile device so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Service to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our Service. We may combine this information with the personal information you give to us along with whatever information we collect about you. We may use this combined personal information for purposes set out in this privacy statement. We do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals. As such, your navigation of our Service may be tracked as part of the gathering of quantitative user information described above. If you arrive at our Sites by way of a link from a third party site that does respond to “do not track” requests, the recognition of any “do not track” request you have initiated will end as soon as you reach our Service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="none">Mobile Applications and Location-Based Information.</span></strong><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;Our Service may have the ability to use your geographic location to deliver content and services tailored to your location. If you choose to enable our Service to use your location information, then that information will be stored and used to deliver content and services tailored to your location. Also, when you use a mobile device or browser to access our Service, then your device and/or your browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your device’s unique identifier, IP address, location information, device make/model, wireless provider, and related information to us and our Service Providers. We and our Service Providers may combine this information with personal information you give to us and personal information we collect about you. We will use this combined personal information to deliver content and services tailored to your location.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-contrast="none">Service Providers.</span></strong><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;All or portions of our Service may be provided or supported by our third-party service providers (“Service Providers”), and we may share any of the information that we collect from you through our Service with such Service Providers. In the event we offer services through this Service such as chat, email newsletters, email services and/or similar services, such services may be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services. We will only work with trusted Service Providers who provide guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing to be carried out and who can demonstrate a commitment to compliance with those measures.
