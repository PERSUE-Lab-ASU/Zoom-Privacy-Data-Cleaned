<br><br></td>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Profiling operated by WeSchool has the following characteristics:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">context: Profiling can be associated both with the provision of the Services on the Platform by WeSchool and with the performance of marketing activities relating to WeSchool and / or third parties, as better described in point 4. Therefore, if the User access the Platform exclusively to use the Services and have opposed the marketing activities of WeSchool (point 4 letter f) or have not joined the marketing activities of third parties (point 4 letter h), Profiling will only be carried out in connection to the provision of the Services;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">subject: information on Users relating, for example, to age, to the school cycle to which they belong, to the location of the reference School (where available), to the type of content used within the Services (eg educational courses), suitable for disclosing tastes, preferences, lifestyle or consumption habits;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal basis: consent expressed by means of a positive action (flag) on ​​the Platform by Teachers, Adult Learners and Parents, in the name and on their own behalf and / or under 18 Learners;</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purpose: to make both the Services and the marketing activities more "personalized" on the possible interests and preferences of the Users and, therefore, to improve the degree of "satisfaction" of the Users both in the use of the Services provided on the Platform and in the receipt of commercial communications and WeSchool and / or third party promotions. Profiling is therefore aimed at defining the profile or personality of Users, or at analyzing consumption habits or choices, or at making predictions on future choices, or at monitoring the use of electronic communication services;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">effects for Users: use of Services on the Platform or receipt of commercial communications, in line with the interests and preferences expressed by Users in browsing the Platform and using the Services. In no way, WeSchool Profiling: i) constitutes an automated decision-making process from which legal or similarly significant effects derive for Users; ii) affects the behavior and training or purchasing choices of Users; iii) has a prolonged and permanent impact for Users, considering that the Personal Data collected by WeSchool can be independently updated at any time by the Users; as well as iv) does not discriminate against Users.</span></li>
