In this process, personal data such as inventory data (e.g. name, address, etc.), usage data (e.g. order ID, time of order, etc.), and metadata (e.g. IP address, geodata, etc.) are processed.\n          This data is used exclusively on the basis of your consent within the meaning of Article 6(1) (a) of the GDPR and Section 25(1) of the German Telecommunications and Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDSG).\n          Please refer to our listing of approved external tracking providers and their privacy policy: https://www.digistore24.com/extern/cms/page/frontend/legal/privacy_3rd_party/\n        \n        \n          \n              \n                13 - Order form\n              \n            \n          The data requested on the order form is transmitted to the product manufacturer on the basis of Article 6(1) (b) of the GDPR for the purpose of fulfilling the contract. In addition, it may be that the product manufacturer operates various tracking tools on the order form under its own responsibility. We have no insight into or influence over the data processed in this way. Digistore24 is purely a platform in this context, and provides this to the customer for the individual design. For more information about tracking, please contact the respective product manufacturer.\nIf the customer repeatedly purchases (possibly different) products from the same product provider (vendor), these orders are recorded by us under the same customer ID (customer number). This is necessary in order to identify related customer orders in the event of any customer queries and to improve customer support. This shall also be our legitimate interest in data processing (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).\n        \n        \n          \n              \n                14 - Disclosure of data to payment service providers\n              \n            \n          In the context of contractual relationships, we offer data subjects efficient and secure payment options and, in addition to banks and credit institutions, use other service providers for this purpose (collectively, \"payment service providers\")(Art. 6(1)(1)(b) GDPR).\n          The data processed by the payment service providers includes inventory data, such as name and address, bank data, such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and checksums, as well as the contract-, sum- and recipient-related information. The information is required in order to carry out the transactions. However, the data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them; i.e. we do not receive any account or credit card-related information, but only information with confirmation or negative information about the payment. Under certain circumstances, the data may be transmitted by the payment service providers to credit agencies. The purpose of this transmission is to check identity and creditworthiness. In this regard, we refer to the terms and conditions and the privacy notices of the respective payment service providers.\n          The terms and conditions and the privacy notices of the respective payment service providers, which can be accessed within the respective websites or transaction applications, shall apply to the payment transactions.\n          The types of data processed by payment service providers include: Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history); contractual data (e.g. subject matter of contract, term, customer category); usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times); meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n        \n        \n          \n              \n                15 - Credit report\n              \n            \n          Pursuant to  Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, we check information about your address data (if applicable, first name, last name, address) and your creditworthiness in order to protect legitimate interests. For this purpose, we cooperate with Creditreform Boniversum GmbH (credit rating), Hellersbergstra\u00dfe 11, 41460 Neuss, from whom we obtain or transmit data for these purposes. You can find the information pursuant to Article 14 of the GDPR on the data processing taking place at Creditreform Boniversum GmbH at: https://www.boniversum.de/eu-dsgvo/EU-DSGVO\n          Note\n          Within the scope of the consent given by the customer, the credit agency stores and transmits the data to the affiliated credit institutions, credit card companies, leasing companies, retail companies including mail order companies and other companies that commercially provide money or goods credits to consumers or offer telecommunication services in order to be able to provide them with information for assessing the creditworthiness of customers. Address data may be transmitted to companies that are contractually affiliated with the credit agency (e.g. SCHUFA/Boniversum) for the purpose of determining debtors. SCHUFA only transmits objective data without indicating the creditor; subjective value judgments, personal income and financial circumstances are not included in SCHUFA information. Credit agencies only make data available if a justified interest in the data transfer has been credibly demonstrated in the individual case. When providing information, the credit agency may also provide its contractual partners with a probability value calculated from its database to assess the credit risk (score procedure).\n        \n        \n          \n              \n                16 - Disclosure of data to our collection partner\n              \n            \n          Pursuant to  Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, in the event of a payment default, the data required for the collection of our claim will be passed on to our collection partner.
