<p><strong>At ClubRunner, we're committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information processed through this website, and our online subscription service (the "Services").&nbsp;</strong></p>

<div>This page sets out our privacy policy and describes why and how we collect, use and disclose personal information which you choose to provide to us on our website, as well as how to access, modify, or delete your personal information. This policy doesn't apply to anyone who isn't under our control or management, such as the operators of other websites that you might link to from our website. Such operators may have their own privacy policies, which might differ from ours.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h3><strong>How Will We Collect Personal Information?</strong></h3>

<div>You are under no obligation to disclose any personal information to us at any time. We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, whenever you participate in any interactive features of the Services such as filling out a form, requesting customer support, sending us an email, or calling us. &nbsp;In the process you may be asked to give your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and any other information you choose to provide for the purpose of these Services. We or a designated third party may collect payment and credit card information when you subscribe to our paid Services or purchase additional services.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>When you access or use our Services, we may automatically collect information about you, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Log Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, your general location, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cookies: We use cookies to store your login session and other information to make your navigation of our Services easier. More information on cookies is available below.</p>

<h4><strong>Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></h4>

<div>Our site uses "cookies" which are small files containing pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can set your browser to block them. Our cookies can contain information such as your user ID that our website uses to recognize you. Our cookies can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. The only personal information our cookies contain is the information you provide yourself. When you enter personal information on our website, your personal information will be linked to the cookie we save on your computer. If you do choose to delete your cookie, you may not be able to use the administrative features of the website.</div>

<div>On customer websites, where you engage with social share buttons (ex: Facebook Like Button or the share content buttons), the services that manage the social platform you get directed to may use cookies. ClubRunner is not affiliated with any of these services and all legalities surrounding the use of cookies are thus under the policies set by the social media platforms.</div>
