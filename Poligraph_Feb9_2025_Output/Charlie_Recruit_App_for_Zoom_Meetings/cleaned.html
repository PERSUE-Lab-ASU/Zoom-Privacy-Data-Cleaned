          <p class="paragraph-3">At CharlieHR, we believe in the importance of looking after your information and ensuring you have maximum control over it. Since we believe the results of our “polls” and “Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion” features should stay anonymous, this policy outlines how the responder (Team Member) acts as the data controller in this particular instance rather than the company they work for.<em><br></em></p>
          <p class="paragraph-3">We’ve amended our standard Privacy Policy to ensure you are clear on how we hold and process that data.<em><br></em></p>
