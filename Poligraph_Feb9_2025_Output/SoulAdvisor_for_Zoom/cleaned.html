<h4><strong>Disclosure of Personal information</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>Analysing your communications</strong></h5>

<p>We may review, scan, or analyse your communication sent or received using SoulAdvisor communication tools, (including communications with other Users) for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, analytics and customer support purposes.</p>

<p>For example, as part of fraud prevention reports, we may scan and analyse messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyse messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We may use automated methods where whenever reasonably possible, however, we may need to manually review some communications occasionally, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyse your messaging communications to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.</p>

<p>These activities are carried out based on SoulAdvisor’s legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with applicable laws and our Terms, preventing fraud, promoting safety, and improving and ensuring the adequate performance of our services.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to block the delivery of or review communications that we, at our sole discretion, believe may contain malicious content, spam, or that may pose a risk to you, our Users, SoulAdvisor, or others.</p>

<p>These communications and their contents may be disclosed in response to lawful government requests or legal process, in other circumstances in which we have a good faith belief that a crime has been committed by a use of our services, that an emergency exists that poses a threat to the safety of our users or another person, if necessary to protect our rights or property, or for us to render the service you have requested.</p>
