Please consult the \u201cHelp\u201d section of your browser for more information (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies\">Internet Explorer</a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en\">Google Chrome</a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/protect-your-privacy/cookies\">Mozilla Firefox</a>; or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/PH5042?locale=en_US\">Apple Safari</a>).

ONLINE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Analytics.</strong>&nbsp;We may use third-party analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics and HubSpot) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar technologies; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. &nbsp; For more information regarding your options to control analytics cookies and tracking technologies, please review the \u201cAnalytics\u201d section of the above chart.</p>\n<p><strong>Advertising.</strong>&nbsp;When you use the Services, we may display advertising to you about our products, services, and related features that we think may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>We work with a number of companies that assist in marketing our services to you on third party websites. These companies may collect information about online activities conducted on a particular computer, browser or device over time and across third-party websites or online services for the purpose of delivering advertising that is likely to be of greater interest to you, including about our Services, on sites and apps of third parties. These companies may use cookies and other similar technologies, often in conjunction with unique (anonymous) cookie identifiers, to collect data about your activities and interests, including the technologies described above. Some of these partners may use mobile device identifiers, such as Apple IDFAs and Google/Android Advertising IDs. Doing this allows the ad companies to recognize your computer or device each time they send you an online or mobile advertisement. In this way, the ad companies may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer or device, saw their advertisements and measure your interaction with each ad. This information allows ad companies to deliver targeted advertisements that may be of increased interest to you. We, or our advertising partners, may use these technologies and data points (e.g., mobile identifiers, cookie identifiers, location-based data), through other services, to target advertising on other sites or mobile apps. Sometimes, these identifiers may be derived from a hashed or encrypted version of personal information such as your email address. We may use this information to measure the performance of our advertising as well, for instance, to evaluate which ads or content our users prefer, or which are most effective. In addition, sometimes we or an advertising partner may tailor advertising to you across different devices.</p>\n<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device by non-affiliated, third-party providers.&nbsp; As described below, these providers may offer you a way to opt-out of the collection of information that is used for our interest-based advertising to you. We cannot guarantee that these instructions will not change, or that they will continue to be available; they are controlled by each third-party service provider, not us. For more information regarding your options to control cookies and tracking technologies, please review the \u201cTargeting and advertising\u201d section of the above chart.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice Concerning Do Not Track.</strong>&nbsp;Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.&nbsp; We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide our users with a \u201cForget this Device\u201d option in our Apps, as well as the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above.&nbsp; Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES\nTo collect the information in the \u201cInformation We Collect Through Automated Means\u201d section above, we and our service providers use web server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future.\n\nA web server log is a file where website activity is stored.\nAn SDK is a set of tools and/or code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Services.\nA cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you use the Services, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files.\nTracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email that are designed to: (1) collect usage information like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates; (2) measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising; and (3) access user cookie\n\nAs we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.\nPlease note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the \u201cHelp\u201d section of your browser for more information (e.g.,\u00a0Internet Explorer;\u00a0Google Chrome;\u00a0Mozilla Firefox; or\u00a0Apple Safari). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including flash cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at\u00a0Adobe\u2019s website.\u00a0 Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.\nExcept for strictly necessary cookies, all cookies used on our site will expire after a maximum of 1 year and thirty days.\u00a0 Below is additional information about the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them:\nPlease note that the above list of third party partners that place cookies on our Services is subject to change and thus this list may not include all such providers at any given time. If you have any questions about our use of cookies and similar technologies or if you would like to withdraw or adjust your consent to our use of the above cookies, please contact us at\u00a0 privacy@openreel.com.\n5. ONLINE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING\nAnalytics.\u00a0We may use third-party analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics and HubSpot) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar technologies; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. \u00a0 For more information regarding your options to control analytics cookies and tracking technologies, please review the \u201cAnalytics\u201d section of the above chart.\nAdvertising.\u00a0When you use the Services, we may display advertising to you about our products, services, and related features that we think may be of interest to you.\nWe work with a number of companies that assist in marketing our services to you on third party websites. These companies may collect information about online activities conducted on a particular computer, browser or device over time and across third-party websites or online services for the purpose of delivering advertising that is likely to be of greater interest to you, including about our Services, on sites and apps of third parties. These companies may use cookies and other similar technologies, often in conjunction with unique (anonymous) cookie identifiers, to collect data about your activities and interests, including the technologies described above. Some of these partners may use mobile device identifiers, such as Apple IDFAs and Google/Android Advertising IDs. Doing this allows the ad companies to recognize your computer or device each time they send you an online or mobile advertisement. In this way, the ad companies may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer or device, saw their advertisements and measure your interaction with each ad. This information allows ad companies to deliver targeted advertisements that may be of increased interest to you. We, or our advertising partners, may use these technologies and data points (e.g., mobile identifiers, cookie identifiers, location-based data), through other services, to target advertising on other sites or mobile apps. Sometimes, these identifiers may be derived from a hashed or encrypted version of personal information such as your email address. We may use this information to measure the performance of our advertising as well, for instance, to evaluate which ads or content our users prefer, or which are most effective. In addition, sometimes we or an advertising partner may tailor advertising to you across different devices.\nWe neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device by non-affiliated, third-party providers.\u00a0 As described below, these providers may offer you a way to opt-out of the collection of information that is used for our interest-based advertising to you. We cannot guarantee that these instructions will not change, or that they will continue to be available; they are controlled by each third-party service provider, not us. For more information regarding your options to control cookies and tracking technologies, please review the \u201cTargeting and advertising\u201d section of the above chart.\nNotice Concerning Do Not Track.\u00a0Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\u00a0 We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide our users with a \u201cForget this Device\u201d option in our Apps, as well as the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above.\u00a0 Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals. Learn more about\u00a0Do Not Track.\n6.
