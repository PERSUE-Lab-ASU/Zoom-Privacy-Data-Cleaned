The various rights are not absolute, and each is subject to certain exceptions:</p><ul><li>The right of access \u2013 You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not your personal information is being processed by us, and about certain other information (similar to that provided in this policy) about how it is used. You also have the right to access your personal information, by requesting a copy of the personal information concerning you, which in most cases will be provided free of charge. This is so you are aware and can check that we are using your information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We can refuse to provide information where doing so may reveal personal information about another person or would otherwise negatively impact another person\u2019s rights, or where your requests are repetitive and excessive.</li></ul><ul><li>The right to rectification (correction) \u2013 You can ask us to take measures to correct your personal information if it is inaccurate or incomplete (e.g., if we have the wrong name or address for you).</li></ul><ul><li>The right to erasure (deletion) \u2013 This is also known as the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your personal information where, for example, there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is however not a general right to erasure and there are some exceptions, e.g., where we need to use the information in defense of a legal claim or to comply with a legal obligation.</li></ul><ul><li>The right to restrict processing \u2013 You have the right to \u201cblock\u201d or suppress the further use of your personal information under certain conditions when we are assessing a request for rectification or as an alternative to erasure. When processing is restricted, we can still store your personal information, but may not use it further without your consent or just for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for reasons of important public interest.</li></ul><ul><li>The right to data portability \u2013 You have the right to obtain and reuse certain personal information for your own purposes across different organizations (being separate data controllers). This only applies to your personal information that you have provided to us that we are processing with your consent and for the purposes of contract fullfilment, which is being processed by automated means. In such a case we will provide you with a copy of your data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or (where technically feasible) we may transmit your data directly to a separate data controller.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>The right to object \u2013 You have the right to object to certain types of processing, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time insofar as that processing takes place for the purposes of our legitimate interests. We will be allowed to continue to process the personal information if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or we need this for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. If you object to the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process your personal information for such purposes.</strong></li></ul><ul><li>The right to withdraw consent \u2013 Where we process your personal information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of the processing that occurred prior to such withdrawal.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>The right to lodge a complaint \u2013 If you believe that we do not comply with applicable data protection laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint before any competent data protection authority. For a list of such authorities, please visit:\u202fhttps://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</li></ul><p>You may contact us any time at\u202fprivacy@berlitz.com\u202fto exercise these rights. Please note that data which cannot be used to identify you, e.g., data that has been anonymized for analysis purposes, is not affected by the above rights.</p><p><strong>Children\u2019s Privacy</strong></p><p>It currently is our policy not to knowingly collect personal information from any person under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without their consent, he or she should contact us at\u202fprivacy@berlitz.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will endeavor to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p><p>If you are under 18 years of age and live in California, you have the right to request removal of content posted by you on our websites. Upon receipt of a fully completed removal request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove content posted by you from our websites.

For example, your posted content may continue to appear on Berlitz\u2019 websites if it has been reposted by others or was independently posted by a third party, was posted by you anonymously, or if you were compensated for providing the content.
