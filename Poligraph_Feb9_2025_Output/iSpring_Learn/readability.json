Such data is processed by iSpring for its own purposes (as described above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in User Data will be processed by us on our Customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018data processor\u2019.\n\n\n       Accordingly, iSpring processes User Data strictly in accordance with our Customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Agreement and other commercial agreements with such Customer.\n\n\n      Personal information and content you provide through iSpring web-based services. iSpring Customers are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services, and for ensuring that all individuals using the Services on the Customer\u2019s behalf or at their request, as well as all individuals whose personal data may be included in Customer Data processed through the Services, have been provided with adequate notice and given informed consent to the processing of their personal data, where such consent is necessary or advised, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording, use or other processing of data through our Services are fully met by the Customer, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship. When Customers and iSpring partners use iSpring web-based services to process Personal Data in their content, iSpring acts as a data processor. The Customer of iSpring that owns an account in iSpring web-based services will be responsible for determining the purposes and means of the processing of the content and any Personal Data provided by Users of the account, and this iSpring Customer (or its end users) will be the data controller in regards to such processing.\n\n\n      Personal information and content you provide using YouTube API and the Zoom Apps features and functionality.

The legal ground depends on the Services you use and how you use them. To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal bases:\n\n\n\t\n\t\n Performance of a contract:\u00a0the use of your information is necessary to provide you the Services, customer support, and personalized features. If you order and use our Services, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that Services under the contract that we have with you;\n\t\n \n\t\n\t\n Legitimate interests:\u00a0the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, namely for information security. We also want to provide you with the best suitable content of the website, to improve and promote our products and services and the content on our website, and for administrative, fraud detection and legal purposes;\n\t\n \n\t\n\t\n Consent:\u00a0we may rely on your consent to use your Personal Data for specific purposes, for example, for sending newsletters and for certain direct marketing purposes.\n\t\n \n\n\n How we store and secure information we collect\n\n\n Information storage.\u00a0We use data hosting service providers in the United States, Ireland and Germany to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.\n\n\n Technical and organizational security procedures and data transfers.\u00a0We observe reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized access to and the misuse of your Personal Data. We use appropriate business systems and procedures to protect and safeguard your Personal Data. We also use security procedures and technical and physical restrictions for accessing and using the Personal Data on our servers. Only authorized personnel are permitted to access Personal Data in the course of their work.\n\n\n\t For more information on where we store your information and our security measures, please contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below.\n\n\n How long we keep information (retention procedures)\n\n\n\t iSpring will store your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary in order to maintain and expand our relationship and provide you with our Services and offerings; in order to comply with our legal and contractual obligations; or to protect ourselves from any potential disputes (i.e. as required by laws applicable to log-keeping, records and bookkeeping, and in order to have proof and evidence concerning our relationship, should any legal issues arise following your discontinuance of use), all in accordance with our data retention policy and this Policy. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.\n\n\n\t To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and the applicable legal requirements.\n\n\n\tIf you have any questions about our data retention policy, please contact us by e-mail at support@ispring.com.\n\n\n Site account information:\u00a0We retain your site account information for as long as your site account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.\n\n\n Information you share on the Services:\u00a0If your site account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display the content you provided.\n\n\n Managed accounts:\u00a0If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.\n\n\n Marketing information:\u00a0If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your iSpring site account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.\n\n\n Information you provide using the Zoom Apps features and functionality.\u00a0During integration with the Zoom App, iSpring retains the following information:\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t Zoom access keys\n\t\n \n\t\n\t\n\t\t Zoom event IDs\n\t\n \n\t\n\t\n\t\t at the end of an event, we request statistics on users who have attended the event.\n\t\n \n\n\n\t When the integration with the\u00a0Zoom Apps\u00a0is disabled, iSpring does not delete the event attendance statistics (except access keys and event identifiers) that is associated with users in iSpring web services, and could have been modified by iSpring system administrator. iSpring retains these statistics to ensure the integrity of Your account within iSpring web services. You can delete these data using\u00a0iSpring web services administrator panel.\n\n\n\t iSpring Web Services do not require an email address for registration for a webinar when You use the Zoom Webinar App. For Your convenience, iSpring transmits a special pregenerated email address to the Zoom Webinar App when you register for an event, which acts as a substitute for your real email address. Thus, connecting the integration through iSpring Web Services does not require Your (or end users\u2019) email addresses, and iSpring also does not transfer Your email addresses to third parties.\n\n\n How you can access and control your information\n\n\n\t Subject to some limits, you have certain rights regarding your Personal Data and the processing thereof. PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS CONTROL AND MAINTAIN ACCESS TO THEIR DATA THAT IS STORED BY ISPRING, AND WE MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA MAINTAINED BY OUR CUSTOMERS OR EVEN KNOW WHAT DATA IS BEING MAINTAINED.\n\n\n\t You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format.
