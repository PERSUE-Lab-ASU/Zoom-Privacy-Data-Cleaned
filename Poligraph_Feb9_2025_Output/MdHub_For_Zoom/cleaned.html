This Privacy Notice explains how mdhub, Inc., and its affiliates and/or subsidiaries (“mdhub”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal information (as defined below) in connection with our websites (the “Sites”) and mobile applications that we own and operate that link to this Privacy Notice, and the related content, platform, services, products, mobile apps, and other functionality offered on or through our services (collectively, the “Services”). It does not address our privacy practices relating to mdhub employees and other personnel. mdhub may provide Services to health professionals (“mdhub Clients”). In the course of providing such Services, we may collect your personal information on behalf of the mdhub Customers. We refer to this type of personal information as “Customer Data.” We collect and process Customer Data on behalf of the mdhub Customers subject to restrictions set forth in our contracts with them, including HIPAA business associate agreements. This Privacy Notice does not apply to our collection and processing of Customer Data. We recommend referring to the mdhub Customers’ privacy notice, including their HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (as applicable) for information on how they engage service providers, like us, to collect and process Customer Data on their behalf.</p><p>‍</p><h2>I. What is personal information?</h2><p>When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Notice, we mean any data or information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular natural person or household or any other data or information that constitutes “personal information”, “personal information,” or “personally identifiable information.”</p><p>‍</p><h2>II. Our collection and use of personal information</h2><p>We collect personal information in a variety of ways. For example, you may provide us your personal information when you apply to be a provider, send us messages, subscribe to our mailing lists, newsletters or other forms of marketing communications, participate in a survey, or use some other feature of our Services. We may link or combine your activities and information collected from you on our websites and mobile apps with information we receive from third parties, as well as information we collect automatically through tracking technologies (defined below). This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us.</p><p>Personal Information Collected from You We may collect the following categories of personal information submitted to us by individuals through the Services:</p><li>Provider Information, including first and last name, phone number, state of licensure, medical license number, specialty, referral information, current practice setting, whether you are board certified, and information regarding how you learned about mdhub.

Note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain services-related email communications (e.g., account verification, confirmations of transactions, technical or legal notices).</li><li>Feedback Information. We may also collect feedback and ratings you provide relating to our services or products. We use this information to communicate with you, to conduct market research, inform our marketing and advertising activities and improve and grow our business.</li><li>Recordings and transcription. With your permission, we collect voice recordings and request access to the microphone on your mobile device in order to facilitate recordings for the Service. These recordings will automatically transcribe text used as part of the Provider session with patients and will leverage generative AI models to provide enhanced functionality as part of the Services. Note the information collected through these recordings is subject to restrictions set forth in our HIPAA business associate agreements with Providers and is not subject to this Privacy Notice. You may withdraw permission to access your device’s microphone at any time from the ‘Settings’ app of your mobile device. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, whether federal, state, local or international, relating to the privacy of communication for all parties to a conversation, including without limitation, advising all participants in a recorded conversation that the conversation is being recorded and obtaining their consent, as required.</li><p>Personal Information from Third Parties We also obtain personal information from third parties; which we often combine with personal information we collect either automatically or directly from an individual.

You should always review and, if necessary, adjust their privacy settings on third-party websites and social media networks and services before sharing information and/or linking or connecting them to other services. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Services, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages about products and services that may be of interest to you.</li><li>Other Sources: We may also collect personal information about you that we do not otherwise have from, for example, publicly available sources, third-party data providers, brand partnerships, or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions.

In that case, the additional privacy notice will govern how we may process the information provided at that time.</p><p>‍</p><h2>III. How we use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information</h2><p>We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect information you provide to us and information about how you access and use the Services when you visit our services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual’s computer and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “tracking technologies”) and we may use third-party partners or technologies to collect this information.

We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.</li><li>Information about the way you access and use our Services, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our services, how frequently you access the Services, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the services from multiple devices, and other browsing behavior and actions you take on the Sites.</li><li>Information about how you use the Services, such as the pages you visit, the links you click, the ads you view and click on, videos you watch, and other similar actions.

Third-party data collection and online advertising</h2><p>We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We may permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our online services over time so that they may play or display ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Sites, AdID, precise geolocation and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider. We may engage in the following:</p><li>Social Media Platforms. We may display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other social media forums. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.</li><li>Third Party Partners. We work with a variety of third-party partners to provide advertising services. For example, we use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our Services on your browser or mobile device, log in to your account on our Services, or otherwise engage with us. We share a unique identifier, like a user ID, with Google to facilitate the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Services and to tailor our advertisements and content to you. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google's website, “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at <a href="https://www.mdhub.ai/www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a> . You can learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a> .</li><p>We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Services. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at <a href="https://google.com/ads/preferences">https://google.com/ads/preferences</a>, or by visiting NAI’s online resources at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a> .</p><p>To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) resources and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) online resources, at <a href="https://www.mdhub.ai/www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings menu on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). You may also be able to opt-out of some — but not all — interest-based advertising served by mobile ad networks by visiting <a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices">http://youradchoices.com/appchoices</a> and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.</p><p>Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our online services. It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.</p><p>‍</p><h2>VI.

Children’s personal information</h2><p>Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16. If an individual is under the age of 16, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 16 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly delete that personal information.</p><p>‍</p><h2>VIII. Links to third-party websites or services</h2><p>Our Services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Except where we post, link to or expressly adopt or refer to this Privacy Notice, this Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, any personal information practices of third-party websites and online services or the practices of other third parties. To learn about the personal information practices of third parties, please visit their respective privacy notices.</p><p>‍</p><h2>IX.
