The terms used are to be considered gender-neutral.<br><strong>In short:</strong> We provide you with comprehensive information about any of your personal data we process.</p><p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. However, this privacy policy is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. So long as it aids transparency, technical <strong>terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner, links</strong> to further information are provided and <strong>graphics</strong> are used. We are thus informing in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the context of our business activities if there is a legal basis for it. This is certainly not possible with brief, unclear and legal-technical statements, as is often standard on the internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative. Maybe you will also find some information that you have not been familiar with.<br>If you still have questions, we kindly ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the imprint, follow the existing links and look at further information on third-party sites. You can of course also find our contact details in the imprint.</p><p><strong>Scope</strong></p><p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by our company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). With the term personal data, we refer to information within the meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address and postal address of a person. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, be it online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:</p><ul><li>all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li><li>Social media presences and email communication</li><li>mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li></ul><p><strong>In short:</strong> This privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner by the company via the channels mentioned. Should we enter into legal relations with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p><p><strong>Legal bases</strong></p><p>In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.<br>Whenever EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course access the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU online at EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp;tid=122472826\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.</p><p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p><ol><li><strong>Consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of data you entered into a contact form.</li><li><strong>Contract</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR): We process your data in order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you. For example, if we conclude a sales contract with you, we need personal information in advance.</li><li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we will process your data. For example, we are legally required to keep invoices for our bookkeeping. These usually contain personal data.</li><li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your basic rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we have to process certain data in order to be able to operate our website securely and economically. Therefore, the processing is a legitimate interest.</li></ol><p>Other conditions such as making recordings in the interest of the public, the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not usually occur with us. Should such a legal basis be relevant, it will be disclosed in the appropriate place.</p><p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p><ul><li>In <strong>Austria</strong> this is the Austrian Data Protection Act (<strong>Datenschutzgesetz</strong>), in short <strong>DSG</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Germany</strong> this is the Federal Data Protection Act (<strong>Bundesdatenschutzgesetz</strong>), in short <strong>BDSG</strong>.</li></ul><p>Should other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p><p><strong>Contact details of the data protection controller</strong></p><p>If you have any questions about data protection, you will find the contact details of the responsible person or controller below:<br>Michael Lisch \u2013 Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer</p><p>WolfVision GmbH<br>Oberes Ried 14<br>6833 Klaus<br>\u00d6sterreich, Vorarlberg</p><p>E-Mail: <a href=\"mailto:wolfvision@wolfvision.com\">wolfvision@wolfvision.com</a>&nbsp;<br>Phone: <a href=\"tel:+43-(0)5523-52250\">+43-(0)5523-52250</a>&nbsp;<br>Company details: <a href=\"https://wolfvision.com/de/impressum\">https://wolfvision.com/de/impressum</a></p><p><strong>Storage Period</strong></p><p>It is a general criterion for us to store personal data only for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as any reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to keep certain data stored even after the original purpose no longer exists, such as for accounting purposes.</p><p>If you want your data to be deleted or if you want to revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible, provided there is no obligation to continue its storage.</p><p>We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided we have further information.</p><p><strong>Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation</strong></p><p>In accordance with Articles 13, 14 of the GDPR, we inform you about the following rights you have to ensure fair and transparent processing of data:</p><ul><li>According to Article 15 DSGVO, you have the right to information about whether we are processing data about you. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and to know the following information:<ul><li>for what purpose we are processing;</li><li>the categories, i.e. the types of data that are processed;</li><li>who receives this data and if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed;</li><li>how long the data will be stored;</li><li>the existence of the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing and the right to object to processing;</li><li>that you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below);</li><li>the origin of the data if we have not collected it from you;</li><li>Whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated to arrive at a personal profile of you.</li></ul></li><li>You have a right to rectification of data according to Article 16 GDPR, which means that we must correct data if you find errors.</li><li>You have the right to erasure (\u201cright to be forgotten\u201d) according to Article 17 GDPR, which specifically means that you may request the deletion of your data.</li><li>According to Article 18 of the GDPR, you have the right to restriction of processing, which means that we may only store the data but not use it further.</li><li>According to Article 20 of the GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that we will provide you with your data in a standard format upon request.</li><li>According to Article 21 DSGVO, you have the right to object, which entails a change in processing after enforcement.<ul><li>If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you may object to the processing. We will then check as soon as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li><li>If data is used to conduct direct advertising, you may object to this type of data processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for direct marketing.</li><li>If data is used to conduct profiling, you may object to this type of data processing at any time. We may no longer use your data for profiling thereafter.</li></ul></li><li>According to Article 22 of the GDPR, you may have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (for example, profiling).</li><li>You have the right to lodge a complaint under Article 77 of the GDPR. This means that you can complain to the data protection authority at any time if you believe that the data processing of personal data violates the GDPR.</li></ul><p><strong>In short:</strong> you have rights \u2013 do not hesitate to contact the responsible party listed above with us!</p><p>If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. For Austria, this is the data protection authority, whose website can be found at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dsb.gv.at/?tid=122472826\">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>. In Germany, there is a data protection officer for each federal state. For more information, you can contact the Federal Commissioner for <a href=\"https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html\">Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI)</a>. The following local data protection authority is responsible for our company:</p><p><strong>Austria Data protection authority</strong></p><p><strong>Manager: </strong>Mag.

We encrypt or pseudonymise personal data wherever this is possible. Thus, we make it as difficult as we can for third parties to extract personal information from our data.</p><p>Article 25 of the GDPR refers to \u201cdata protection by technical design and by data protection-friendly default\u201d which means that both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to server rooms) appropriate safeguards and security measures shall always be placed. If applicable, we will outline the specific measures below.</p><p><strong>TLS encryption with https</strong></p><p>The terms TLS, encryption and https sound very technical, which they are indeed. We use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to securely transfer data on the Internet.<br>This means that the entire transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured \u2013 nobody can \u201clisten in\u201d.</p><p>We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and meet privacy requirements through technology design <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN&amp;tid=122472826\">Article 25 Section 1 GDPR</a>). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information.<br>You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol , which is situated in your browser\u2019s top left corner in the left of the internet address (e.g. examplepage.uk), as well as by the display of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.<br>If you want to know more about encryption, we recommend you to do a Google search for \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki\u201d to find good links to further information.</p><p><strong>Communications</strong></p><figure><p><strong>Communications Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: Anyone who communicates with us via phone, email or online form<br>\ud83e\udd1d Processed data: e. g. telephone number, name, email address or data entered in forms.

The data is stored for this period of time or for as long as is legally required.</p><p><strong>Affected persons</strong></p><p>The above-mentioned processes affect all those who seek contact with us via the communication channels we provide.</p><p><strong>Telephone</strong></p><p>When you call us, the call data is stored in a pseudonymised form on the respective terminal device, as well as by the telecommunications provider that is being used. In addition, data such as your name and telephone number may be sent via email and stored for answering your inquiries. The data will be erased as soon as the business case has ended and the legal requirements allow for its erasure.</p><p><strong>Email</strong></p><p>If you communicate with us via email, your data is stored on the respective terminal device (computer, laptop, smartphone, \u2026) as well as on the email server. The data will be deleted as soon as the business case has ended and the legal requirements allow for its erasure.</p><p><strong>Online forms</strong></p><p>If you communicate with us using an online form, your data is stored on our web server and, if necessary, forwarded to our email address. The data will be erased as soon as the business case has ended and the legal requirements allow for its erasure.</p><p><strong>Legal bases</strong></p><p>Data processing is based on the following legal bases:</p><ul><li>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent): You give us your consent to store your data and to continue to use it for the purposes of the business case;</li><li>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (contract): For the performance of a contract with you or a processor such as a telephone provider, or if we have to process the data for pre-contractual activities, such as preparing an offer;</li><li>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests): We want to conduct our customer inquiries and business communication in a professional manner. Thus, certain technical facilities such email programs, Exchange servers and mobile network operators are necessary to efficiently operate our communications.</li></ul><p><strong>Data Processing Agreement (DPA)</strong></p><p>In this section, we would like to explain what a Data Processing Agreement is and why it is needed. As the term \u201cData Processing Agreement\u201d is quite lengthy, we will often only use the acronym DPA here in this text. Like most companies, we do not work alone, but also use the services of other companies or individuals. By involving different companies or service providers, we may pass on personal data for processing. These partners then act as processors with whom we conclude a contract, the so-called Data Processing Agreement (DPA). Most importantly for you to know is that any processing of your personal data takes place exclusively according to our instructions and must be regulated by the DPA.</p><p><strong>Who are the processors?</strong></p><p>As a company and website owner, we are responsible for any of your data that is processed by us. In addition to the controller, there may also be so-called processors involved. This includes any company or person who processes your personal data. More precisely and according to the GDPR\u2019s definition, this means: Any natural or legal person, authority, institution or other entity that processes your personal data is considered a processor. Processors can therefore be service providers such as hosting or cloud providers, payment or newsletter providers or large companies such as Google or Microsoft.</p><p>To make the terminology easier to comprehend, here is an overview of the GDPR\u2019s three roles:</p><p><strong>Data subject</strong> (you as a customer or interested party) \u2192 <strong>Controller</strong>&nbsp;(we as a company and contracting entity) \u2192 <strong>Processors</strong> (service providers such as web hosts or cloud providers)</p><p><strong>Contents of a Data Processing Agreement</strong></p><p>As mentioned above, we have concluded a&nbsp;DPA with our partners who act as processors. First and foremost, it states that the processor processes the data exclusively in accordance with the GDPR. The contract must be concluded in writing, although an electronic contract completion is also considered a \u201cwritten contract\u201d. Any processing of personal data only takes place after this contract is concluded. The contract must contain the following:</p><ul><li>indication to us as the controller</li><li>obligations and rights of the controller</li><li>categories of data subjects</li><li>type of personal data</li><li>type and purpose of data processing</li><li>subject and duration of data processing</li><li>location of data processing</li></ul><p>Furthermore, the contract contains all obligations of the processor. The most important obligations are:</p><ul><li>ensuring data security measures</li><li>taking possible technical and organisational measures to protect the rights of the data subject</li><li>maintaining a data processing record</li><li>cooperation with the data protection authority upon request</li><li>performing a risk analysis for any received personal data</li><li>subprocessors may only be appointed with the written consent of the controller</li></ul><p>You can see an example of what a&nbsp;DPA looks like at <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/data-processing-agreement/\">https://gdpr.eu/data-processing-agreement/</a>.

Common browsers are for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p><p>It is important to note that cookies are very useful little helpers. Almost every website uses cookies. More precisely, these are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other uses. HTTP cookies are small files that our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically placed into the cookie-folder, which is the \u201cbrain\u201d of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p><p>Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website to visit again, your browser submits these \u201cuser-related\u201d information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file, while in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p><p>The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser such as Chrome and the web server. The web browser requests a website and receives a cookie back from the server. The browser then uses this again as soon as another page is requested.</p><p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, as each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, trojans or other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC\u2019s information.</p><p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> _ga<br><strong>Value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152122472826-9<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> Differentiation between website visitors<br><strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years</p><p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p><ul><li>At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li><li>At least 50 cookies per domain</li><li>At least 3000 cookies in total</li></ul><p><strong>Which types of cookies are there?</strong></p><p>The exact cookies that we use, depend on the used services, which will be outlined in the following sections of this privacy policy. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p><p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p><p><strong>Essential cookies</strong><br>These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic functions of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. These cookies ensure the shopping cart does not get deleted, even if the user closes their browser window.</p><p><strong>Purposive cookies</strong><br>These cookies collect information about user behaviour and whether the user receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website\u2019s loading time as well as its behaviour in different browsers.</p><p><strong>Target-orientated cookies</strong><br>These cookies ensure better user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts sizes or data in forms stay stored.</p><p><strong>Advertising cookies</strong><br>These cookies are also known as targeting cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering customised advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p><p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be stored in a cookie.</p><p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265\">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called \u201cHTTP State Management Mechanism\u201d.</p><p><strong>Purpose of processing via cookies</strong></p><p>The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. You can find out more details below or from the software manufacturer that sets the cookie.</p><p><strong>Which data are processed?</strong></p><p>Cookies are little helpers for a wide variety of tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell which data is generally stored in cookies, but in the privacy policy below we will inform you on what data is processed or stored.</p><p><strong>Storage period of cookies</strong></p><p>The storage period depends on the respective cookie and is further specified below. Some cookies are erased after less than an hour, while others can remain on a computer for several years.</p><p>You can also influence the storage duration yourself. You can manually erase all cookies at any time in your browser (also see \u201cRight of objection\u201d below). Furthermore, the latest instance cookies based on consent will be erased is after you withdraw your consent. The legality of storage will remain unaffected until then.</p><p><strong>Right of objection \u2013 how can I erase cookies?</strong></p><p>You can decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies originate from, you always have the option of erasing, deactivating or only partially accepting cookies. You can for example block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.</p><p>If you want to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, or if you want to change or erase cookie settings, you can find this option in your browser settings:</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=122472826\">Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome</a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=122472826\">Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari</a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox?tid=122472826\">Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox</a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies?tid=122472826\">Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies</a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4027947/microsoft-edge-delete-cookies?tid=122472826\">Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge</a></p><p>If you generally do not want cookies, you can set up your browser in a way to notify you whenever a cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. This procedure varies depending on the browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search term \u201cdelete cookies Chrome\u201d or \u201cdeactivate cookies Chrome\u201d into Google.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>The so-called \u201ccookie directive\u201d has existed since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires your <strong>consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR). Within countries of the EU, however, the reactions to these guidelines still vary greatly. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG). In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this guideline was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG).</p><p>For absolutely necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given, there are legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to offer our visitors a pleasant user experience on our website. For this, certain cookies often are absolutely necessary.</p><p>This is exclusively done with your consent, unless absolutely necessary cookies are used. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR.</p><p>In the following sections you will find more detail on the use of cookies, provided the used software does use cookies.</p><p><strong>Customer Data</strong></p><figure><p><strong>Customer Data Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>\ud83d\udc65Affected parties: Customers or business and contractual partners<br>\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: Performance of a contract for the provision of agreed services or prior to entering into such a contract, including associated communications.<br>\ud83d\udcd3 Data processed: name, address, contact details, email address, telephone number, payment information (such as invoices and bank details), contract data (such as duration and subject matter of the contract), IP address, order data<br>\ud83d\udcc5 Storage period: the data will be erased as soon as they are no longer required for our business purposes and there is no legal obligation to process them.<br>\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR), Contract (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR)</p></figure><p><strong>What is customer data?</strong></p><p>In order to be able to offer our services and contractual services, we also process data from our customers and business partners. This data always includes personal data. Customer data is all information that is processed on the basis of contractual or pre-contractual agreements so that the offered services can be provided. Customer data is therefore all the information we collect and process about our customers.</p><p><strong>Why do we process customer data?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why we collect and process customer data. The main reason is that we simply need specific data to provide our services. Sometimes for example your email address may be enough. But if you purchase a product or service, we may e. g. also need data such as your name, address, bank details or other contract data. This data will subsequently be used for marketing and sales optimisation so that we can improve our overall service for our customers and clients. Another important reason for data processing is our customer service, which is very important to us. We want you to have the opportunity to contact us at any time with questions about our offers. Thus, we may need certain data such as your email address at the very least.</p><p><strong>What data is processed?</strong></p><p>Exactly which data is stored can only be shown by putting them in categories. All in all, it always depends on which of our services you receive. In some cases, you may only give us your email address so that we can e. g. contact you or answer your questions. In other instances, you may purchase one of our products or services.

This can for example be the case when a business contract ends. Thereafter, the limitation period is usually 3 years, although longer periods may be possible in individual cases. Of course, we also comply with the statutory retention requirements. Your customer data will certainly not be passed on to third parties unless you have given your explicit consent.</p><p><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p><p>The legal basis for the processing of your data is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a GDPR (consent), Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter b GDPR (contract or pre-contractual measures), Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f GDPR (legitimate interests) and in special cases (e. g. medical services) Art. 9 (2) lit.

Below you can explore what we mean by the rather broad term \u201cpersonal data\u201d.</p><p>Please only enter the data we need for the registration. In case you are registering on behalf of a third party, please only enter data for which you have the approval of the party you are registering for. If possible, use a secure password that you don\u2019t use anywhere else and an email address that you check regularly.</p><p>In the following, we will inform you about the exact type of data processing we do. After all, we want you to feel at ease with the services we provide!</p><p><strong>What is a registration?</strong></p><p>When you register, we retain certain of your data in order to make it easy for you to log in with us online and use your account. An account with us has the advantage that you don\u2019t have to re-enter everything every time. It saves time and effort and ultimately prevents any issues with the provision of our services.</p><p><strong>Why do we process personal data?</strong></p><p>In short, we process personal data to make account registration and usage possible for you. If we didn\u2019t do this, you would have to enter all your data each time, wait for our approval and then enter everything again. This strenuous process would probably not only irritate us a little, but also many of our dear clients and customers.</p><p><strong>Which data is processed?</strong></p><p>Any data that you provided during registration or login and any data that you may enter as part of managing your account data.</p><p>During registration, we process the following types of data:</p><ul><li>First name</li><li>Last name</li><li>Email address</li><li>Company name</li><li>Street + house number</li><li>Residence</li><li>Postcode</li><li>Country</li></ul><p>During your registration, we process any data you enter, such as your username and password, along with data that is collected in the background such as your device information and IP addresses.</p><p>When using your account, we process any data you enter while using the account, as well as any data that is created while you use our services.</p><p><strong>Storage time</strong></p><p>We store the entered data for at least as long as the account associated with the data exists with us and is in use \u2013 and as long as there are contractual obligations between you and us. In case the contract ends, we retain the data until the respective claims get time-barred. Moreover, we store your data as long as we are subject to legal storage obligations, if applicable. Following that, we keep any accounting records (invoices, contract documents, account statements, etc.) of the contract for 10 years (\u00a7 147 AO) and other relevant business documents for 6 years (\u00a7 247 HGB) after accrual.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You have registered, entered data and want to revoke the data processing? Not a problem. As you can see above, you retain this right under the General Data Protection Regulation also at and after registration, login or account creation with us. Contact the Data Protection Officer above to exercise your rights. If you already have an account with us, you can easily view and manage your data and texts in your account.</p><p><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p><p>By completing the registration process, you enter into a pre-contractual agreement with us, with the intention to conclude a contract of use for our platform (although there is no automatic payment obligation). You invest time to enter data and register and in return, we offer you our services after you log on to our system and view your customer account. We also meet our contractual obligations. Finally, we need to be able to email registered users about important changes. Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (implementation of pre-contractual measures, fulfilment of a contract) applies.</p><p>Where applicable, we will ask for your consent, e.g. in case you voluntarily provide more data than is absolutely necessary, or in case we may ask you if we may send you advertising. Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent) applies in this matter.</p><p>We also have a legitimate interest in knowing who who our clients or customers are, in order to get in touch if required. We also need to know who is using our services and whether they are being used in accordance with our terms of use, i.e. Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests) applies in this matter.</p><p>Note: the following sections are to be ticked by users (as required):</p><p><strong>Registration with real names</strong></p><p>Since business operations require us to know who our clients or customers are, registration is only possible with your real name (full name) and not with a pseudonym.</p><p><strong>Registration with pseudonyms</strong></p><p>You can use a pseudonym for the registration, which means you don\u2019t have to register with your real name. This ensures that your real name cannot be processed by us.</p><p><strong>Storage of the IP address</strong></p><p>During registration, login and account use, we store your IP address for security reasons in order to be able to determine legitimate use.</p><p><strong>Public Profile</strong></p><p>User profiles are publicly visible, i.e. parts of the profiles can also be viewed on the Internet without the need to enter a username and password.</p><p><strong>Two Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></p><p>Two Factor Authentication (2FA) offers additional security when logging in, as it prevents you from logging in without a smartphone, for example. This technical measure to secure your account protects you against the loss of data or unauthorised access, even if your username and password were leaked. During your registration process, login or within the account itself y ou can find out which 2FA is used.</p><p><strong>Web hosting</strong></p><figure><p><strong>Web hosting Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: visitors to the website<br>\ud83d\udcd3 Purpose: professional hosting of the website and security of operations<br>\ud83e\udd1d Processed data: IP address, time of website visit, browser used and other data.

This data should be processed as sparingly as possible, and only with good reason. By website, we mean the entirety of all websites on your domain, i.e. everything from the homepage to the very last subpage (like this one here). By domain we mean example.uk or examplepage.com.</p><p>When you want to view a website on a screen, you use a program called a web browser. You probably know the names of some web browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.</p><p>The web browser has to connect to another computer which stores the website\u2019s code: the web server. Operating a web server is complicated and time-consuming, which is why this is usually done by professional providers. They offer web hosting and thus ensure the reliable and flawless storage of website data.</p><p>Whenever the browser on your computer establishes a connection (desktop, laptop, smartphone) and whenever data is being transferred to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. After all, your computer stores data, and the web server also has to retain the data for a period of time in order to ensure it can operate properly.</p><p>Illustration:</p><p><strong>Why do we process personal data?</strong></p><p>The purposes of data processing are:</p><ol><li>Professional hosting of the website and operational security</li><li>To maintain the operational as well as IT security</li><li>Anonymous evaluation of access patterns to improve our offer, and if necessary, for prosecution or the pursuit of claims.li&gt;</li></ol><p><strong>Which data are processed?</strong></p><p>Even while you are visiting our website, our web server, that is the computer on which this website is saved, usually automatically saves data such as</p><ul><li>the full address (URL) of the accessed website (e. g. https://www.examplepage.uk/examplesubpage.html?tid=122472826)</li><li>browser and browser version (e.g. Chrome 87)</li><li>the operating system used (e.g. Windows 10)</li><li>the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e. g. https://www.examplepage.uk/icamefromhere.html/)</li><li>the host name and the IP address of the device from the website is being accessed from (e.g. COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)</li><li>date and time</li><li>in so-called web server log files</li></ul><p><strong>How long is the data stored?</strong></p><p>Generally, the data mentioned above are stored for two weeks and are then automatically deleted. We do not pass these data on to others, but we cannot rule out the possibility that this data may be viewed by the authorities in the event of illegal conduct.</p><p><strong>In short:</strong> Your visit is logged by our provider (company that runs our website on special computers (servers)), but we do not pass on your data without your consent!</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>The lawfulness of processing personal data in the context of web hosting is justified in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (safeguarding of legitimate interests), as the use of professional hosting with a provider is necessary to present the company in a safe and user-friendly manner on the internet, as well as to have the ability to track any attacks and claims, if necessary.</p><p><strong>Hetzner Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>We use Hetzner for our website, which is a web hosting provider, among other things.

This is a special form of Content Management System (CMS). Website builders enable website operators to create websites very easily and without any programming knowledge. In many cases, web hosts also offer website builders. Your personal data may be collected, stored and processed if a website builder is being used. In this Privacy Policy, you will find general information about data that is processed by such modular website builder systems. You can find more information in the respective provider\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>Why do we use website builders for our website?</strong></p><p>The greatest advantage of modular website builders is their ease of use. We want to offer you a clear, simple and nicely designed website that we can easily operate and maintain by ourselves \u2013 without needing any external support. Nowadays website builders offer many helpful functions that we can use even without having any programming knowledge. This enables us to design our website according to our wishes and therefore, to give you an informative and pleasant experience on our website.</p><p><strong>Which data are stored by website builders?</strong></p><p>First of all, the exact data that is stored depends on the website builder that is being used. Each provider processes and collects different data from website visitors. However, technical usage information such as users\u2019 operating system, browser, screen resolution, language and keyboard settings, hosting provider as well as the date of the website visit are usually collected. Moreover, tracking data (e. g. browser activity, clickstream activities, session heat maps, etc.) may also be processed. The same goes for personal data, since data such as contact information e. g. email address, telephone number (if you have provided it), IP address and geographic location data may also be processed and stored. In the respective provider\u2019s Privacy Policy you can find out exactly which of your data is getting stored.</p><p><strong>How long and where are the data stored?</strong></p><p>Provided that we have any further information on this, we will inform you below about the duration of the data processing associated with the website builder we use. You can find detailed information on this in the provider\u2019s Privacy Policy. Generally, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide our services and products. The provider may store your data according to their own specifications, over which we have no influence.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You always retain the right to information, rectification and erasure of your personal data. If you have any questions, you can also contact the responsible parties at the respective website builder system at any time. You can find the corresponding contact details either in our Privacy Policy or on the website of the respective provider.</p><p>What is more, in your browser you can clear, disable or manage cookies that providers use for their functions. Depending on the browser you use, this can be done in different ways. Please note, that this may lead to not all functions working as usual anymore.</p><p><strong>Legal Bases</strong></p><p>We have a legitimate interest in using a website builder system to optimise our online service and present it in an efficient and user-friendly way. The corresponding legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use the website builder system if you have consented to it.</p><p>If the processing of data is not absolutely necessary for the operation of the website, your data will only be processed on the basis of your consent. This particularly applies to tracking activities. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR.</p><p>With this Privacy Policy, we have made you more familiar with the most important general information on data processing. If you want to find out more about this, you will find further information \u2013 if available \u2013 in the following section or in the Privacy Policy of the provider.</p><p><strong>Joomla!

A CMS is a software that helps us design our website and display content beautifully and in an organized manner. The content can include text, audio, and video.<br>By using WordPress, personal data about you may also be collected, stored, and processed. Typically, mainly technical data such as operating system, browser, screen resolution, or hosting provider are stored. However, personal data such as IP address, geographic data, or contact information may also be processed.</p><p><strong>Why do we use WordPress?</strong></p><p>Programming is not one of our core competencies. Nevertheless, we want to have a powerful and attractive website that we can manage and maintain ourselves. With a website builder system or a content management system like WordPress, this is possible. With WordPress, we don\u2019t need to be programming experts to offer you a beautiful website. Thanks to WordPress, we can quickly and easily operate our website even without technical knowledge. If technical problems arise or we have special requests for our website, we still have our experts who are familiar with HTML, PHP, CSS, and the like.</p><p><strong>How secure is the data transfer with WordPress?</strong></p><p>WordPress processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. WordPress is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA.

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, WordPress commits to maintaining the European data protection level when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding Standard Contractual Clauses here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847</a>.</p><p>The data processing conditions (Data Processing Agreements), which correspond to the standard contractual clauses, can be found at <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/data-processing-agreements/\">https://wordpress.com/support/data-processing-agreements/</a>.</p><p>You can learn more about the data processed through the use of WordPress.com in the privacy policy at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://automattic.com/de/privacy/?tid=122472826\">https://automattic.com/de/privacy/</a>.</p><p><strong>Web Analytics</strong></p><figure><p><strong>Web Analytics Privacy Policy Overview&nbsp;</strong><br>\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: visitors to the website<br>\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: Evaluation of visitor information to optimise the website.<br>\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: Access statistics that contain data such as access location, device data, access duration and time, navigation behaviour, click behaviour and IP addresses.

Thus, data is collected, which the analytic tool provider (also called tracking tool) stores, manages and processes. Analyses of user behaviour on our website are created with this data, which we as the website operator receive. Most tools also offer various testing options. These enable us, to for example test which offers or content our visitors prefer. For this, we may show you two different offers for a limited period of time. After the test (a so-called A/B test) we know which product or content our website visitors find more interesting. For such testing as well as for various other analyses, user profiles are created and the respective data is stored in cookies.</p><p><strong>Why do we run Web Analytics?</strong></p><p>We have a clear goal in mind when it comes to our website: we want to offer our industry\u2019s best website on the market. Therefore, we want to give you both, the best and most interesting offer as well as comfort when you visit our website. With web analysis tools, we can observe the behaviour of our website visitors, and then improve our website accordingly for you and for us. For example, we can see the average age of our visitors, where they come from, the times our website gets visited the most, and which content or products are particularly popular. All this information helps us to optimise our website and adapt it to your needs, interests and wishes.</p><p><strong>Which data are processed?</strong></p><p>The exact data that is stored depends on the analysis tools that are being used. But generally, data such as the content you view on our website are stored, as well as e. g. which buttons or links you click, when you open a page, which browser you use, which device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) you visit the website with, or which computer system you use. If you have agreed that location data may also be collected, this data may also be processed by the provider of the web analysis tool.</p><p>Moreover, your IP address is also stored. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), IP addresses are personal data. However, your IP address is usually stored in a pseudonymised form (i.e. in an unrecognisable and abbreviated form). No directly linkable data such as your name, age, address or email address are stored for testing purposes, web analyses and web optimisations. If this data is collected, it is retained in a pseudonymised form. Therefore, it cannot be used to identify you as a person.</p><p>The following example shows Google Analytics\u2019 functionality as an example for client-based web tracking with JavaScript code.</p><p>The storage period of the respective data always depends on the provider. Some cookies only retain data for a few minutes or until you leave the website, while other cookies can store data for several years.</p><p><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></p><p>If we have any further information on the duration of data processing, you will find it below. We generally only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide products and services. The storage period may be extended if it is required by law, such as for accounting purposes for example for accounting.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You also have the option and the right to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data processing by cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing cookies in your browser.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>The use of Web Analytics requires your consent, which we obtained with our cookie popup. According to <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR (consent)</strong>, this consent represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, such as by collection through Web Analytics tools.</p><p>In addition to consent, we have a legitimate interest in analysing the behaviour of website visitors, which enables us to technically and economically improve our offer. With Web Analytics, we can recognise website errors, identify attacks and improve profitability. The legal basis for this is <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. Nevertheless, we only use these tools if you have given your consent.</p><p>Since Web Analytics tools use cookies, we recommend you to read our privacy policy on cookies. If you want to find out which of your data are stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies of the respective tools.</p><p>If available, information on special Web Analytics tools can be found in the following sections.</p><p><strong>Cloudflare Web Analytics Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>We use the analysis tool Cloudflare Web Analytics for our website.

For the European region, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services. Google Analytics collects data about your actions on our website. By combining various technologies such as cookies, device IDs, and login information, you can be identified as a user across different devices. This allows your actions to be analyzed across platforms as well.</p><p>For example, when you click on a link, this event is stored in a cookie and sent to Google Analytics. With the reports we receive from Google Analytics, we can better tailor our website and service to your needs. In the following, we will provide more information about the tracking tool and specifically inform you about the data processed and how you can prevent it.</p><p>Google Analytics is a tracking tool used for website traffic analysis. The basis for these measurements and analyses is a pseudonymous user identification number. This number does not include personally identifiable information such as name or address but is used to assign events to a device. GA4 utilizes an event-based model that captures detailed information about user interactions such as page views, clicks, scrolling, and conversion events. Additionally, GA4 incorporates various machine learning features to better understand user behavior and certain trends. GA4 employs modeling through machine learning capabilities, meaning that based on the collected data, missing data can be extrapolated to optimize the analysis and provide forecasts.</p><p>In order for Google Analytics to function properly, a tracking code is embedded in the code of our website. When you visit our website, this code records various events that you perform on our website. With GA4\u2019s event-based data model, we, as website operators, can define and track specific events to obtain analyses of user interactions. This allows us to track not only general information such as clicks or page views but also specific events that are important for our business, such as submitting a contact form or making a purchase.</p><p>Once you leave our website, this data is sent to and stored on Google Analytics servers.</p><p>Google processes the data, and we receive reports on your user behavior. These reports can include, among others, the following:</p><ul><li>Audience reports: Audience reports help us get to know our users better and gain a more precise understanding of who is interested in our service.</li><li>Advertising reports: Advertising reports make it easier for us to analyze and improve our online advertising.</li><li>Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide helpful information on how we can attract more people to our service.</li><li>Behavior reports: Here, we learn about how you interact with our website. We can track the path you take on our site and which links you click on.</li><li>Conversion reports: Conversion refers to an action you take as a result of a marketing message, such as going from being a website visitor to becoming a buyer or newsletter subscriber. Through these reports, we gain insights into how our marketing efforts resonate with you, with the aim of improving our conversion rate.</li><li>Real-time reports: With real-time reports, we can see what is currently happening on our website. For example, we can see how many users are currently reading this text.</li></ul><p>In addition to the above-mentioned analysis reports, Google Analytics 4 also offers the following functions:</p><ul><li>Event-based data model: This model captures specific events that can occur on our website, such as playing a video, making a purchase, or subscribing to our newsletter.</li><li>Advanced analytics features: With these features, we can gain a better understanding of your behavior on our website or certain general trends. For example, we can segment user groups, conduct comparative analyses of target audiences, or track your path on our website.</li><li>Predictive modeling: Based on the collected data, missing data can be extrapolated through machine learning to predict future events and trends. This can help us develop better marketing strategies.</li><li>Cross-platform analysis: Data collection and analysis are possible from both websites and apps. This enables us to analyze user behavior across platforms, provided you have consented to data processing.</li></ul><p><strong>Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?</strong></p><p>Our goal with this website is clear: we want to provide you with the best possible service. The statistics and data from Google Analytics help us achieve this goal.</p><p>The statistically evaluated data gives us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On one hand, we can optimize our site to make it more easily found by interested people on Google. On the other hand, the data helps us better understand you as a visitor. We know exactly what we need to improve on our website in order to provide you with the best possible service. The data also helps us conduct our advertising and marketing activities in a more personalized and cost-effective manner. After all, it only makes sense to show our products and services to people who are interested in them.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by Google Analytics?</strong></p><p>With the help of a tracking code, Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID associated with your browser cookie. This way, Google Analytics recognizes you as a new user, and a user ID is assigned to you. When you visit our site again, you are recognized as a \u201creturning\u201d user. All collected data is stored together with this user ID, making it possible to evaluate pseudonymous user profiles.</p><p>To analyze our website with Google Analytics, a property ID must be inserted into the tracking code. The data is then stored in the corresponding property. For each newly created property, the default is Google Analytics 4 Property. The data storage duration varies depending on the property used.</p><p>Through identifiers such as cookies, app instance IDs, user IDs, or custom event parameters, your interactions, if you have consented, are measured across platforms. Interactions encompass all types of actions you perform on our website. If you also use other Google systems (such as a Google account), data generated through Google Analytics can be linked to third-party cookies. Google does not disclose Google Analytics data unless we, as website operators, authorize it, except when required by law.</p><p>According to Google, IP addresses are not logged or stored in Google Analytics 4. However, IP address data is used by Google for deriving location data and is immediately deleted thereafter. All IP addresses collected from users in the EU are deleted before the data is stored in a data center or on a server.</p><p>Since GA4 focuses on event-based data, the tool uses significantly fewer cookies compared to previous versions such as Google Universal Analytics. However, there are still some specific cookies used by GA4. These can include:</p><p>Name: _ga<br>Value: 2.1326744211.152122472826-5<br>Purpose: By default, analytics.js uses the _ga cookie to store the user ID. It is used to distinguish website visitors.<br>Expiration: After 2 years</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> _gid<br><strong>Value:</strong> 2.1687193234.152122472826-1<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> This cookie is also used to distinguish website visitors.<br><strong>Expiration:</strong> After 24 hours</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> gat_gtag_UA Value: 1<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> Used to reduce the request rate. If Google Analytics is deployed via Google Tag Manager, this cookie will be named dc_gtm .<br><strong>Expiration:</strong> After 1 minute</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This list cannot claim to be exhaustive, as Google may change their choice of cookies from time to time. GA4 aims to improve data privacy and offers several options for controlling data collection. For example, we can determine the storage duration ourselves and control data.</p><p>Here we provide an overview of the main types of data collected by Google Analytics:</p><p><strong>Heatmaps:</strong> Google creates heatmaps to show the exact areas you click on. This provides us with information about your interactions on our site.</p><p><strong>Session Duration:</strong> Google refers to session duration as the time you spend on our site without leaving. If you are inactive for 20 minutes, the session automatically ends.</p><p><strong>Bounce Rate:</strong> Bounce rate refers to when you view only one page on our website and then leave.</p><p><strong>Account Creation:</strong> If you create an account or place an order on our website, Google Analytics collects this data.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> IP addresses are not logged or stored in Google Analytics. However, location data is derived shortly before the IP address is deleted.</p><p><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Technical information includes your browser type, internet service provider, and screen resolution, among others.</p><p><strong>Source of Origin:</strong> Google Analytics is interested in the website or advertisement that brought you to our site.</p><p>Additional data may include contact information, reviews, media playback (e.g., if you play a video on our site), sharing of content via social media, or adding to favorites. This list is not exhaustive and serves only as a general guide to the data storage by Google Analytics.</p><p><strong>Where and how long are the data stored?</strong></p><p>Google has servers distributed worldwide. You can find precise information about the locations of Google data centers at: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=en\">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=en</a></p><p>Your data is distributed across multiple physical storage devices. This ensures faster access to data and better protection against manipulation. Each Google data center has emergency programs in place for your data. In the event of hardware failure or natural disasters, the risk of service interruption at Google remains low.</p><p>The retention period of data depends on the properties used. The storage duration is always set separately for each individual property. Google Analytics offers us four options for controlling the storage duration:</p><ul><li>2 months: This is the shortest storage period.</li><li>14 months: By default, data is stored in GA4 for 14 months.</li><li>26 months: Data can also be stored for 26 months.</li><li>Data is only deleted manually.</li></ul><p>In addition, there is also the option for data to be deleted only if you do not visit our website within the selected time period. In this case, the retention period is reset every time you revisit our website within the defined time frame.</p><p>Once the defined period has expired, the data is deleted once a month. This retention period applies to data linked to cookies, user identification, and advertising IDs (e.g., cookies from the DoubleClick domain). Report results are based on aggregated data and are stored independently of user data. Aggregated data is a combination of individual data into larger units.</p><p><strong>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</strong></p><p>Under the data protection laws of the European Union, you have the right to access, update, delete, or restrict your data. By using the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics JavaScript (analytics.js, gtag.js), you can prevent Google Analytics 4 from using your data. You can download and install the browser add-on at: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en\">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a> Please note that this add-on only disables data collection by Google Analytics.</p><p>If you want to disable, delete, or manage cookies in general, you can find the respective instructions for the most common browsers in the \u201cCookies\u201d section.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>The use of Google Analytics requires your consent, which we obtained through our cookie popup. According to <strong>Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR</strong>, this consent constitutes the legal basis for the processing of personal data that may occur during the collection by web analytics tools.</p><p>In addition to consent, we also have a legitimate interest in analyzing the behavior of website visitors to improve our offering technically and economically. By using Google Analytics, we can identify website errors, detect attacks, and improve efficiency. The legal basis for this is <strong>Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR</strong> (legitimate interests). However, we only use Google Analytics if you have given your consent.</p><p>Google processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. Google is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA.

These reports on demographic characteristics and interests contain details about age, gender and interests. Through them we can get a better picture of our users \u2013 without being able to allocate any data to individual persons.

Through this, any existing Google Analytics functions (advertising reports, remarketing, cross-device reports and reports on interests and demographic characteristics) are updated, to result in the summary and anonymisation of your data, should you have permitted personalised ads in your Google Account.</p><p>The special aspect of this is that it involves cross-device tracking. That means your data can be analysed across multiple devices. Through the activation of Google signals, data is collected and linked to the Google account. For example, it enables Google to recognise when you look at a product on a smartphone and later buy the product on a laptop. Due to activating Google signals, we can start cross-device remarketing campaigns, which would otherwise not be possible to this extent. Remarketing means, that we can show you our products and services across other websites as well.</p><p>Moreover, further visitor data such as location, search history, YouTube history and data about your actions on our website are collected in Google Analytics. As a result, we receive improved advertising reports and more useful information on your interests and demographic characteristics. These include your age, the language you speak, where you live or what your gender is. Certain social criteria such as your job, your marital status or your income are also included. All these characteristics help Google Analytics to define groups of persons or target audiences.</p><p>Those reports also help us to better assess your behaviour, as well as your wishes and interests. As a result, we can optimise and customise our products and services for you. By default, this data expires after 26 months. Please consider, that this data is only collected if you have agreed to personalised advertisement in your Google Account. The retained information is always exclusively summarised and anonymous data, and never any data on individual persons. You can manage or delete this data in your Google Account.</p><p><strong>Google Analytics in Consent Mode</strong></p><p>Depending on your consent, Google Analytics will progress your personal data in the so-called \u201cconsent mode\u201d. You can choose whether or not you want to accept Google Analytics cookies, and thus which of your data Google Analytics may process. The retained data is mainly used to measure user behaviour on the website, to serve targeted advertising and to provide us with web analysis reports. Usually, you would consent to Google\u2019s data processing via a cookie consent tool. If you do not consent to data processing, only aggregated data will be collected and processed. This means that data cannot be assigned to individual users and therefore no user profile will be created for you. You also have the option to only agree to statistical measurement, meaning that none of your personal data will be processed and used for advertising or advertising measurement sequences.</p><p><strong>Google Analytics IP Anonymisation</strong></p><p>We implemented Google Analytics\u2019 IP address anonymisation to this website. Google developed this function, so this website can comply with the applicable privacy laws and the local data protection authorities\u2019 recommendations, should they prohibit the retention of any full IP addresses.<br>The anonymisation or masking of IP addresses takes place, as soon as they reach Google Analytics\u2019 data collection network, but before the data would be saved or processed.</p><p>You can find more information on IP anonymisation at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en\">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en</a>.</p><p><strong>Google Remarketing Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>We use Google Remarketing, an advertising analysis tool, for our website.

(1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) for our website.<br>This Tag Manager is one of Google\u2019s many helpful marketing products. With it, we can centrally integrate and manage code sections of various tracking tools, that we use on our website.</p><p>In this privacy statement we will explain in more detail, what Google Tag Manager does, why we use it and to what extent your data is processed.</p><p>Google Tag Manager is an organising tool with which we can integrate and manage website tags centrally and via a user interface. Tags are little code sections which e.g. track your activities on our website. For this, segments of JavaScript code are integrated to our site\u2019s source text. The tags often come from Google\u2019s intern products, such as Google Ads or Google Analytics, but tags from other companies can also be integrated and managed via the manager. Since the tags have different tasks, they can collect browser data, feed marketing tools with data, embed buttons, set cookies and track users across several websites.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Google Tag Manager for our website?</strong></p><p>Everybody knows: Being organised is important! Of course, this also applies to maintenance of our website. In order to organise and design our website as well as possible for you and anyone who is interested in our products and services, we rely on various tracking tools, such as Google Analytics.<br>The collected data shows us what interests you most, which of our services we should improve, and which other persons we should also display our services to. Furthermore, for this tracking to work, we must implement relevant JavaScript Codes to our website. While we could theoretically integrate every code section of every tracking tool separately into our source text, this would take too much time and we would lose overview. This is the reason why we use Google Tag Manager. We can easily integrate the necessary scripts and manage them from one place. Additionally, Google Tag Manager\u2019s user interface is easy to operate, and requires no programming skills. Therefore, we can easily keep order in our jungle of tags.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by Google Tag Manager?</strong></p><p>Tag Manager itself is a domain that neither uses cookies nor stores data. It merely functions as an \u201cadministrator\u201c of implemented tags. Data is collected by the individual tags of the different web analysis tools. Therefore, in Google Tag Manager the data is sent to the individual tracking tools and does not get saved.</p><p>However, with the integrated tags of different web analysis tools such as Google Analytics, this is quite different. Depending on the analysis tool used, various data on your internet behaviour is collected, stored and processed with the help of cookies. Please read our texts on data protection for more information on the articular analysis and tracking tools we use on our website.</p><p>We allowed Google via the account settings for the Tag Manager to receive anonymised data from us. However, this exclusively refers to the use of our Tag Manager and not to your data, which are saved via code sections. We allow Google and others, to receive selected data in anonymous form. Therefore, we agree to the anonymised transfer of our website data. However, even after extensive research we could not find out what summarised and anonymous data it is exactly that gets transmitted. What we do know is that Google deleted any info that could identify our website. Google combines the data with hundreds of other anonymous website data and creates user trends as part of benchmarking measures. Benchmarking is a process of comparing a company\u2019s results with the ones of competitors. As a result, processes can be optimised based on the collected information.</p><p><strong>How long and where is the data stored?</strong></p><p>When Google stores data, this is done on Google\u2019s own servers. These servers are located all over the world, with most of them being in America. At <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en\">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en</a> you can read in detail where Google\u2019s servers are.</p><p>In our individual data protection texts on the different tools you can find out how long the respective tracking tools store your data.</p><p><strong>How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</strong></p><p>Google Tag Manager itself does not set any cookies but manages different tracking websites\u2019 tags. In our data protection texts on the different tracking tools you can find detailed information on how you can delete or manage your data.</p><p>Please note that when using this tool, your data may also be stored and processed outside the EU. Most third countries (including the USA) are not considered secure under current European data protection law. Data must not be transferred, stored and processed to insecure third countries, unless there are suitable guarantees (such as EU standard contractual clauses) between us and the non-European service provider.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>The use of the Google Tag Manager requires your consent, which we obtained via our cookie popup.

After you have registered for our newsletter on our website, you will receive an email, via which you can confirm the newsletter registration. This ensures that you own the email address you signed up with, and prevents anyone to register with a third-party email address. We or a notification tool we use, will log every single registration. This is necessary so we can ensure and prove, that registration processes are done legally and correctly. In general, the time of registration and registration confirmation are stored, as well as your IP address. Moreover, any change you make to your data that we have on file is also logged.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Email-Marketing?</strong></p><p>Of course, we want to stay in contact with you and keep you in the loop of the most important news about our company. For this, we use email marketing \u2013 often just referred to as \u201cnewsletters\u201d \u2013 as an essential part of our online marketing. If you agree to this or if it is permitted by law, we will send you newsletters, system emails or other notifications via email. Whenever the term \u201cnewsletter\u201d is used in the following text, it mainly refers to emails that are sent regularly. We of course don\u2019t want to bother you with our newsletter in any way. Thus, we genuinely strive to offer only relevant and interesting content. In our emails you can e.g. find out more about our company and our services or products.

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, Salesforce commits to maintaining the European data protection level when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission.

For us to be able to target interested users via social networks, user data may be processed. Additionally, elements of social media platforms may be embedded directly in our website. This is e.g. the case if you click a so-called social button on our website and are forwarded directly to our social media presence. So-called social media are websites and apps on which registered members can produce and exchange content with other members, be it openly or in certain groups and networks.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Social Media?</strong></p><p>For years, social media platforms have been the place where people communicate and get into contact online. With our social media presence, we can familiarise interested people better with our products and services. The social media elements integrated on our website help you switch to our social media content quickly and hassle free.</p><p>The data that is retained and processed when you use a social media channel is primarily used to conduct web analyses. The aim of these analyses is to be able to develop more precise and personal marketing and advertising strategies. The evaluated data on your behaviour on any social media platform can help to draw appropriate conclusions about your interests. Moreover, so-called user profiles can be created. Thus, the platforms may also to present you with customised advertisements. For this, cookies are usually placed in your browser, which store data on your user behaviour.</p><p>We generally assume that we will continue to be responsible under Data Protection Law, even when using the services of a social media platform. However, the European Court of Justice has ruled that, within the meaning of Art. 26 GDPR, in certain cases the operator of the social media platform can be jointly responsible with us. Should this be the case, we will point it out separately and work on the basis of a related agreement. You will then find the essence of the agreement for the concerned platform below.</p><p>Please note that when you use social media platforms or our built-in elements, your data may also be processed outside the European Union, as many social media channels, such as Facebook or Twitter, are American companies. As a result, you may no longer be able to easily claim or enforce your rights regarding your personal data.</p><p><strong>Which data are processed?</strong></p><p>Exactly which data are stored and processed depends on the respective provider of the social media platform. But usually it is data such as telephone numbers, email addresses, data you enter in contact forms, user data such as which buttons you click, what you like or who you follow, when you visited which pages, as well as information about your device and IP address. Most of this data is stored in cookies. Should you have a profile on the social media channel you are visiting and are logged in, data may be linked to your profile.</p><p>All data that are collected via social media platforms are also stored on the providers\u2019 servers. This means that only the providers have access to the data and can provide you with appropriate information or make changes for you.</p><p>If you want to know exactly which data is stored and processed by social media providers and how you can object to the data processing, we recommend you to carefully read the privacy policy of the respective company. We also recommend you to contact the provider directly if you have any questions about data storage and data processing or if you want to assert any corresponding rights.</p><p><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></p><p>Provided we have any further information on this, we will inform you about the duration of the data processing below. The social media platform Facebook example stores data until they are no longer needed for the company\u2019s own purposes. However, customer data that is synchronised with your own user data is erased within two days. Generally, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. This storage period can also be exceeded however, if it is required by law, such as e.g. in the case of accounting.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You also retain the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers such as embedded social media elements at any time. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. You can e.g. also prevent data collection via cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing cookies in your browser.</p><p>Since cookies may be used with social media tools, we also recommend you to read our privacy policy on cookies. If you want to find out which of your data is stored and processed, we advise you to read the privacy policies of the respective tools.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>If you have consented to the processing and storage of your data by integrated social media elements, this consent serves as the legal basis for data processing <strong>(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR)</strong>. Generally, provided you have given your consent, your data will also be stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest <strong>(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) </strong>in maintaining fast and good communication with you and other customers and business partners. Nevertheless, we only use the tools if you have consented. Most social media platforms also set cookies on your browser to store data.

Facebook is a social media network of the company Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland. With the aid of this tool we can provide the best possible offers to you and anyone interested in our products and services.</p><p>If your data is collected and forwarded via our embedded Facebook elements or via our Facebook page (fanpage), both we and Facebook Ireland Ltd. are responsible for this. However, should any further processing occur, then Facebook is solely responsible for this data. Our joint commitments were also set out in a publicly available agreement at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum\">https://www.facebook. com / legal / controller_addendum </a>. It e.g. states that we must clearly inform you about the use of Facebook tools on our website. We are also responsible for ensuring that the tools are securely integrated into our website and are in accordance with the applicable privacy laws. Facebook, on the other hand, is e.g. responsible for the data security of Facebook\u2019s products. If you have any questions about Facebook\u2019s data collection and processing, you can contact the company directly. Should you direct the question to us, we are obliged to forward it to Facebook.</p><p>In the following we will give you an overview on the different Facebook tools, as well as on what data is sent to Facebook and how you can erase this data.</p><p>Along with many other products, Facebook also offers so called \u201cFacebook Business Tools\u201d. This is Facebook\u2019s official name for its tools, but it is not very common. Therefore, we decided to merely call them \u201cFacebook tools\u201d. They include the following:</p><ul><li>Facebook-Pixel</li><li>Social Plugins (e.g. the \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cShare\u201c button)</li><li>Facebook Login</li><li>Account Kit</li><li>APIs (application programming interface)</li><li>SDKs (Softwart developmept kits)</li><li>Plattform-integrations</li><li>Plugins</li><li>Codes</li><li>Specifications</li><li>Documentations</li><li>Technologies and Services</li></ul><p>With these tools Facebook can extend its services and is able to receive information on user activities outside of Facebook.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?</strong></p><p>We only want to show our services and products to people who are genuinely interested in them. With the help of advertisements (Facebook Ads) we can reach exactly these people. However, to be able to show suitable adverts to users, Facebook requires additional information on people\u2019s needs and wishes. Therefore, information on the user behaviour (and contact details) on our website, are provided to Facebook. Consequently, Facebook can collect better user data and is able to display suitable adverts for our products or services. Thanks to the tools it is possible to create targeted, customised ad campaigns of Facebook.</p><p>Facebook calls data about your behaviour on our website \u201cevent data\u201d and uses them for analytics services. That way, Facebook can create \u201ccampaign reports\u201d about our ad campaigns\u2019 effectiveness on our behalf. Moreover, by analyses we can get a better insight in how you use our services, our website or our products. Therefore, some of these tools help us optimise your user experience on our website. With the social plugins for instance, you can share our site\u2019s contents directly on Facebook.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by Facebook tools?</strong></p><p>With the use of Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) may be sent to Facebook. Depending on the tools used, customer data such as name, address, telephone number and IP address may be transmitted.</p><p>Facebook uses this information to match the data with the data it has on you (if you are a Facebook member). However, before the customer data is transferred to Facebook, a so called \u201cHashing\u201d takes place. This means, that a data record of any size is transformed into a string of characters, which also has the purpose of encrypting data.</p><p>Moreover, not only contact data, but also \u201cevent data\u201c is transferred. These data are the information we receive about you on our website. To give an example, it allows us to see what subpages you visit or what products you buy from us. Facebook does not disclose the obtained information to third parties (such as advertisers), unless the company has an explicit permission or is legally obliged to do so. Also, \u201cevent data\u201c can be linked to contact information, which helps Facebook to offer improved, customised adverts. Finally, after the previously mentioned matching process, Facebook deletes the contact data.</p><p>To deliver optimised advertisements, Facebook only uses event data, if they have been combined with other data (that have been collected by Facebook in other ways). Facebook also uses event data for the purposes of security, protection, development and research. Many of these data are transmitted to Facebook via cookies. Cookies are little text files, that are used for storing data or information in browsers. Depending on the tools used, and on whether you are a Facebook member, a different number of cookies are placed in your browser. In the descriptions of the individual Facebook tools we will go into more detail on Facebook cookies. You can also find general information about the use of Facebook cookies at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies?tid=122472826\">https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies</a>.</p><p><strong>How long and where are the data stored?</strong></p><p>Facebook fundamentally stores data, until they are no longer of use for their own services and products. Facebook has servers for storing their data all around the world. However, customer data is cleared within 48 hours after they have been matched with their own user data.</p><p><strong>How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?</strong></p><p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data.</p><p>The collected data is only fully deleted, when you delete your entire Facebook account. Deleting your Facebook account works as follows:</p><p>1) Click on settings in the top right side in Facebook.</p><p>2) Then, click \u201cYour Facebook information\u201c in the left column.</p><p>3) Now click on \u201cDeactivation and deletion\u201d.</p><p>4) Choose \u201cPermanently delete account\u201c and then click on \u201cContinue to account deletion\u201c.</p><p>5) Enter your password, click on \u201ccontinue\u201c and then on \u201cDelete account\u201c.</p><p>The retention of data Facebook receives via our site is done via cookies (e.g. with social plugins), among others.

You can recognise these buttons by the classic Facebook logo, the \u201cLike\u201d button (hand with raised thumb) or by a \u201cFacebook plugin\u201d label. A social plugin is a small part of Facebook that is integrated into our page. Each plugin has its own function. The most used functions are the well-known \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cShare\u201d buttons.</p><p>Facebook offers the following social plugins:</p><ul><li>\u201cSave\u201d button</li><li>\u201cLike\u201d button, Share, Send and Quote</li><li>Page plugin</li><li>Comments</li><li>Messenger plugin</li><li>Embedded posts and video player</li><li>Group Plugin</li></ul><p>At <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins\">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins</a> you will find more information on how the individual plugins are used. On the one hand, we use the social plug-ins to offer you a better user experience on our site, and on the other hand because Facebook can optimise our advertisements with it.</p><p>If you have a Facebook account or have already visited <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">facebook.com</a>, Facebook has already placed at least one cookie in your browser. In this case, your browser sends information to Facebook via this cookie as soon as you visit our website or interact with social plugins (e.g. the \u201cLike\u201d button).</p><p>The received information will be deleted or anonymised within 90 days. According to Facebook, this data includes your IP address, the websites you have visited, the date, time and other information relating to your browser.</p><p>In order to prevent Facebook from collecting much data and matching it with your Facebook data during your visit to our website, you must log out of Facebook while you visit our website.</p><p>If you are not logged in to Facebook or do not have a Facebook account, your browser sends less information to Facebook because you have fewer Facebook cookies. Nevertheless, data such as your IP address or which website you are visiting can be transmitted to Facebook. We would like to explicitly point out that we do not know what exact data is collected. However, based on our current knowledge, we want to try informing you as best we can about data processing.

Instagram is a social media platform of the company Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Rd, Menlo Park CA 94025, USA. Since 2012, Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook Inc. and is a part of Facebook\u2019s products. The inclusion of Instagram\u2019s contents on our website is called embedding. With this, we can show you Instagram contents such as buttons, photos or videos directly on our website. If you open websites of our online presence, that have an integrated Instagram function, data gets transmitted to, as well as stored and processed by Instagram. Instagram uses the same systems and technologies as Facebook. Therefore, your data will be processed across all Facebook firms.</p><p>In the following, we want to give you a more detailed insight on why Instagram collects data, what data these are and how you can control data processing. As Instagram belongs to Facebook Inc., we have, on the one hand received this information from the Instagram guidelines, and on the other hand from Facebook\u2019s Data Policy.</p><p>Instagram is one of the most famous social media networks worldwide. Instagram combines the benefits of a blog with the benefits of audio-visual platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. To \u201cInsta\u201c (how the platform is casually called by many users) you can upload photos and short videos, edit them with different filters and also share them to other social networks. Also, if you do not want to be active on Instagram yourself, you can just follow other interesting users.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Instagram on our website?</strong></p><p>Instagram is a social media platform whose success has skyrocketed within recent years. Naturally, we have also reacted to this boom. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible on our website. Therefore, we attach great importance to diversified contents. With the embedded Instagram features we can enrich our content with helpful, funny or exciting Instagram contents. Since Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook, the collected data can also serve us for customised advertising on Facebook. Hence, only persons who are genuinely interested in our products or services can see our ads.</p><p>Instagram also uses the collected data for tracking and analysis purposes. We receive summarised statistics and therefore more insight to your wishes and interests. It is important to mention that these reports do not identify you personally.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by Instagram?</strong></p><p>Whenever you land on one of our sites, which have Instagram functions (i.e. Instagram photos or plugins) integrated to them, your browser automatically connects with Instagram\u2019s servers. Thereby, data is sent to, as well as saved and processed by Instagram. This always happens, whether you have an Instagram account or not. Moreover, it includes information on our website, your computer, your purchases, the advertisements you see and on how you use our offer. The date and time of your interaction is also stored. If you have an Instagram account or are logged in, Instagram saves significantly more data on you.</p><p>Facebook distinguishes between customer data and event data. We assume this is also the case for Instagram. Customer data are for example names, addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses. These data are only transmitted to Instagram, if they have been \u201chashed\u201d first. Thereby, a set of data is transformed into a string of characters, which encrypts any contact data. Moreover, the aforementioned \u201cevent data\u201c (data on your user behaviour) is transmitted as well. It is also possible, that contact data may get combined with event data. The collected data data is matched with any data Instagram already has on you.</p><p>Furthermore, the gathered data are transferred to Facebook via little text files (cookies) which usually get set in your browser. Depending on the Instagram function used, and whether you have an Instagram account yourself, the amount of data that gets stored varies.</p><p>We assume data processing on Instagram works the same way as on Facebook. Therefore, if you have an account on Instagram or have visited <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.instagram.com/?tid=122472826\">www.instagram.com</a>, Instagram has set at least one cookie. If this is the case, your browser uses the cookie to send information to Instagram, as soon as you come across an Instagram function. No later than 90 days (after matching) the data is deleted or anonymised. Even though we have studied Instagram\u2019s data processing in-depth, we cannot tell for sure what exact data Instagram collects and retains.</p><p>In the following we will show you a list of the least cookies placed in your browser when click on an Instagram function (e.g. button or an Insta picture). In our test we assume you do not have an Instagram account, since if you would be logged in to your Instagram account, your browser would place significantly more cookies.</p><p>The following cookies were used in our test:</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>csrftoken<br><strong>Value: </strong>\u201c\u201d<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>This cookie is most likely set for security reasons to prevent falsifications of requests.

The cookies that are placed in each individual case, depend on the functions embedded as well as on your use of Instagram.</p><p><strong>How long and where are these data stored?</strong></p><p>Instagram shares the information obtained within the Facebook businesses with external partners and persons you are globally connected with. Data processing is done according to Facebook\u2019s internal data policy. Your data is distributed to Facebook\u2019s servers across the world, partially for security reasons. Most of these servers are in the USA.</p><p><strong>How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?</strong></p><p>Thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data. Furthermore, you can manage your data in Instagram\u2019s settings. If you want to delete your data on Instagram completely, you will have to delete your Instagram account permanently.</p><p>And this is how an Instagram account can be deleted:</p><p>First, open the Instagram app. Then, navigate to your profile page, select the three bars in the top right, choose \u201cSettings\u201d and then click \u201cHelp\u201d. Now, you will be redirected to the company\u2019s website, where you must click on \u201cManaging Your Account\u201d and then \u201cDelete Your Account\u201d.</p><p>When you delete your account completely, Instagram deletes posts such as your photos and status updates. Any information other people shared about you are not a part of your account and do therefore not get deleted.</p><p>As mentioned before, Instagram primarily stores your data via cookies. You can manage, deactivate or delete these cookies in your browser. Depending on your browser, managing them varies a bit.

Social plugins can be feeds, content sharing or a link to our LinkedIn page. Social plugins are clearly marked with the well-known LinkedIn logo and for example allow sharing interesting content directly via our website. Moreover, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company Wilton Place in Dublin is responsible for data processing in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.</p><p>By embedding these plugins, data can be sent to, as well as stored and processed by LinkedIn. In this privacy policy we want to inform you what data this is, how the network uses this data and how you can manage or prevent data retention.</p><p>LinkedIn is the largest social network for business contacts. In contrast to e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn focuses exclusively on establishing business connections. Therefore, companies can present services and products on the platform and establish business relationships. Many people also use LinkedIn to find a job or to find suitable employees for their own company. In Germany alone, the network has over 11 million members. In Austria there are about 1.3 million.</p><p><strong>Why do we use LinkedIn on our website?</strong></p><p>We know how busy you are. You just cannot keep up with following every single social media channel. Even if it would really be worth it, as it is with our channels, since we keep posting interesting news and articles worth spreading. Therefore, on our website we have created the opportunity to share interesting content directly on LinkedIn, or to refer directly to our LinkedIn page. We consider built-in social plugins as an extended service on our website. The data LinkedIn collects also help us to display potential advertising measures only to people who are interested in our offer.</p><p><strong>What data are stored by LinkedIn?</strong></p><p>LinkedIn stores no personal data due to the mere integration of social plugins. LinkedIn calls the data generated by plugins passive impressions. However, if you click on a social plugin to e.g. share our content, the platform stores personal data as so-called \u201cactive impressions\u201d. This happens regardless of whether you have a LinkedIn account or not. If you are logged in, the collected data will be assigned to your account.</p><p>When you interact with our plugins, your browser establishes a direct connection to LinkedIn\u2019s servers. Through that, the company logs various usage data. These may include your IP address, login data, device information or information about your internet or cellular provider. If you use LinkedIn services via your smartphone, your location may also be identified (after you have given permission). Moreover, LinkedIn can share these data with third-party advertisers in \u201chashed\u201d form. Hashing means that a data set is transformed into a character string. This allows data to be encrypted, which prevents persons from getting identified.</p><p>Most data on of your user behaviour is stored in cookies. These are small text files that usually get placed in your browser. Furthermore, LinkedIn can also use web beacons, pixel tags, display tags and other device recognitions.</p><p>Various tests also show which cookies are set when a user interacts with a social plug-in. We do not claim for the information we found to be exhaustive, as it only serves as an example. The following cookies were set without being logged in to LinkedIn:</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> bcookie<br><strong>Value:</strong> =2&amp;34aab2aa-2ae1-4d2a-8baf-c2e2d7235c16122472826-<br><strong>Purpose:&nbsp;</strong>This cookie is a so-called \u201cbrowser ID cookie\u201d and stores your identification number (ID).<br><strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> lang<br><strong>Value:</strong> v=2&amp;lang=en-gb<br><strong>Purpose:</strong>This cookie saves your default or preferred language.<br><strong>Expiry date:</strong> after end of session</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> lidc<br><strong>Value:</strong> 1818367:t=1571904767:s=AQF6KNnJ0G122472826\u2026<br><strong>Purpose:</strong>This cookie is used for routing.

LinkedIn describes it as a secure browser ID cookie.<br><strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> fid<br><strong>Value:</strong> AQHj7Ii23ZBcqAAAA\u2026<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> We could not find any further information about this cookie.<br><strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 7 days</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> LinkedIn also works with third parties. That is why we identified the Google Analytics cookies _ga and _gat in our test.</p><p><strong>How long and where are the data stored?</strong></p><p>In general, LinkedIn retains your personal data for as long as the company considers it necessary for providing its services. However, LinkedIn deletes your personal data when you delete your account. In some exceptional cases, LinkedIn keeps some summarised and anonymised data, even account deletions. As soon as you delete your account, it may take up to a day until other people can no longer see your data. LinkedIn generally deletes the data within 30 days. However, LinkedIn retains data if it is necessary for legal reasons. Also, data that can no longer be assigned to any person remains stored even after the account is closed. The data are stored on various servers in America and presumably also in Europe.</p><p><strong>How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</strong></p><p>You have the right to access and delete your personal data at any time. In your LinkedIn account you can manage, change and delete your data. Moreover, you can request a copy of your personal data from LinkedIn.</p><p>How to access account data in your LinkedIn profile:</p><p>In LinkedIn, click on your profile icon and select the \u201cSettings &amp; Privacy\u201d section. Now click on \u201cPrivacy\u201d and then on the section \u201cHow LinkedIn uses your data on\u201d. Then, click \u201cChange\u201d in the row with \u201cManage your data and activity\u201d. There you can instantly view selected data on your web activity and your account history.</p><p>In your browser you also have the option of preventing data processing by LinkedIn. As mentioned above, LinkedIn stores most data via cookies that are placed in your browser. You can manage, deactivate or delete these cookies. Depending on which browser you have, these settings work a little different.

For the European area, the entity responsible for all aspects of privacy is the Irish company Pinterest Europe Ltd. (Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland).</p><p>Pinterest is a social network that specialises in graphic representations and photographs. Its name is made up of the two words \u201cpin\u201d and \u201cinterest\u201d. Users can exchange ideas about various hobbies and interests via Pinterest and view profiles with pictures openly or in defined groups.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Pinterest?</strong></p><p>The social media platform Pinterest has been around for a few years now and is still one of the most visited and valued platforms. Pinterest is particularly suitable for our industry because the platform is primarily known for beautiful and interesting images. That is why we are of course also represented on Pinterest and want to put our content in the limelight in places other than our website. The collected data may also be used for advertising purposes, so we can show advertising messages to precisely those people who are interested in our services or products.</p><p><strong>Which data are processed by Pinterest?</strong></p><p>Pinterest may store so-called log data. This includes information about your browser, IP address, our website address and the your activities on it (e.g. when you click the save or pin button), along with your search history, the date and time of the request as well as cookie and device data. If you interact with an embedded Pinterest function, cookies that store various data may also be set in your browser. Most of the above-mentioned log data, as well as preset language settings and clickstream data are stored in cookies. Pinterest considers clickstream data as information about your website behaviour.</p><p>If you have a Pinterest account yourself and are logged in, the data collected via our site may be linked to your account and used for advertising purposes. If you interact with our integrated Pinterest functions, you will usually be redirected to the Pinterest page. Below you will see an exemplary selection of cookies that can then be placed in your browser.</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>_auth<br><strong>Value: </strong>0<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>The cookie is used for authentication.

As soon as the storage of this data is no longer necessary, e.g. for the compliance with legal regulations, the data is either erased or anonymised so you can no longer be identified as a person. The data may also be stored on American servers.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You also have the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers such as Pinterest at any time. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. You can for example also prevent data retention by cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing cookies in your browser.</p><p>Since cookies can be used with embedded Pinterest elements, we also recommend you to read our general privacy policy on cookies. To find out which of your data are stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies of the respective tools.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>If you have consented to the processing and storage of you data by integrated social media elements, this consent is the legal basis for data processing <strong>(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR)</strong>.

The service provider is the Chinese company Beijing Bytedance Technology Ltd. For the European region, the responsible entity is the Irish company TikTok Technology Limited, 10 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, D02 T380, Ireland. TikTok is a popular social media platform, especially among young people, where users can create, share, and view short video clips.</p><p>In this privacy policy, we inform you about the data processed by TikTok, how long the data is stored, and how you can manage your privacy settings.</p><p><strong>Why do we use TikTok on our website?</strong></p><p>We have incorporated TikTok into our website so that you can watch TikTok videos if you wish and potentially interact with the videos. TikTok is known for its funny and creative content, and naturally, we don\u2019t want to withhold such content from you. After all, we also enjoy watching creative TikTok videos ourselves.</p><p><strong>What data is processed by TikTok?</strong></p><p>When you watch TikTok videos on our website or interact with them, TikTok may collect information about your usage behavior and your device. This may include data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, location, and other technical information. TikTok may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect information and personalize your user experience.</p><p>If you have a TikTok account, additional information may be collected and processed. This includes user information (such as name, birthdate, or email address) and data about your communication with other TikTok users.</p><p><strong>How long and where are the data stored?</strong></p><p>The storage duration and locations of the data collected by TikTok can vary significantly and are subject to TikTok\u2019s privacy policies. TikTok may also store data on servers in the United States and other countries. The storage duration typically complies with applicable legal requirements and internal policies. However, we have not been able to determine the exact duration of data storage. We will inform you as soon as we have more information on this matter.</p><p><strong>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</strong></p><p>If you have a TikTok account, you can manage your privacy settings directly on TikTok. For example, in the settings of your TikTok account, you can specify which information can be shared and which cannot. Additionally, you can manage and disable cookies in your web browser to limit data collection. This is also possible without a TikTok account. However, please note that this may affect the functionality of our website and your TikTok experience.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>If you have consented to TikTok processing and storing your data, this consent serves as the legal basis for data processing (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). In general, your data is also stored and processed based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in effective and efficient communication with you or other customers and business partners. However, we only use embedded social media elements if you have given your consent. TikTok may also set cookies in your browser to store data. Therefore, we recommend that you read our cookie privacy text carefully and view the privacy policy or cookie policies of the respective service provider.</p><p>TikTok processes data from you, including in the United States. We would like to inform you that, according to the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfer to the United States. This may entail various risks for the legality and security of data processing.</p><p>As the basis for data processing with recipients based in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, especially in the United States) or data transfers to such countries, TikTok uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (= Art. 46 para. 2 and 3 GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are model templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the United States).

These include embedded tweets, timelines, buttons, or hashtags, for example. X is a short messaging service and social media platform provided by the American company X Corp., located at 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. For the European region, Twitter International Unlimited Company (One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, D02 AX07, Ireland) is responsible for processing personal data.</p><p>To our knowledge, in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, a mere integration of the X function does not transfer any personal data or data about your web activities to X. Only when you interact with the X functions, such as by clicking a button, data could be sent to X and get saved as well as processed there. We have no influence on this processing of data and do not bare any responsibility for it. Within this privacy statement, we want to give you an overview of what data X stores, what X does with this data and how you can largely protect yourself from data transmission.</p><p>For some, X is a news service, for others, a social media platform, and for others still it is a microblogging service. All these terms are justified and mean pretty much the same.</p><p>Both individuals as well as companies use X for communicating with interested people via short messages. X only allows 280 characters per message. These messages are called \u201ctweets\u201d. In contrast to Facebook, for example, the service does not focus on the expansion of a network of \u201cfriends\u201d, but strives to be regarded as an open, worldwide news platform. On X you can also have an anonymous account and tweets can be deleted by both, either the company or the users themselves.</p><p><strong>Why do we use X on our website?</strong></p><p>Like many other websites and companies, we try to use different channels for offering our services and communicating with our customers. X is a truly useful \u201csmall\u201d news service, which is why it has grown dear to us. We regularly tweet or retweet exciting, funny or interesting content. We understand that you do not have the time to follow every channel after channel, as you surely have enough other things to do. That is why we also have integrated X functions to our website. That way, you can experience our X activities \u201con site\u201d or come to our X page via a direct link. With the integration, we want to strengthen the service and user-friendliness on our website.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by X?</strong></p><p>You will find integrated X functions on some of our subpages. If you interact with X content, such as by clicking a button, X may collect and save data. This can happen even if you don\u2019t have a X account yourself. X calls this data \u201clog data\u201d. It includes demographic data, browser cookie IDs, your smartphone\u2019s ID, hashed email addresses, and information on which pages you have visited on X and what actions you have taken there. Of course, X stores more data if you have a X account and are logged in. This retention is usually done via cookies. Cookies are small text files that are usually set in your browser and transmit various information to X.</p><p>We will now show you which cookies are placed if you are not logged in to X but visit a website with built-in X functions. Please consider this list as an example. We do not claim for this list to be extensive, since the array of cookies always changes and depends on your individual actions with X content.</p><p>The following cookies have been used in our test:</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> personalization_id<br><strong>Value:</strong> \u201cv1_cSJIsogU51SeE122472826\u201d<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>This cookie stores information on how you use the website and what ad may have led you to X.<br><strong>Expiry date: </strong>after 2 years</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>lang<br><strong>Value: </strong>en<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>This cookie stores your default or preferred language.<br><strong>Expiry date: </strong>after end of session</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>guest_id<br><strong>Value: </strong>122472826v1%3A157132626<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>This cookie is set to identify you as a guest.<br><strong>Expiry date: </strong>after 2 years</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>fm<br><strong>Value: </strong>0<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>Unfortunately, we could not find out the purpose of this cookie.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Expiry date: </strong>after end of session</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>external_referer<br><strong>Value: </strong>1224728262beTA0sf5lkMrlGt<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>This cookie collects anonymous data, such as how often you visit X and how long you visit X.<br><strong>Expiry date: </strong>after 6 days</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>eu_cn<br><strong>Value: </strong>1<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>This cookie stores user activity and is used for X\u2019s various advertising purposes.<br><strong>Expiry date: </strong>after one year</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>ct0<br><strong>Value: </strong>c1179f07163a365d2ed7aad84c99d966<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>Unfortunately we could not find any information on this cookie.<br><strong>Expiry date: </strong>after 6 hours</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>_twitter_sess<br><strong>Value: </strong>53D%253D\u2013dd0248122472826-<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>With this cookie you can use functions within X\u2019s website.<br><strong>Expiry date: </strong>after end of session</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>X&nbsp;also works with third parties. Therefore, we have recognized the three Google Analytics cookies _ga, _gat, _gid in our test.</p><p>On the one hand, X uses the collected data for gaining better understand on user behaviour, and thus to improve their own services and advertising offers. On the other hand, the data are also used for internal security measures.</p><p><strong>How long and where are the data stored?</strong></p><p>When X collects data from other websites, after a maximum of 30 days, they will be deleted, summarised or otherwise concealed. X\u2019s servers are in various server centres in the United States. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the gathered data will be collected and stored in America. In our research we could not clearly determine whether X also owns servers in Europe. Generally, X may keep collected data stored until either the data are no longer useful to the company, until you delete the data or until a potential legal deletion period has been reached.</p><p><strong>How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?</strong></p><p>In their Privacy Policy, X repeatedly emphasise that they do not save data from external website visits, provided you or your browser are in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. However, if you interact directly with X, the company will of course store your data.</p><p>If you have a X account, you can manage your data by clicking on \u201cMore\u201d under the \u201cProfile\u201d button. Then click on \u201cSettings and privacy\u201d. Here you can manage data processing individually.</p><p>If you do not have a X account, you can go to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">twitter.com</a> and click \u201cSettings\u201d.

Their functions allow you to for example share content and follow interesting content on Xing directly via our website, or to log in to Xing via our site. You can recognize the plugins by the company name or the Xing logo. If you open a website that uses a Xing plugin, data can be transmitted to, and saved as well as evaluated by the \u201cXing server\u201d. In this privacy policy we will inform you on what data this is and how you can manage or prevent data retention.</p><p>Xing is a social network with its headquarters in Hamburg. The company specializes in managing professional contacts. That means, that as opposed to other networks, Xing is primarily about professional networking. The platform is often used for job hunting or for companies to find employees. Moreover, Xing offers interesting content on various professional topics. The global counterpart of Xing is the American company LinkedIn.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Xing on our website?</strong></p><p>Nowadays, there is a flood of social media channels, and we understand that your time is very precious. It is simply not possible for you to closely follow every social media channel of a company. Therefore, we want to make your life as easy as possible and enable you to share or follow interesting content on Xing directly via our website.

Furthermore, our Online Marketing measures aim to draw people\u2019s attention to our website. In order to be able to show our offer to many interested people, we do Online Marketing. It mostly is about online advertising, content marketing or search engine optimisation. For this, personal data is also stored and processed, to enable us to use Online Marketing efficiently and targeted. On the one hand, the data help us to only show our content to people who are interested in it. On the other hand, it helps us to measure the advertising success of our Online Marketing measures.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Online Marketing tools?</strong></p><p>We want to show our website to everyone who is interested in our offer. We are aware that this is not possible without conscious measures being taken. That is why we do Online Marketing. There are various tools that make working on our Online Marketing measures easier for us. These also provide suggestions for improvement via data. Thus, we can target our campaigns more precisely to our target group. The ultimate purpose of these Online Marketing tools is to optimise our offer.</p><p><strong>Which data are processed?</strong></p><p>For our Online Marketing to work and to measure its success, user profiles are created and data are e.g. stored in cookies (small text files). With the help of this data, we can not only advertise in the traditional way, but also present our content directly on our website in the way you prefer. There are various third-party tools that offer these functions and thus collect and store your data accordingly. The aforementioned cookies e.g. store the pages you visit on our website, how long you view these pages, which links or buttons you click or which website you came from. What is more, technical information may also be stored. This may include e.g. your IP address, the browser and device you use to visit our website or the time you accessed our website as well as the time you left. If you have agreed for us to determine your location, we can also store and process it.</p><p>Your IP address is stored in pseudonymised form (i.e. shortened). What is more, distinct data that directly identify you as a person, such as your name, address or email address, are only stored in pseudonymised for advertising and Online Marketing purposes. With this data we cannot identify you as a person and only retain the pseudonymised information that is stored in your user profile.</p><p>Under certain circumstances, cookies may also be utilised, analysed and used for advertising purposes on other websites that use the same advertising tools. Thus, your data may then also be stored on the servers of the respective provider of the advertising tool.</p><p>In rare exceptions, unique data (name, email address, etc.) may also be stored in the user profiles. This can happen, if you are for example a member of a social media channel that we use for our Online Marketing measures and if the network connects previously received data with the user profile.</p><p>We only ever receive summarised information from the advertising tools we use that do store data on their servers. We never receive data that can be used to identify you as an individual. What is more, the data only shows how well-placed advertising measures have worked. For example, we can see what measures have caused you or other users to visit our website and purchase a service or product. Based on these analyses we can improve our advertising offer in the future and adapt it more precisely to the needs and wishes of people who are interested.</p><p><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></p><p>Below we will inform you on the duration of data processing, provided we have this information. In general, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide our services and products. Data stored in cookies are retained for different lengths of time. Some cookies are deleted after you leave a website, while others may be stored in your browser for a number of years. However, in the respective privacy policies of the respective provider, you will usually find detailed information on the individual cookies this provider uses.</p><p><strong>Right of withdrawal</strong></p><p>You also retain the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. You can for example also prevent data collection by cookies if you manage, deactivate or erase cookies in your browser. The legality of the processing remains unaffected to the point of revocation.</p><p>Since Online Marketing tools usually use cookies, we also recommend you to read our privacy policy on cookies. If you want to find out which of your data is stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies of the respective tools.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>If you have consented to the use of third-party providers, then this consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent) </strong>, this consent is the legal basis for personal data processing, as may be done when data is collected by online marketing tools.</p><p>Moreover, we have a legitimate interest in measuring our online marketing activities in anonymised form, in order to use this data for optimising our offer and our Marketing. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests) </strong>. Nevertheless, we only use these tools if you have given your consent.</p><p>Information on special online marketing tools can be found in the following sections, provided this information is available.</p><p><strong>Facebook Custom Audiences Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>On our website we use Facebook Custom Audiences, a event tracking tool.

Thus, we want to draw more people\u2019s attention on the internet to the high quality of our offers. As part of our advertising measures with Google Ads, we use the conversion tracking of Google LLC., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\u201cGoogle\u201d) on our website. With the aid of this free tracking tool we can tailor our advertising offer better to your interests and needs. In the following article we will explain, why we use conversion tracking, what data gets saved and how you can prevent this data retention.</p><p>Google Ads (previously Google AdWords) is the internal online advertising sxstem of the company Google LLC. We are convinced of our offer\u2018s quality and would like as many people as possible to discover our website. For this, Google Ads offers the best platform within the online environment. Of course, we also want to get an overview of the cost-benefit factor of our advertising campaigns. Thence, we use Google Ads\u2019 conversion tracking tool.</p><p>But what is a conversion actually? A conversion occurs, when you turn from an interested visitor into an acting website visitor. This happens every time you click on our ad and then make another action, such as paying a visit to our website. With Google\u2019s conversion tracking tool, we can understand what happens after a user clicks our Google ad. It shows us for instance if products get bought, services are used or whether users have subscribed to our newsletter.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Google Ads conversion tracking on our website?</strong></p><p>We use Google Ads to show our offer also across other websites. Our aim is for our advertising campaigns to reach only those people, who are interested in our offers. With the conversion tracking tool, we see what keywords, ads, ad groups and campaigns lead to the desired customer actions. We see how many customers interact with our ads on a device, to then convert. With this data we can calculate our cost-benefit-factor, measure the success of individual ad campaigns and therefore optimise our online marketing measures. With the help of the obtained data we can give our website a more interesting design and customise our advertising offer better to your needs.</p><p><strong>What data is stored with Google Ads conversion tracking?</strong></p><p>For a better analysis of certain user actions, we have integrated a conversion tracking tag, or code snippet to our website. Therefore, if you click one of our Google ads, a Google domain stores the cookie \u201cconversion\u201d on your computer (usually in the browser) or on your mobile device. Cookies are little text files that save information on your computer.</p><p>Here are data of the most significant cookies for Google\u2019s conversion tracking:</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> Conversion<br><strong>Value:</strong> EhMI_aySuoyv4gIVled3Ch0llweVGAEgt-mr6aXd7dYlSAGQ122472826-3<br><strong>Purpose: </strong>This cookie saves every conversion you make on our website after you came to us via a Google ad.<br><strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 3 months</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> _gac<br><strong>Value:</strong> 1.1558695989.EAIaIQobChMIiOmEgYO04gIVj5AYCh2CBAPrEAAYASAAEgIYQfD_BwE<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> This is a classic Google Analytics Cookie that records various actions on our website.<br><strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 3 months</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The cookie _gac only appears in connection with Google Analytics. The above list does not claim to be exhaustive, as Google repeatedly change the cookies they use for analytical evaluation.</p><p>As soon as you complete an action on our website, Google identifies the cookie and saves your action as a so-called conversion. For as long as you surf our website, provided the cookie has not expired, both Google and us can determine that you found your way to us via a Google ad. Then, the cookie is read and sent back to Google Ads, together with the conversion data. Moreover, other cookies may also be used for measuring conversions. Google Ads\u2018 conversion tracking can be fine-tuned and improved with the aid of Google Analytics. Furthermore, ads which Google displays in various places across the web, might be placed under our domain with the name \u201c__gads\u201d or \u201c_gac\u201d.<br>Since September 2017, analytics.js retains various campaign information with the _gac cookie. This cookie stores data, as soon as you open one of our sites that has been set up for Google Ads\u2019 auto-tagging. In contrast to cookies that are placed for Google domains, Google can only read these conversion cookies when you are on our website. We do neither collect nor receive any personal data. We do obtain a report with statistical evaluations by Google. With the help thereof, we can not only see the total number of users who clicked our ad, but also what advertising measures were well received.</p><p><strong>How long and where is the data stored?</strong></p><p>At this point we want to reiterate, that we have no influence on how Google use the collected data. According to Google, the data are encrypted and stored on a secure server. In most cases, conversion cookies expire after 30 days, and do not transmit any personalised data. The cookies named \u201cconversion\u201c and \u201c_gac\u201c (which is used with Google Analytics) have an expiry date of 3 months.</p><p><strong>How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?</strong></p><p>You have the possibility to opt out of Google Ads\u2019 conversion tracking. The conversion tracking can be blocked by deactivating the conversion tracking cookie via your browser. If you do this, you will not be considered for the statistic of the tracking tool. You can change the cookie settings in your browser anytime. Doing so, works a little different in every browser.

With the help of Microsoft Advertising, we want to draw many people\u2019s attention to the high quality of our products and/or services. For this, we use a technology (conversion tracking tool) by Microsoft on our website, which also stores your data. In this privacy policy, we will go into more detail about this service, show you which of your data is stored, managed, and processed and how you can prevent this data retention.</p><p>Perhaps you know Microsoft Advertising by its former name \u201cBing Ads\u201d. It is an advertising program by Microsoft which is based on a Pay-Per-Click system. This means that advertisers can advertise through the search engines Bing and Yahoo! and only pay when a user clicks the ad.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Microsoft Advertising?</strong></p><p>We are convinced of our offers, and therefore, we of course want to show them to a wider public. With Microsoft Advertising, we can bring our products or services closer to precisely those people who are specifically interested in them. Moreover, we want to present our products not only on the famous search engine Google, but also on Bing and Yahoo! Microsoft Advertising also gives us the option of placing ads in the so-called \u201cMicrosoft Audience Network\u201d. This allows us to also place advertisements on LinkedIn for example. Furthermore, conversion tracking for example tells us, which advertisement you used to find us, which one of our subpages you particularly like and which actions you are taking on our website. This data enables us to tailor our website, our advertisements, and our offers much better to your needs.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by Microsoft Advertising?</strong></p><p>We have integrated a conversion tracking tag (i.e. a small code snippet) from Microsoft Advertising to our website. This snippet is known as the Universal Event Tracking (UET) tag. If you come to our website via a Microsoft advertisement, we can use this tracking tool to find out more about your user behaviour on our website. For example, we can find out which keyword or ad led you to us, what you clicked on our website, how long you stayed on our website, as well as how many people visit our website via Microsoft Ads. All these data relate to user behaviour but not to any personal information. In this sense, we only receive data or analyses of your web behaviour, but none of your personal information. Microsoft uses the data to optimise its own promotional offer as well as other services. If you have a Microsoft account yourself, the data collected may be linked to your account. Moreover, Microsoft might also recognise and store your IP address. To save all data on your user behaviour, the following cookie is set in your browser after you have visited our website via a Microsoft ad:</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>MUIDB<br><strong>Value: </strong>08A53CA3313F6255044C307E353F61CD<br><strong>Purpose:</strong>This cookie is set by our embedded Microsoft tag (UET tag) and is used for synchronisation purposes across various Microsoft websites.

The company are using various servers accross the world. Most of them are in the United States. Therefore, your data may also be stored, managed, and processed on American servers. Microsoft stores data (especially personal data) for as long as it is necessary for both, delivering their services or products and for legal purposes. Furthermore, Microsoft states that the actual time data are retained, depends on the respective product and may vary strongly.</p><p>Microsoft deletes your stored Bing search requests after 6 months by deleting your IP address.

This helps to load our website quickly and easily, regardless of your location. Moreover, your personal data will also be stored, managed and processed on the respective CDN provider\u2019s servers. In the following, we will go into more general detail on this service and the data processing associated with it. You can find detailed information on how your data is handled in the provider\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p><p>Each content delivery network (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers that are connected to each other via the internet. Through this network, website content (especially very large files) can be delivered quickly and smoothly, even when large loading peaks occur. To make this possible, CDNs create a copy of our website on their servers. The website can be delivered quickly because these servers are distributed all around the world. Any data transfer to your browser is therefore significantly shortened by the CDN.</p><p><strong>Why do we use a Content Delivery Network for our website?</strong></p><p>A fast loading website is part of our service. Of course, we know how annoying it is when a website loads at a snail\u2019s pace. Most of the time, you lose your patience and click away before the website is fully loaded. But of course we want to avoid that. Therefore, to us a fast loading website is an obligatory part of our website offer. With the use of a content delivery network, our website loads significantly faster in your browser. Furthermore, CDNs are particularly helpful when you are abroad, as the website is always delivered from a server in your area.</p><p><strong>Which data are processed?</strong></p><p>If you access a website or its content and it gets cached in a CDN, the CDN forwards the request to the server closest to you which then delivers the content. Content delivery networks are built in a way that JavaScript libraries can be downloaded and hosted on npm and Github servers. Alternatively, WordPress plugins can also be loaded on most CDNs, provided they are hosted on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a>. Moreover, your browser can send personal data to the content delivery network we use. This includes data such as IP addresses, browser type, browser version, the accessed website or the time and date of the page visit. This data is collected and stored by the CDN. Whether cookies are used for data storage depends on the network that is being used. For more information on this, please read the Privacy Policy of the respective service.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>If you want to prevent this data transfer altogether, you can use a JavaScript blocker (see for example <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://noscript.net/\">https://noscript.net/</a>) on your computer. However, our website can then of course no longer offer its usual service (such as a fast loading speeds).</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>If you have consented to the use of a content delivery network, your consent represents the the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to <strong>Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. a (consent)</strong> your consent represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as it can occur when collected by a content delivery network.</p><p>We also have a legitimate interest in using a content delivery network to optimise our online service and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. Nevertheless, we only use the tool if you have consented to it.</p><p>Provided this information is available, you can find out more about the particular content delivery networks in the following sections.</p><p><strong>Cloudflare Privacy Policy</strong></p><figure><p><strong>Cloudflare Privacy Policy Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors<br>\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: service performance optimisation (to accelerate website loading times)<br>\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: data such as IP address, contact and protocol information, security fingerprints and website performance data<br>You can find more details on this in the Privacy Policy below.<br>\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: most of the data is stored for less than 24 hours<br>\u2696\ufe0f Legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</p></figure><p><strong>What is Cloudflare?</strong></p><p>We use Cloudflare by the company Cloudflare, Inc. (101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) on our website to enhance its speed and security. For this, Cloudflare uses cookies and processes user data. Cloudflare, Inc. is an American company that offers a content delivery network and various security services. These services take place between the user and our hosting provider. In the following, we will try to explain in detail what all this means.</p><p>A content delivery network (CDN), as provided by Cloudflare, is nothing more than a network of servers that are connected to each other. Cloudflare has deployed servers around the world, which ensure websites can appear on your screen faster. Simply put, Cloudflare makes copies of our website and places them on its own servers. Thus, when you visit our website, a load distribution system ensures that the main part of our website is delivered by a server that can display our website to you as quickly as possible. The CDN significantly shortens the route of the transmitted data to your browser. Thus, Cloudflare does not only deliver our website\u2019s content from our hosting server, but from servers from all over the world. Cloudflare is particularly helpful for users from abroad, since pages can be delivered from a nearby server. In addition to the fast delivery of websites, Cloudflare also offers various security services, such as DDoS protection, or the web application firewall.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Cloudflare on our website?</strong></p><p>Of course, we want our website to offer you the best possible service. Cloudflare helps us make our website faster and more secure. Cloudflare offers us web optimisations as well as security services such as DDoS protection and a web firewall. Moreover, this includes a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Proxy\">Reverse-Proxy</a> and the content distribution network (CDN). Cloudflare blocks threats and limits abusive bots as well as crawlers that waste our bandwidth and server resources. By storing our website in local data centres and blocking spam software, Cloudflare enables us to reduce our bandwidth usage by about 60%. Furthermore, the provision of content through a data centre near you and certain web optimizations carried out there, cut the average loading time of a website in about half. According to Cloudflare, the setting \u201cI\u2019m Under Attack Mode\u201d can be used to mitigate further attacks by displaying a JavaScript calculation task that must be solved before a user can access a website. Overall, this makes our website significantly more powerful and less susceptible to spam or other attacks.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by Cloudflare?</strong></p><p>Cloudflare generally only transmits data that is controlled by website operators. Therefore, Cloudflare does not determine the content, but the website operator themselves does. Additionally, Cloudflare may collect certain information about the use of our website and may process data we send or data which Cloudflare has received certain instructions for. Mostly, Cloudflare receives data such as IP addresses, contacts and protocol information, security fingerprints and websites\u2019 performance data. Log data for example helps Cloudflare identify new threats. That way, Cloudflare can ensure a high level of security for our website. As part of their services, Cloudflare process this data in compliance with the applicable laws. Of course, this also includes the compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>Furthermore, Cloudflare uses a cookie for security reasons. The cookie (__cfduid) is used to identify individual users behind a shared IP address, and to apply security settings for each individual user. The cookie is very useful, if you e.g. use our website from a restaurant where several infected computers are located. However, if your computer is trustworthy, we can recognise that with the cookie. Hence, you will be able to freely and carelessly surf our website, despite the infected PCs in your area. Another point that is important to know, is that this cookie does not store any personal data. The cookie is essential for Cloudflare\u2019s security functions and cannot be deactivated.</p><p><strong>Cookies by Cloudflare</strong></p><p><strong>Name:</strong> __cfduid<br><strong>Value:</strong> d798bf7df9c1ad5b7583eda5cc5e78122472826-3<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> Security settings for each individual visitor<br><strong>Expiry date:</strong> after one year</p><p>Cloudflare also works with third party providers. They may however only process personal data after the instruction of Cloudflare and in accordance with the data protection guidelines and other confidentiality and security measures. Without explicit consent from us, Cloudflare will not pass on any personal data.</p><p><strong>How long and where is the data stored?</strong></p><p>Cloudflare stores your information primarily in the United States and the European Economic Area. Cloudflare can transfer and access the information described above, from all over the world. In general, Cloudflare stores domains\u2019 user-level data with the Free, Pro and Business versions for less than 24 hours. For enterprise domains that have activated Cloudflare Logs (previously called Enterprise LogShare or ELS), data can be stored for up to 7 days. However, if IP addresses trigger security warnings in Cloudflare, there may be exceptions to the storage period mentioned above.</p><p><strong>How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?</strong></p><p>Cloudflare only keeps data logs for as long as necessary and in most cases deletes the data within 24 hours. Cloudflare also does not store any personal data, such as your IP address. However, there is information that Cloudflare store indefinitely as part of their permanent logs. This is done to improve the overall performance of Cloudflare Resolver and to identify potential security risks. You can find out exactly which permanent logs are saved at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/\">https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/</a>. All data Cloudflare collects (temporarily or permanently) is cleared of all personal data. Cloudflare also anonymise all permanent logs.</p><p>In their privacy policy, Cloudflare state that they are not responsible for the content you receive. For example, if you ask Cloudflare whether you can update or delete content, Cloudflare will always refer to us as the website operator. You can also completely prevent the collection and processing of your data by Cloudflare, when you deactivate the execution of script-code in your browser, or if you integrate a script blocker to your browser.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>If you have consented to the use of Cloudflare, your consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to <strong>Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. a (Consent) </strong>your consent is the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as can occur when it is collected by Cloudflare.</p><p>We also have a legitimate interest in using Cloudflare to optimise our online service and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit.f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. Nevertheless, we only use Cloudflare if you have given your consent to it.</p><p>Cloudflare processes data from you, among other things, in the USA.

Spam includes advertising emails from mass mailings that you did not sign up for yourself. Such emails are also called data garbage and can also cause costs. Other spam such as phishing emails, on the other hand, are messages that aim to gain trust via fake messages or websites in order to obtain personal information. Anti-spam software usually protects against unwanted spam messages or malicious emails that could inject viruses into our system. We also use general firewall and security systems that protect our devices from unwanted network attacks.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Security &amp; Anti-spam software?</strong></p><p>We put great importance on our website\u2019s security. After all, this is not just about our safety, but also about your safety. Unfortunately, cyber threats are now part of everyday life in the world of IT and the internet. Hackers e. g. often try to steal personal data from IT systems with the help of cyber attacks. And therefore a good defence system is absolutely necessary. A security system monitors all incoming and outgoing connections to our network or computer. In order to achieve even greater security against cyber attacks, we also use other external security services on our devices in addition to standardised security systems. Unauthorised data transmissions are thus better prevented and this is how we protect ourselves from cybercrime.</p><p><strong>Which data are processed by Security &amp; Anti-spam software?</strong></p><p>The data that is collected and stored of course depends on the respective service. However, we always try to only use programs that collect data very sparingly or only store data that is necessary for the fulfilment of the offered service. In general, the service may store data such as name, address, IP address, email address and technical data such as browser type or browser version. Any performance and log data may also be collected in order to identify possible incoming threats in good time. This data will be processed as part of the provided services and in compliance with applicable laws. This also includes the GDPR for US providers (via the Standard Contractual Clauses). In some cases, security services also work with third parties who may store and/or process data under instructions and in accordance with privacy policies and other security measures. Data is usually stored using cookies.</p><p><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></p><p>We will inform you below about the duration of data processing, provided we have further information on this. For example, security programs store data until you or we revoke data storage. In general, personal data is only stored for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of the services. Unfortunately, in many cases, we do not have precise information from the providers about their data storage periods.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You also have the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party security software at any time. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing the cookies in your browser.</p><p>Since cookies may also be used with security services, we recommend you read our privacy policy on cookies. To find out exactly which of your data is stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies of the respective tools.</p><p><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p><p>We use security services mainly on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in a good security system and protection against various cyber attacks.</p><p>Certain data processing requires your consent \u2013 in particular, the use of cookies and security functions. If you have agreed to the processing and storage of your data by integrated security services, your consent is the legal basis for data processing (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Most of the services we use set cookies on your browser to store data. We, therefore, recommend you read our privacy policy on cookies carefully and consult the privacy policy or cookie policy of the relevant service provider.</p><p>Information on special tools \u2013 if available \u2013 can be found in the following sections.</p><p><strong>Google reCAPTCHA Privacy Policy</strong></p><figure><p><strong>Google reCAPTCHA Privacy Policy Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors<br>\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: Service optimisation and protection against cyber attacks<br>\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: data such as IP address, browser information, operating system, limited location and usage data<br>You can find more details on this in the Privacy Policy below.<br>\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: depending on the retained data<br>\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</p></figure><p><strong>What is reCAPTCHA?</strong></p><p>Our primary goal is to provide you an experience on our website that is as secure and protected as possible. To do this, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With reCAPTCHA we can determine whether you are a real person from flesh and bones, and not a robot or a spam software. By spam we mean any electronically undesirable information we receive involuntarily. Classic CAPTCHAS usually needed you to solve text or picture puzzles to check. But thanks to Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA you usually do have to do such puzzles. Most of the times it is enough to simply tick a box and confirm you are not a bot. With the new Invisible reCAPTCHA version you don\u2019t even have to tick a box. In this privacy policy you will find out how exactly this works, and what data is used for it.</p><p>reCAPTCHA is a free captcha service from Google that protects websites from spam software and misuse by non-human visitors. This service is used the most when you fill out forms on the Internet. A captcha service is a type of automatic Turing-test that is designed to ensure specific actions on the Internet are done by human beings and not bots. During the classic Turing-test (named after computer scientist Alan Turing), a person differentiates between bot and human. With Captchas, a computer or software program does the same. Classic captchas function with small tasks that are easy to solve for humans but provide considerable difficulties to machines. With reCAPTCHA, you no longer must actively solve puzzles. The tool uses modern risk techniques to distinguish people from bots. The only thing you must do there, is to tick the text field \u201cI am not a robot\u201d. However, with Invisible reCAPTCHA even that is no longer necessary. reCAPTCHA, integrates a JavaScript element into the source text, after which the tool then runs in the background and analyses your user behaviour. The software calculates a so-called captcha score from your user actions. Google uses this score to calculate the likelihood of you being a human, before entering the captcha. reCAPTCHA and Captchas in general are used every time bots could manipulate or misuse certain actions (such as registrations, surveys, etc.).</p><p><strong>Why do we use reCAPTCHA on our website?</strong></p><p>We only want to welcome people from flesh and bones on our side and want bots or spam software of all kinds to stay away. Therefore, we are doing everything we can to stay protected and to offer you the highest possible user friendliness. For this reason, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google. Thus, we can be pretty sure that we will remain a \u201cbot-free\u201d website. Using reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google to determine whether you genuinely are human. reCAPTCHA thus ensures our website\u2019s and subsequently your security. Without reCAPTCHA it could e.g. happen that a bot would register as many email addresses as possible when registering, in order to subsequently \u201cspam\u201d forums or blogs with unwanted advertising content. With reCAPTCHA we can avoid such bot attacks.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by reCAPTCHA?</strong></p><p>reCAPTCHA collects personal user data to determine whether the actions on our website are made by people. Thus, IP addresses and other data Google needs for its reCAPTCHA service, may be sent to Google. Within member states of the European Economic Area, IP addresses are almost always compressed before the data makes its way to a server in the USA. Moreover, your IP address will not be combined with any other of Google\u2019s data, unless you are logged into your Google account while using reCAPTCHA. Firstly, the reCAPTCHA algorithm checks whether Google cookies from other Google services (YouTube, Gmail, etc.) have already been placed in your browser. Then reCAPTCHA sets an additional cookie in your browser and takes a snapshot of your browser window.</p><p>The following list of collected browser and user data is not exhaustive. Rather, it provides examples of data, which to our knowledge, is processed by Google.</p><ul><li>Referrer URL (the address of the page the visitor has come from)</li><li>IP-address (z.B. 256.123.123.1)</li><li>Information on the operating system (the software that enables the operation of your computers. Popular operating systems are Windows, Mac OS X or Linux)</li><li>Cookies (small text files that save data in your browser)</li><li>Mouse and keyboard behaviour (every action you take with your mouse or keyboard is stored)</li><li>Date and language settings (the language and date you have set on your PC is saved)</li><li>All Javascript objects (JavaScript is a programming language that allows websites to adapt to the user. JavaScript objects can collect all kinds of data under one name)</li><li>Screen resolution (shows how many pixels the image display consists of)</li></ul><p>Google may use and analyse this data even before you click on the \u201cI am not a robot\u201d checkmark. In the Invisible reCAPTCHA version, there is no need to even tick at all, as the entire recognition process runs in the background. Moreover, Google have not given details on what information and how much data they retain.</p><p>The following cookies are used by reCAPTCHA: With the following list we are referring to Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA demo version at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo\">https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo</a>.<br>For tracking purposes, all these cookies require a unique identifier.

Google have not disclosed where exactly this data is stored, despite repeated inquiries. But even without confirmation from Google, it can be assumed that data such as mouse interaction, length of stay on a website or language settings are stored on the European or American Google servers. The IP address that your browser transmits to Google does generally not get merged with other Google data from the company\u2019s other services.<br>However, the data will be merged if you are logged in to your Google account while using the reCAPTCHA plug-in. Google\u2019s diverging privacy policy applies for this.</p><p><strong>How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?</strong></p><p>If you want to prevent any data about you and your behaviour to be transmitted to Google, you must fully log out of Google and delete all Google cookies before visiting our website or use the reCAPTCHA software.

API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a programming interface that connects software with hardware components.</p><p><strong>Why do we use cloud services?</strong></p><p>We use cloud services for several reasons. A cloud service offers us the opportunity to store our data securely. In addition, we can access the data from different locations and devices, giving us more flexibility and simplifying our work processes. Cloud storage also saves us costs because we don\u2019t have to set up and manage our own infrastructure for data storage and data security. By storing our data centrally in the cloud, we can also expand our application fields and manage our information much better.</p><p>As website operator or company, we use cloud services primarily for our own purposes. We e. g. manage our calendar and store documents or other important information in the cloud. However, your personal data may also be stored. This can take place if you provide us with your contact details (e.g. name and email address) while we store our customer data with a cloud provider. Consequently, any of your data we process may also be stored and processed on external servers. Provided we offer certain forms of content by cloud services on our website, cookies can also be set for web analysis and advertising purposes. Furthermore, such cookies retain your settings (e.g. the language used) so you will be provided with your usual web environment next time you visit our website.</p><p><strong>Which data is processed by cloud services?</strong></p><p>Much of the data we store in the cloud cannot be used to identify you as a person, but some data is personal data as defined by the GDPR. This is often customer data such as name, address, IP address or telephone number or technical device information. Videos, images and audio files may also be stored in the cloud. Exactly how the data is collected and stored depends on the respective service. We only try to use services that handle your data in a very reliable and professional manner. Generally, services such as Amazon Drive, have access to the stored files in order to be able to offer their own service accordingly. For this, however, the services require consent (such as for the right to copy files for security reasons). The data will be processed and handled as part of the provided services and in compliance with applicable laws. This also includes compliance with the GDPR for US providers (via the standard contractual clauses). In some cases, cloud services also cooperate with third parties who may process data under instructions and in accordance with privacy policies and other security measures. At this point we would like to emphasise again that all well-known cloud services (such as Amazon Drive, Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive) obtain the right to access stored content in order to be able to offer and optimise their own services accordingly.</p><p><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></p><p>We will inform you below about the duration of data processing, provided we have further information on this. In general, cloud services store data until you or we revoke the data storage or erase the retained data. In general, personal data is only stored for as long as it is necessary for the provision of the respective services. However, it may take up to several months to erase your data from the cloud. This may occur because data is usually not only stored on one server but divided between different servers.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You also have the right and the opportunity to revoke your consent to data storage in a cloud at any time. If cookies are used, you also have a right to withdraw your consent. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing the cookies in your browser. We also recommend you read our general privacy policy on cookies. To find out exactly which of your data is stored and processed, you should read the privacy policy of the respective cloud provider.</p><p><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p><p>We use cloud services mainly on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in good security and storage systems.</p><p>Certain types of processing, in particular the use of cookies and storage functions, require your consent. If you have consented to your data being processed and stored by cloud services, this consent is the legal basis for data processing (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Most of the services we use place cookies in your browser to store data. Thus, we recommend you read our privacy policy on cookies carefully and study the privacy policy or cookie policy of the relevant service provider.</p><p>Information on special tools \u2013 if available \u2013 can be found in the following sections.</p><p><strong>Microsoft Azure Cloud Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>We also use the cloud service Microsoft Azure Cloud for our website. The provider of this service is the American company Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.</p><p>Microsoft processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. Microsoft is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. More information can be found at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en\">https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en</a>.</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (Article 46(2) and (3) GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, Microsoft commits to maintaining the European data protection level when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission.

Therefore, you can watch videos or listen to music/podcasts directly via our website. This content is delivered by service providers and is obtained from the respective providers\u2019 servers.</p><p>Audio and video elements are integrated functional elements of platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo or Spotify. It is usually free of charge to use these portals, but they can also contain paid content. With the integrated elements, you can listen to or view any of their content on our website.</p><p>If you use audio or video elements on our website, your personal data may get transmitted to as well as processed and retained by service providers.</p><p><strong>Why do we use audio &amp; video elements on our website?</strong></p><p>We of course want to provide you with the best offer on our website. And we are aware that content is no longer just conveyed in text and static images. Instead of just giving you a link to a video, we offer you audio and video formats directly on our website. These are entertaining or informative, but ideally they are both. Our service therefore gets expanded and it gets easier for you to access interesting content. In addition to our texts and images, we thus also offer video and/or audio content.</p><p><strong>Which data are retained by audio &amp; video elements?</strong></p><p>When you visit a page on our website with e.g. an embedded video, your server connects to the service provider\u2019s server. Thus, your data will also be transferred to the third-party provider, where it will be stored. Certain data is collected and stored regardless of whether you have an account with the third party provider or not. This usually includes your IP address, browser type, operating system and other general information about your device. Most providers also collect information on your web activity. This e.g. includes the session duration, bounce rate, the buttons you clicked or information about the website you are using the service on. This data is mostly stored via cookies or pixel tags (also known as web beacons). Any data that is pseudonymised usually gets stored in your browser via cookies. In the respective provider\u2019s Privacy Policy, you can always find more information on the data that is stored and processed.</p><p><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></p><p>You can find out exactly how long the data is stored on the third-party provider\u2019s servers either in a lower point of the respective tool\u2019s Privacy Policy or in the provider\u2019s Privacy Policy. Generally, personal data is only processed for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services or products. This usually also applies to third-party providers. In most cases, you can assume that certain data will be stored on third-party providers\u2019 servers for several years. Data can be retained for different amounts of time, especially when stored in cookies. Some cookies are deleted after you leave a website, while others may be stored in your browser for a few years.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You also retain the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. You can e.g. also prevent data retention via cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing cookies in your browser. The legality of the processing up to the point of revocation remains unaffected.</p><p>Since the integrated audio and video functions on our site usually also use cookies, we recommend you to also read our general Privacy Policy on cookies. You can find out more about the handling and storage of your data in the Privacy Policies of the respective third party providers.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>If you have consented to the processing and storage of your data by integrated audio and video elements, your consent is considered the legal basis for data processing <strong>(Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR)</strong>. Generally, your data is also stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest <strong>(Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) </strong>in maintaining fast and good communication with you or other customers and business partners. We only use the integrated audio and video elements if you have consented to it.</p><p><strong>YouTube Privacy Policy</strong></p><figure><p><strong>YouTube Privacy Policy Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors<br>\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: optimising our service<br>\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: Data such as contact details, data on user behaviour, information about your device and IP address may be stored.<br>You can find more details on this in the privacy policy below.<br>\ud83d\udcc5 Storage period: data are generally stored for as long as is necessary for the purpose of the service<br>\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</p></figure><p><strong>What is YouTube?</strong></p><p>We have integrated YouTube videos to our website. Therefore, we can show you interesting videos directly on our site. YouTube is a video portal, which has been a subsidiary company of Google LLC since 2006. The video portal is operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. When you visit a page on our website that contains an embedded YouTube video, your browser automatically connects to the servers of YouTube or Google. Thereby, certain data are transferred (depending on the settings). Google is responsible for YouTube\u2019s data processing and therefore Google\u2019s data protection applies.</p><p>In the following we will explain in more detail which data is processed, why we have integrated YouTube videos and how you can manage or clear your data.</p><p>On YouTube, users can watch, rate, comment or upload videos for free. Over the past few years, YouTube has become one of the most important social media channels worldwide. For us to be able to display videos on our website, YouTube provides a code snippet that we have integrated to our website.</p><p><strong>Why do we use YouTube videos on our website?</strong></p><p>YouTube is the video platform with the most visitors and best content. We strive to offer you the best possible user experience on our website, which of course includes interesting videos. With the help of our embedded videos, we can provide you other helpful content in addition to our texts and images. Additionally, embedded videos make it easier for our website to be found on the Google search engine. Moreover, if we place ads via Google Ads, Google only shows these ads to people who are interested in our offers, thanks to the collected data.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by YouTube?</strong></p><p>As soon as you visit one of our pages with an integrated YouTube, YouTube places at least one cookie that stores your IP address and our URL. If you are logged into your YouTube account, by using cookies YouTube can usually associate your interactions on our website with your profile. This includes data such as session duration, bounce rate, approximate location, technical information such as browser type, screen resolution or your Internet provider. Additional data can include contact details, potential ratings, shared content via social media or YouTube videos you added to your favourites.</p><p>If you are not logged in to a Google or YouTube account, Google stores data with a unique identifier linked to your device, browser or app. Thereby, e.g. your preferred language setting is maintained. However, many interaction data cannot be saved since less cookies are set.</p><p>In the following list we show you cookies that were placed in the browser during a test.

GDPR (processing of special categories)</p></figure><p><strong>What are recruiting tools?</strong></p><p>Various companies offer software programs that can make application processes much easier. Most systems offer options to filter searches through databases of potential candidates. This enables us to quickly and efficiently find employees who are a great fit for our company. When using recruiting tools or online forms, applicants\u2019 personal data is transmitted, retained and managed. In this general Privacy Policy we also refer to the classic application process via email or online form in addition to recruiting tools. You can find more detailed information on recruiting tools in the Privacy Policies of the respective providers.</p><p><strong>Why do we use recruiting tools?</strong></p><p>To search for suitable applicants and to administer all application documents, we use software programs and platforms that specialize in application management, taking into account all legal guidelines. So-called recruiting tools usually make the application process easier because the software takes on many administrative tasks and optimizes processes in the application process. In some cases, this enables us to find suitable employees for our company more quickly.</p><p>For the conditions of the recruiting process, we refer in detail to the respective job advertisements.</p><p><strong>Which data are processed?</strong></p><p>If you apply with us, you of course also have to provide us with your data so we can assess your application accordingly. The exact details you provide us depends on the job posting or on the information required in the online form.</p><p>Generally, this involves data such as name, address, date of birth and proof of the qualifications required for the job. During the application process, however, not only basic personal data such as name or address may be transmitted, but information about applicants\u2019 health or ethnicity may also be requested so both parties can exercise the applicant\u2019s rights in relation to labor law, social security and social protection, while ensuring to meet the corresponding obligations. These data are called \u201cdata of special categories\u201d.</p><p>Your application\u2019s data are sent to us via the online form in encrypted nature. Alternatively, you can send your application to us by email. If you opt for the latter, your data will be transmitted in encrypted form, but will not be retained in encrypted form by the servers used to send and receive it.</p><p><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></p><p>If your application is successful, we can process the data you provide for the employment relationship. If the application does not meet the requirements, we will erase the data we received. The data will also be erased if you withdraw your application. If you agree to join our pool of applicants, we will store your data in this context until you leave the pool of applicants. The same rules apply to the withdrawal as well as to the revocation of your consent.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You always have the right and the option to withdraw your consent. The data will be deleted after 6 months at the latest, so we can answer any questions you may have about the application and meet our obligations to provide proof. We also archive invoices for possible reimbursement of travel expenses due to tax law requirements.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>If we include you in our application pool, this is done on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). We would like to note, that your consent to our application pool is voluntary and has no influence on the application process. Moreover, you can revoke your consent at any time.</p><p>In the event of the protection of vital interests, data processing takes place in accordance with Article 9 (2) c. GDPR. For the purposes of health care, occupational medicine, medical diagnostics, care or treatment in the health or social sector or for the administration of systems and services in the health or social sector, personal data is processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h. GDPR. If you voluntarily provide data of special categories, data processing takes place on the basis of Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a. GDPR.</p><p>Provided this information is available, you can find out more about the special recruiting tools in the following sections.</p><p><strong>LinkedIn Recruiter Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>On our website we use the LinkedIn Recruiter recruiting tool. The provider of this service is the American company LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p><p>LinkedIn also processes data in the USA, among other countries. We would like to note, that according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA.

Contrary to common belief, web design is not just about making our website look nice, but rather also about functionality and performance. But of course, a good-looking website is also a major goal of professional web design. Web design is a part of media design and deals with the visual as well as the structural and functional design of a website. Our aim with our web design is to improve your experience on our site. In web design jargon, this is called User Experience (UX) and usability. User Experience entails all impressions and experiences that website visitors come across on a website. What is more, usability is part of the User Experience, as it determines how user-friendly a website is. This includes the clear structuring of content, subpages or products, along with how quickly and easily the website enables you to find what you are looking for. In order to offer you the best possible experience on our website, we also use so-called third-party web design tools. Therefore, all tools and services that help improve our website\u2019s design are classified under the category \u201cweb design\u201d.&nbsp;This may, for example, include fonts, various plugins or other integrated web design functions.</p><p><strong>Why do we use web design tools?</strong></p><p>The way you absorb information on a website depends very much on its structure, functionality and visual perception. Therefore, good and professional web design has become increasingly important for us. We are constantly working on improving our site as a way of further extending our services for you as a website visitor. Furthermore, a beautiful and functioning website also has economic advantages for us. Needless to say, you will only visit it and take advantage of our offers if you feel completely at ease.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by web design tools?</strong></p><p>When you visit our website, any web design elements integrated into our pages may process your data. The exact data that is processed depends on the tools used. Below you can see exactly which tools we use for our website. For more information about data processing, we recommend you also read the respective privacy policy of the respective tools. There you can usually find out which data is processed, whether cookies are used and how long the data is stored. Moreover, fonts such as Google Fonts, for example, also automatically transmit information such as your language settings, IP address, browser version, browser screen resolution and browser name to Google\u2019s servers.</p><p><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></p><p>Data processing times are very individual and depend on the web design elements used. For example, when cookies are used, the retention period can be as little as a minute, but it may also be a few years. Please make yourself familiar with this topic. You may for example read our general section on cookies as well as the Privacy Policies of the tools used. There you can likely find out exactly which cookies are used and what information is stored there. For example, Google Font files are stored for one year, in order to improve the loading speed of a website. In principle, data is only kept for as long as is necessary to provide the service. But legal requirements may require data to be stored for longer.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You also retain the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. You can do this either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. You can also prevent cookies from collecting your data by managing, deactivating or deleting the cookies in your browser. However, among web design elements (typically fonts) there is also data that cannot be erased easily. This is the case whenever data is automatically collected as soon as a page is accessed and then directly transmitted to a third party (e.g. Google). In these cases, please contact the support of the respective provider. In the case of Google, you can reach support at <a href=\"https://support.google.com/?hl=en\">https://support.google.com/?hl=de</a>.</p><p><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p><p>If you have consented to the use of web design tools, this consent serves as the legal basis for the relevant data processing. According to Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR (consent), your consent represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as it may occur when it is collected by web design tools. We also have a legitimate interest in web design to improve on our website. After all, only then can we provide you with a beautiful and professional web offer. The corresponding legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we strongly want to emphasise once more that we only use web design tools if you have given your consent.</p><p>You can find information on different web design tools \u2013 if available \u2013 in the following sections.</p><p><strong>Google Fonts Privacy Policy</strong></p><figure><p><strong>Google Fonts Privacy Policy Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors<br>\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: service optimisation<br>\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: data such as IP address, CSS and font requests<br>You can find more details on this in the Privacy Policy below.<br>\ud83d\udcc5 Storage period: Google stores font files for one year<br>\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</p></figure><p><strong>What are Google Fonts?</strong></p><p>On our website we use Google Fonts, by the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).</p><p>To use Google Fonts, you must log in and set up a password. Furthermore, no cookies will be saved in your browser. The data (CSS, Fonts) will be requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, all requests for CSS and fonts are fully separated from any other Google services. If you have a Google account, you do not need to worry that your Google account details are transmitted to Google while you use Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as well as the utilised fonts and stores these data securely. We will have a detailed look at how exactly the data storage works.</p><p>Google Fonts (previously Google Web Fonts) is a directory with over 800 fonts that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google?tid=%5badsimpletextid\">Google</a> provides its users free of charge.</p><p>Many of these fonts have been published under the SIL Open Font License license, while others have been published under the Apache license. Both are free software licenses.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</strong></p><p>With Google Fonts we can use different fonts on our website and do not have to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is an important element which helps to keep the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are automatically optimised for the web, which saves data volume and is an advantage especially for the use of mobile terminal devices. When you use our website, the low data size provides fast loading times. Moreover, Google Fonts are secure Web Fonts. Various image synthesis systems (rendering) can lead to errors in different browsers, operating systems and mobile terminal devices. These errors could optically distort parts of texts or entire websites. Due to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) there are no cross-platform issues with Google Fonts. All common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) are supported by Google Fonts, and it reliably operates on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We also use Google Fonts for presenting our entire online service as pleasantly and as uniformly as possible.</p><p><strong>Which data is stored by Google?</strong></p><p>Whenever you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded by a Google server. Through this external cue, data gets transferred to Google\u2019s servers. Therefore, this makes Google recognise that you (or your IP-address) is visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was developed to reduce the usage, storage and gathering of end user data to the minimum needed for the proper depiction of fonts. What is more, API stands for \u201eApplication Programming Interface\u201c and works as a software data intermediary.</p><p>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests safely with Google, and therefore it is protected. Using its collected usage figures, Google can determine how popular the individual fonts are. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Moreover, Google also utilises data of ist own web crawler, in order to determine which websites are using Google fonts. This data is published in Google Fonts\u2019 BigQuery database. Enterpreneurs and developers use Google\u2019s webservice BigQuery to be able to inspect and move big volumes of data.</p><p>One more thing that should be considered, is that every request for Google Fonts automatically transmits information such as language preferences, IP address, browser version, as well as the browser\u2019s screen resolution and name to Google\u2019s servers. It cannot be clearly identified if this data is saved, as Google has not directly declared it.</p><p><strong>How long and where is the data stored?</strong></p><p>Google saves requests for CSS assets for one day in a tag on their servers, which are primarily located outside of the EU. This makes it possible for us to use the fonts by means of a Google stylesheet. With the help of a stylesheet, e.g. designs or fonts of a website can get changed swiftly and easily.</p><p>Any font related data is stored with Google for one year. This is because Google\u2019s aim is to fundamentally boost websites\u2019 loading times. With millions of websites referring to the same fonts, they are buffered after the first visit and instantly reappear on any other websites that are visited thereafter. Sometimes Google updates font files to either reduce the data sizes, increase the language coverage or to improve the design.</p><p><strong>How can I erase my data or prevent it being stored?</strong></p><p>The data Google stores for either a day or a year cannot be deleted easily. Upon opening the page this data is automatically transmitted to Google. In order to clear the data ahead of time, you have to contact Google\u2019s support at <a href=\"https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&amp;tid=122472826\">https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&amp;tid=122472826</a>. The only way for you to prevent the retention of your data is by not visiting our website.</p><p>Unlike other web fonts, Google offers us unrestricted access to all its fonts. Thus, we have a vast sea of font types at our disposal, which helps us to get the most out of our website. You can find out more answers and information on Google Fonts at <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=122472826\">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=122472826</a>. While Google does address relevant elements on data protection at this link, it does not contain any detailed information on data retention.<br>It proofs rather difficult to receive any precise information on stored data by Google.</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>If you have consented to the use of Google Fonts, your consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to <strong>Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (Consent) </strong>your consent is the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as can occur when it is processed by Google Fonts.</p><p>We also have a legitimate interest in using Google Font to optimise our online service. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. Nevertheless, we only use Google Font if you have given your consent to it.</p><p>Google processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. Google is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. More information can be found at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en\">https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en</a>.</p><p>Additionally, Google uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (Article 46(2) and (3) GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, Google commits to maintaining the European data protection level when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding Standard Contractual Clauses here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847</a>.</p><p>You can find the Google Ads Data Processing Terms, which refer to the Standard Contractual Clauses, at: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://business.safety.google/intl/en/adsprocessorterms/\">https://business.safety.google/intl/en/adsprocessorterms/</a></p><p>You can find more information on which data is generally retained by Google and what this data is used at <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de&amp;tid=122472826\">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB</a>.</p><p><strong>Google Fonts Local Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>On our website we use Google Fonts, by the company Google Inc. The responsible entity for the European area is Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland). We have integrated Google fonts locally, i.e. on our web server and not on Google\u2019s servers. This means that no connection to Google\u2019s servers and therefore no data transfer or retention take place.</p><p><strong>What are Google Fonts?</strong></p><p>Google Fonts was previously called Google Web Fonts. It is an interactive list with over 800 fonts which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google?tid=122472826\">Google</a> offer for free use. With the use of Google Fonts, it is possible to utilise fonts without uploading them to your own server. In order to prevent any transfer of information to Google\u2019s servers, we downloaded the fonts to our own server. This way we can comply with data privacy and do not transmit any data to Google Fonts.</p><p><strong>Online Map Services Introduction</strong></p><figure><p><strong>Online Map Services Privacy Policy Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors<br>\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: Improvement of user experience<br>\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: the data that is processed depends heavily on the services used.

Google Maps is probably the service you are most familiar with. But there are also other providers out there that specialise in creating digital maps. These services allow the display of locations, route maps or other geographical information directly via our website. Thanks to an integrated map service, you no longer have to leave our website to e. g. view the route to a location. In order to ensure that the online map can run on our website, we have integrated map sections within our HTML code. This way the services can display street maps, the earth\u2019s surface, or aerial or satellite imagery. If you use the built-in map service, your data will be transferred to the tool used, where it will be retained. This may also include your personal data.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Online Map Services on our website?</strong></p><p>Generally speaking, it is imperative for us to offer you a pleasant time on our website. Of course, we know that you will most likely only enjoy your time here if you can easily find your way around and find all the information you need quickly and easily. Therefore, we decided that an online map system may be a significant optimisation of our website\u2019s service. After all, you can use the map system to easily view route descriptions, locations or any other points of interest \u2013 without leaving our site. Needless to say, it is certainly also very practical that you can easily see where our company headquarters are so that you can find us quickly and safely. As you can see, there are just a lot of advantages \u2013 and we clearly consider online map services on our website to be part of our customer service.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by Online Map Services?</strong></p><p>If you open a page on our website with an online map function installed, your personal data may be transmitted to the relevant service, where it may be stored. This usually includes your IP address, which may also be used to determine your approximate location. In addition to your IP address, data such as the search terms you entered, as well as your longitude and latitude coordinates will be stored. If you e. g. enter an address for route planning, this data will also be stored. This data is not stored by us but instead on the servers of the integrated tools. You can think of it like this: You may be on our website, but when you interact with a mapping service, that interaction is actually happening on their website. Moreover, in order for the service to function properly, at least one cookie is usually set in your browser. As an example, Google Maps also uses cookies to record user behaviour, with which it can optimise its own service and offer personalised advertising. You can find out more about cookies in our \u201cCookies\u201d section.</p><p><strong>How long and where is the data stored?</strong></p><p>Every online map service processes different user data. Provided we have further information, we will inform you about the duration of data processing in the corresponding sections on the individual tools below. Generally, personal data is only retained for as long as is necessary to provide the service. Google Maps e. g. stores certain data for a specified period of time, but you must erase other data yourself. At Mapbox, for example, your IP address is stored for 30 days after which it is deleted. As you can see, each tool stores data for different lengths of time. We thus recommend you take a closer look at the privacy policies of the tools used.</p><p>The providers may use cookies to store data on your user behaviour in relation to their map services. You can find more information about cookies in our \u201cCookies\u201d section, but in the individual providers\u2019 privacy policies you can most probably also find out which cookies may be used. In most cases, however, this is only an indicative list and is not exhaustive.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>You always have the possibility and the right to access your personal data and to object to its use and processing. You can also revoke the consent you gave to us at any time. This is usually easiest through the cookie consent tool. However, there are other opt-out tools that you can use. You can also manage, erase or deactivate any cookies set by the used providers yourself with just a few mouse clicks. However, this may lead to some service functions stopping to work as usual. It also depends on your browser how you can manage cookies there. In our \u201cCookies\u201d section you will find links to instructions of the most popular browsers.</p><p><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p><p>If you have agreed to the use of an online map service, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing is this consent. According to Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. (consent) this consent is the legal basis for the processing of personal data as may occur when collected by an online map service.</p><p>We also have a legitimate interest in using an online map service to optimise our service on our website. The corresponding legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use an online map service if you have given your consent. We definitely wanted to stress this point once again.</p><p>You can find information on specific online map services \u2013 if available \u2013 in the following sections.</p><p><strong>Google Maps Privacy Policy</strong></p><figure><p><strong>Google Maps Privacy Policy Overview</strong>&nbsp;<br>\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors<br>\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: service optimisation<br>\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: data such as entered search terms, IP address as well as latitude and longitude coordinates.<br>You can find more details on this in the Privacy Policy below.<br>\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: depending on the retained data<br>\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</p></figure><p><strong>What is Google Maps?</strong></p><p>On our website we use Google Maps of the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With the use of Google Maps, we can show you locations in a better way and can therefore adjust our service to your needs. Due to the utilisation of Google Maps, data gets transferred to Google and is saved on Google\u2019s servers. In the following, we want to explain in detail what Google Maps is, why we use this Google service, what data is stored and how you can prevent this.</p><p>Google Maps is an internet maps service of the company Google Inc. With Google Maps you can search for exact locations of cities, sights, accommodations or businesses online via a PC, a tablet or an app. If businesses are represented on Google My Business, the respective location as well as other information about the company are shown there. In order to show route directions, a location\u2019s map sections can be integrated in a website through a HTML-code. Google Maps depicts the earth\u2019s surface as either a road map or as air and satellite images. Due to the street view and high-quality satellite images, it is possible for exact representations to be made.</p><p><strong>Why do we use Google Maps on our website?</strong></p><p>The efforts we make on this page have the goal of giving you a useful and meaningful experience on our website. Through the integration of Google Maps, we can offer you essential information on various locations. Therefore, you can spot our office address with one glance. Furthermore, the route directions always show you the best and fastest way to us. You can retrieve the route directions for traveling either by car, by public transport, on foot or by bike. The integration of Google Maps is a part of our customer service.</p><p><strong>What data is stored by Google Maps?</strong></p><p>For Google Maps to offer its full services, the company must collect and store your data. This includes your entered search terms, your IP-address as well as your longitude and latitude coordinates. When you use the route-planner function, the entered start address is stored also. However, this data retention happens on Google Maps\u2018 websites. We can only inform you about it but cannot influence it in any way. Since we have included Google Maps on our website, Google will set at least one cookie (Name: NID) into your browser. This cookie saves data on your user behaviour. Google primarily uses this data to optimise ist own services and to provide you with individual, personalised advertisements.</p><p>The following cookies are set in your browser due to the integration of Google Maps:</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> NID<br><strong>Value:</strong> 188=h26c1Ktha7fCQTx8rXgLyATyITJ122472826-5<br><strong>Purpose:</strong> Google uses NID in order to adjust advertisments to your Google searches. With the cookie\u2019s help Google \u201cremembers\u201c your most frequently entered search queries or your previous interaction with ads. That way you always receive customised adertisments. The cookie contains a unique ID, wich Google uses to collect your personal settings for advertising porposes.<br><strong>Expiration date:</strong> after 6 months</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We cannot guarantee completeness of the information on saved data. This is, because especially concerning the use of cookies, changes can happen anytime. To identify the cookie NID, a test page was created, to which Google Maps was included.</p><p><strong>How long and where is the data stored?</strong></p><p>There are Google servers in data centres across the entire planet. However, most servers are in America. For this reason, your data is widely stored in the USA. Here you can read in detail about where the Google servers are located: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=en\">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=en</a></p><p>Google distributes data to various data carriers. This makes it possible to retrieve the data faster and to better protect it from possible attempted manipulations. Every server has emergency programs. Thus, should for example a problem with Google\u2019s hardware occur or should a natural disaster impact the servers, any data will quite certainly stay protected.</p><p>Moreover, Google saves some data for a specified period. With some other data on the other hand, Google only offers the opportunity for deleting it manually. Furthermore, the company anonymises information (e.g. advertising data) in server logs, by deleting a part of the IP-address and cookie information after 9 to 18 months.</p><p><strong>How can I erase my data, or prevent data retention?</strong></p><p>Due to the automatic delete function for location and activity data, which was introduced in 2019, information that is used for determining your location and web or app activity is saved for either 3 or 18 months, depending on your preferred decision, and is deleted thereafter. Furthermore, it is possible to delete this data manually from your browser history via your Google account anytime. If you want to prevent the determination of your location altogether, you must pause the category \u201cWeb and app activity\u201d in your Google account. Click on \u201cData and personalisation\u201d and then choose the option \u201cActivity controls\u201d. Here you can switch the activities on or off.</p><p>Moreover, in your browser you can deactivate, delete or manage individual cookies.

Usually, they are various plugins and integrated elements that are meant to improve our website. Generally, these functions are obtained from third parties and integrated into our website. They may e.g. be web search services such as Algolia Place, Giphy, Programmable Search Engine or online services for weather data such as OpenWeather.</p><p><strong>Why do we use these third parties?</strong></p><p>With our website, we want to provide you with the best web offer in our industry. Websites have long been so much more than just a business card for companies. Instead, they are a place designed to help you find what you\u2019re looking for. And in order to make our website even more interesting and helpful for you, we use various third-party services.</p><p><strong>Which data is processed?</strong></p><p>Whenever elements are integrated into our website, your IP address will be transmitted to the respective provider, where it will be stored and processed. This is necessary to send the content to your browser which will then display it for you. Moreover, service providers may also use pixel tags or web beacons. These are small graphics on websites that can record a log file and create analyses of it. Providers can improve their own marketing measures with the information they receive this way. In addition to pixel tags, this information (e.g. which button you click or when you access which page) can also be stored in cookies. In addition to data analyses on your web behaviour, technical information such as your browser type or operating system may also be stored there. Some providers can also link the data they obtain to other internal services or to third-party providers. Each provider handles your data differently. Therefore, we recommend you carefully read the privacy policies of the respective services. We make every effort to only use services that operate very carefully in regards to data protection and privacy.</p><p><strong>Duration of data processing</strong></p><p>Below we will inform you about the duration of data processing, provided we have further information on this. In general, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products.</p><p><strong>Legal Basis</strong></p><p>If we ask for your consent and you agree to us using a service, this consent serves as the legal basis for the processing of your data (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). In addition to your consent, we have a legitimate interest in analysing the behaviour of our website visitors and thus technically and economically improving our offer. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use any tools if you have given your consent.</p><p>Information on the special tools \u2013 if available \u2013 can be found in the following sections.</p><p><strong>Clarity Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>On our website we use Clarity, which is a project and portfolio tool.

We would like to note, that according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA. This can be associated with various risks to the legality and security of data processing.</p><p>Broadcom uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission as the basis for data processing by recipients based in third countries (i. e. outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and thus especially in the USA) or data transfer there (= Art. 46, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are legal templates provided by the EU Commission. Their purpose is to ensure that your data complies with European data privacy standards, even if your data is transferred to and stored in third countries (such as the USA). With these clauses, Broadcom commits to comply with the EU\u2018s level of data protection when processing relevant data, even if it is stored, processed and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing order by the EU Commission.

However, this is not always easy, especially when it comes to technical and legal matters. It is often sensible to use legal terms (such as \u2018personal data)\u2019 or certain technical terms (such as \u2018cookies\u2019 or \u2018IP address\u2019). But we don\u2019t want to use such terms without any explanation. This is why you will find an alphabetical list of important terms used below. These are terms we may not yet have sufficiently explained in the privacy policy. In case we have adopted any of these terms from the GDPR which are definitions, we will also list the GDPR texts here and add our own further explanations if necessary.</p><p><strong>Processor</strong></p><p><strong>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:</p><p><i><strong>\u201cprocessor\u201d</strong> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;</i></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> As a company and a website owner, we are responsible for all your data we process (i. e. the \u2018controller\u2019). In addition to the controller, there may also be so-called processors. This includes any company or person who processes personal data on our behalf. In addition to service providers such as tax consultants, processors can also be hosting or cloud providers, payment or newsletter providers or large companies such as Google or Microsoft.</p><p><strong>Consent</strong></p><p><strong>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:</p><p><i><strong>\u201cconsent\u201d</strong>&nbsp;of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her;</i></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>With websites, such consent is usually given via a cookie consent tool. You\u2019ve most certainly come across these. Whenever you visit a website for the first time, you will usually be asked via a banner whether you agree or consent to the data processing. You can usually also make individual settings and thus decide for yourself which level of data processing you want to allow. If you do not give your consent, no personal data may be processed. Consent can of course also be given in writing, i.e. not via a tool.</p><p><strong>Personal Data</strong></p><p><strong>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:</p><p><i><strong>\u201cpersonenal data\u201d</strong></i><strong> </strong><i>means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data subject\u2019); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;</i></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Personal data is all data that can identify you as a person. This is usually data such as:</p><ul><li>name</li><li>address</li><li>email address</li><li>postal address</li><li>phone number</li><li>birthday</li><li>identification numbers such as social security number, tax identification number, ID card number or matriculation number</li><li>banking data such as account number, credit information, account balances and more.</li></ul><p>According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), your <strong>IP address is also personal data</strong>. IT experts can use your IP address to determine at least the approximate location of your device and subsequently your location as the connection owner. Therefore, storing an IP address also requires a legal basis within the scope of the GDPR. There are also so-called <strong>\u201cspecial categories\u201d</strong> of personal data, which are particularly worthy of protection. These include:</p><ul><li>racial and ethnic origin</li><li>political opinions</li><li>religious or ideological beliefs</li><li>Union membership</li><li>genetic data such as data obtained from blood or saliva samples</li><li>biometric data (this is information about psychological, physical or behavioural characteristics that can identify an individual).<br>health Data</li><li>Data relating to sexual orientation or sex life</li></ul><p><strong>Profiling</strong></p><p><strong>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:</p><p><i><strong>\u201cProfiling\u201d</strong> means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;</i></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Profiling collects various personal data about an individual in order to learn more about that individual. On the internet, profiling is often used for advertising purposes or for credit checks. Web and advertising analysis programs e. g. collect data about your behaviour and interests on a website. This results in a special user profile that can be used to target advertising to specific target groups.</p><p><strong>Controller</strong></p><p><strong>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:</p><p><i><strong>\u201ccontroller\u201d</strong> means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;</i></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In our example, we are responsible for the processing of your personal data and are therefore the \u201ccontroller\u201d. If we pass on collected data to other service providers for processing, they are considered \u201ccontract processors\u201d. For this, a \u201cData Processing Agreement (DPA)\u201d must be concluded.</p><p><strong>Processing</strong></p><p><strong>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:</p><p><i><strong>\u201cprocessing\u201d</strong></i><strong> </strong><i>means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;</i></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>When we talk about processing in our Privacy Policy, we talk about any type of data processing. As mentioned above in the original GDPR declaration, this includes not only the collection but also the storage and processing of data.</p><p><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></p><p>Congratulations! If you are reading these lines, you have most likely familiarised yourself with our entire Privacy Policy \u2013 or at least scrolled down here. As you can see from the scope of our Privacy Policy, we do not take the protection of your personal data lightly.<br>We find it important to inform you about the processing of your personal data to the best of our abilities. In doing so, we not only want to tell you which data is processed but also explain to you why we use various software programs. In general, Privacy Policies have very technical and legal jargon. However, since most of you are not web developers or solicitors, we wanted to take a different approach and explain the facts in simple and clear language. Of course, this is not always possible due to the subject matter. Therefore, you can also find a more detailed explanation of the most important terms at the end of the Privacy Policy.<br>If you have any questions about data protection on our website, please do not hesitate to contact us or the responsible body.

The terms used are to be considered gender-neutral.In short: We provide you with comprehensive information about any of your personal data we process.Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. However, this privacy policy is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. So long as it aids transparency, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner, links to further information are provided and graphics are used. We are thus informing in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the context of our business activities if there is a legal basis for it. This is certainly not possible with brief, unclear and legal-technical statements, as is often standard on the internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative. Maybe you will also find some information that you have not been familiar with.If you still have questions, we kindly ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the imprint, follow the existing links and look at further information on third-party sites. You can of course also find our contact details in the imprint.ScopeThis privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by our company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). With the term personal data, we refer to information within the meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address and postal address of a person. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, be it online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operateSocial media presences and email communicationmobile apps for smartphones and other devicesIn short: This privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner by the company via the channels mentioned. Should we enter into legal relations with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.Legal basesIn the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.Whenever EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course access the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU online at EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679.We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:Consent (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of data you entered into a contact form.Contract (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR): We process your data in order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you. For example, if we conclude a sales contract with you, we need personal information in advance.Legal obligation (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we will process your data. For example, we are legally required to keep invoices for our bookkeeping. These usually contain personal data.Legitimate interests (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your basic rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we have to process certain data in order to be able to operate our website securely and economically. Therefore, the processing is a legitimate interest.Other conditions such as making recordings in the interest of the public, the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not usually occur with us. Should such a legal basis be relevant, it will be disclosed in the appropriate place.In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:In Austria this is the Austrian Data Protection Act (Datenschutzgesetz), in short DSG.In Germany this is the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz), in short BDSG.Should other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.Contact details of the data protection controllerIf you have any questions about data protection, you will find the contact details of the responsible person or controller below:Michael Lisch \u2013 Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrerWolfVision GmbHOberes Ried 146833 Klaus\u00d6sterreich, VorarlbergE-Mail: wolfvision@wolfvision.com\u00a0Phone: +43-(0)5523-52250\u00a0Company details: https://wolfvision.com/de/impressumStorage PeriodIt is a general criterion for us to store personal data only for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as any reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to keep certain data stored even after the original purpose no longer exists, such as for accounting purposes.If you want your data to be deleted or if you want to revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible, provided there is no obligation to continue its storage.We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided we have further information.Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection RegulationIn accordance with Articles 13, 14 of the GDPR, we inform you about the following rights you have to ensure fair and transparent processing of data:According to Article 15 DSGVO, you have the right to information about whether we are processing data about you. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and to know the following information:for what purpose we are processing;the categories, i.e. the types of data that are processed;who receives this data and if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed;how long the data will be stored;the existence of the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing and the right to object to processing;that you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below);the origin of the data if we have not collected it from you;Whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated to arrive at a personal profile of you.You have a right to rectification of data according to Article 16 GDPR, which means that we must correct data if you find errors.You have the right to erasure (\u201cright to be forgotten\u201d) according to Article 17 GDPR, which specifically means that you may request the deletion of your data.According to Article 18 of the GDPR, you have the right to restriction of processing, which means that we may only store the data but not use it further.According to Article 20 of the GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that we will provide you with your data in a standard format upon request.According to Article 21 DSGVO, you have the right to object, which entails a change in processing after enforcement.If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you may object to the processing. We will then check as soon as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection.If data is used to conduct direct advertising, you may object to this type of data processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for direct marketing.If data is used to conduct profiling, you may object to this type of data processing at any time. We may no longer use your data for profiling thereafter.According to Article 22 of the GDPR, you may have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (for example, profiling).You have the right to lodge a complaint under Article 77 of the GDPR. This means that you can complain to the data protection authority at any time if you believe that the data processing of personal data violates the GDPR.In short: you have rights \u2013 do not hesitate to contact the responsible party listed above with us!If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. For Austria, this is the data protection authority, whose website can be found at https://www.dsb.gv.at/. In Germany, there is a data protection officer for each federal state. For more information, you can contact the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI). The following local data protection authority is responsible for our company:Austria Data protection authorityManager: Mag. Dr. Andrea Jelinek\u00a0Address: Barichgasse 40-42, 1030 Wien\u00a0Phone number.: +43 1 52\u00a0152-0\u00a0E-mail address: dsb@dsb.gv.at\u00a0Website: https://www.dsb.gv.at/Security of data processing operationsIn order to protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organisational measures. We encrypt or pseudonymise personal data wherever this is possible. Thus, we make it as difficult as we can for third parties to extract personal information from our data.Article 25 of the GDPR refers to \u201cdata protection by technical design and by data protection-friendly default\u201d which means that both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to server rooms) appropriate safeguards and security measures shall always be placed. If applicable, we will outline the specific measures below.TLS encryption with httpsThe terms TLS, encryption and https sound very technical, which they are indeed. We use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to securely transfer data on the Internet.This means that the entire transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured \u2013 nobody can \u201clisten in\u201d.We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and meet privacy requirements through technology design Article 25 Section 1 GDPR). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information.You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol , which is situated in your browser\u2019s top left corner in the left of the internet address (e.g. examplepage.uk), as well as by the display of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.If you want to know more about encryption, we recommend you to do a Google search for \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki\u201d to find good links to further information.CommunicationsCommunications Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: Anyone who communicates with us via phone, email or online form\ud83e\udd1d Processed data: e. g. telephone number, name, email address or data entered in forms. You can find more details on this under the respective form of contact\ud83d\udcd3 Purpose: handling communication with customers, business partners, etc.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: for the duration of the business case and the legal requirements\u2696\ufe0f Legal basis: Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR (consent), Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR (contract), Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests)If you contact us and communicate with us via phone, email or online form, your personal data may be processed.The data will be processed for handling and processing your request and for the related business transaction. The data is stored for this period of time or for as long as is legally required.Affected personsThe above-mentioned processes affect all those who seek contact with us via the communication channels we provide.TelephoneWhen you call us, the call data is stored in a pseudonymised form on the respective terminal device, as well as by the telecommunications provider that is being used. In addition, data such as your name and telephone number may be sent via email and stored for answering your inquiries. The data will be erased as soon as the business case has ended and the legal requirements allow for its erasure.EmailIf you communicate with us via email, your data is stored on the respective terminal device (computer, laptop, smartphone, \u2026) as well as on the email server. The data will be deleted as soon as the business case has ended and the legal requirements allow for its erasure.Online formsIf you communicate with us using an online form, your data is stored on our web server and, if necessary, forwarded to our email address. The data will be erased as soon as the business case has ended and the legal requirements allow for its erasure.Legal basesData processing is based on the following legal bases:Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent): You give us your consent to store your data and to continue to use it for the purposes of the business case;Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (contract): For the performance of a contract with you or a processor such as a telephone provider, or if we have to process the data for pre-contractual activities, such as preparing an offer;Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests): We want to conduct our customer inquiries and business communication in a professional manner. Thus, certain technical facilities such email programs, Exchange servers and mobile network operators are necessary to efficiently operate our communications.Data Processing Agreement (DPA)In this section, we would like to explain what a Data Processing Agreement is and why it is needed. As the term \u201cData Processing Agreement\u201d is quite lengthy, we will often only use the acronym DPA here in this text. Like most companies, we do not work alone, but also use the services of other companies or individuals. By involving different companies or service providers, we may pass on personal data for processing. These partners then act as processors with whom we conclude a contract, the so-called Data Processing Agreement (DPA). Most importantly for you to know is that any processing of your personal data takes place exclusively according to our instructions and must be regulated by the DPA.Who are the processors?As a company and website owner, we are responsible for any of your data that is processed by us. In addition to the controller, there may also be so-called processors involved. This includes any company or person who processes your personal data. More precisely and according to the GDPR\u2019s definition, this means: Any natural or legal person, authority, institution or other entity that processes your personal data is considered a processor. Processors can therefore be service providers such as hosting or cloud providers, payment or newsletter providers or large companies such as Google or Microsoft.To make the terminology easier to comprehend, here is an overview of the GDPR\u2019s three roles:Data subject (you as a customer or interested party) \u2192 Controller\u00a0(we as a company and contracting entity) \u2192 Processors (service providers such as web hosts or cloud providers)Contents of a Data Processing AgreementAs mentioned above, we have concluded a\u00a0DPA with our partners who act as processors. First and foremost, it states that the processor processes the data exclusively in accordance with the GDPR. The contract must be concluded in writing, although an electronic contract completion is also considered a \u201cwritten contract\u201d. Any processing of personal data only takes place after this contract is concluded. The contract must contain the following:indication to us as the controllerobligations and rights of the controllercategories of data subjectstype of personal datatype and purpose of data processingsubject and duration of data processinglocation of data processingFurthermore, the contract contains all obligations of the processor. The most important obligations are:ensuring data security measurestaking possible technical and organisational measures to protect the rights of the data subjectmaintaining a data processing recordcooperation with the data protection authority upon requestperforming a risk analysis for any received personal datasubprocessors may only be appointed with the written consent of the controllerYou can see an example of what a\u00a0DPA looks like at https://gdpr.eu/data-processing-agreement/. This link shows a sample contract.CookiesCookies Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: visitors to the website\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: depending on the respective cookie. You can find out more details below or from the software manufacturer that sets the cookie.\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: depends on the cookie used. More details can be found below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: can vary from hours to years, depending on the respective cookie\u2696\ufe0f Legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What are cookies?Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.In the following we explain what cookies are and why they are used, so that you can better understand the following privacy policy.Whenever you surf the Internet, you are using a browser. Common browsers are for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.It is important to note that cookies are very useful little helpers. Almost every website uses cookies. More precisely, these are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other uses. HTTP cookies are small files that our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically placed into the cookie-folder, which is the \u201cbrain\u201d of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website to visit again, your browser submits these \u201cuser-related\u201d information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file, while in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser such as Chrome and the web server. The web browser requests a website and receives a cookie back from the server. The browser then uses this again as soon as another page is requested.There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, as each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, trojans or other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC\u2019s information.This is an example of how cookie-files can look:Name: _gaValue: GA1.2.1326744211.152122472826-9Purpose: Differentiation between website visitorsExpiry date: after 2 yearsA browser should support these minimum sizes:At least 4096 bytes per cookieAt least 50 cookies per domainAt least 3000 cookies in totalWhich types of cookies are there?The exact cookies that we use, depend on the used services, which will be outlined in the following sections of this privacy policy. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.There are 4 different types of cookies:Essential cookiesThese cookies are necessary to ensure the basic functions of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. These cookies ensure the shopping cart does not get deleted, even if the user closes their browser window.Purposive cookiesThese cookies collect information about user behaviour and whether the user receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website\u2019s loading time as well as its behaviour in different browsers.Target-orientated cookiesThese cookies ensure better user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts sizes or data in forms stay stored.Advertising cookiesThese cookies are also known as targeting cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering customised advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be stored in a cookie.If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called \u201cHTTP State Management Mechanism\u201d.Purpose of processing via cookiesThe purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. You can find out more details below or from the software manufacturer that sets the cookie.Which data are processed?Cookies are little helpers for a wide variety of tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell which data is generally stored in cookies, but in the privacy policy below we will inform you on what data is processed or stored.Storage period of cookiesThe storage period depends on the respective cookie and is further specified below. Some cookies are erased after less than an hour, while others can remain on a computer for several years.You can also influence the storage duration yourself. You can manually erase all cookies at any time in your browser (also see \u201cRight of objection\u201d below). Furthermore, the latest instance cookies based on consent will be erased is after you withdraw your consent. The legality of storage will remain unaffected until then.Right of objection \u2013 how can I erase cookies?You can decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies originate from, you always have the option of erasing, deactivating or only partially accepting cookies. You can for example block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.If you want to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, or if you want to change or erase cookie settings, you can find this option in your browser settings:Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in ChromeSafari: Manage cookies and website data in SafariFirefox: Clear cookies and site data in FirefoxInternet Explorer: Delete and manage cookiesMicrosoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft EdgeIf you generally do not want cookies, you can set up your browser in a way to notify you whenever a cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. This procedure varies depending on the browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search term \u201cdelete cookies Chrome\u201d or \u201cdeactivate cookies Chrome\u201d into Google.Legal basisThe so-called \u201ccookie directive\u201d has existed since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires your consent (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR). Within countries of the EU, however, the reactions to these guidelines still vary greatly. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG). In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this guideline was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG).For absolutely necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given, there are legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to offer our visitors a pleasant user experience on our website. For this, certain cookies often are absolutely necessary.This is exclusively done with your consent, unless absolutely necessary cookies are used. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR.In the following sections you will find more detail on the use of cookies, provided the used software does use cookies.Customer DataCustomer Data Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65Affected parties: Customers or business and contractual partners\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: Performance of a contract for the provision of agreed services or prior to entering into such a contract, including associated communications.\ud83d\udcd3 Data processed: name, address, contact details, email address, telephone number, payment information (such as invoices and bank details), contract data (such as duration and subject matter of the contract), IP address, order data\ud83d\udcc5 Storage period: the data will be erased as soon as they are no longer required for our business purposes and there is no legal obligation to process them.\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR), Contract (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR)What is customer data?In order to be able to offer our services and contractual services, we also process data from our customers and business partners. This data always includes personal data. Customer data is all information that is processed on the basis of contractual or pre-contractual agreements so that the offered services can be provided. Customer data is therefore all the information we collect and process about our customers.Why do we process customer data?There are many reasons why we collect and process customer data. The main reason is that we simply need specific data to provide our services. Sometimes for example your email address may be enough. But if you purchase a product or service, we may e. g. also need data such as your name, address, bank details or other contract data. This data will subsequently be used for marketing and sales optimisation so that we can improve our overall service for our customers and clients. Another important reason for data processing is our customer service, which is very important to us. We want you to have the opportunity to contact us at any time with questions about our offers. Thus, we may need certain data such as your email address at the very least.What data is processed?Exactly which data is stored can only be shown by putting them in categories. All in all, it always depends on which of our services you receive. In some cases, you may only give us your email address so that we can e. g. contact you or answer your questions. In other instances, you may purchase one of our products or services. Then we may need significantly more information, such as your contact details, payment details and contract details.Here is a list of potential data we may receive and process:NameContact addressEmail addressPhone numberYour birthdayPayment data (invoices, bank details, payment history, etc.)Contract data (duration, contents)Usage data (websites visited, access data, etc.)Metadata (IP address, device information)How long is the data stored?We erase corresponding customer data as soon as we no longer need it to fulfill our contractual obligations and purposes, and as soon as the data is also no longer necessary for possible warranty and liability obligations. This can for example be the case when a business contract ends. Thereafter, the limitation period is usually 3 years, although longer periods may be possible in individual cases. Of course, we also comply with the statutory retention requirements. Your customer data will certainly not be passed on to third parties unless you have given your explicit consent.Legal BasisThe legal basis for the processing of your data is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a GDPR (consent), Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter b GDPR (contract or pre-contractual measures), Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f GDPR (legitimate interests) and in special cases (e. g. medical services) Art. 9 (2) lit. GDPR (processing of special categories).In the case of protecting vital interests, data processing is carried out in accordance with Article 9 Paragraph 2 Letter c. GDPR. For the purposes of health care, occupational medicine, medical diagnostics, care or treatment in the health or social sectors or for the administration of systems and services in health or social sectors, the processing of personal data takes place in accordance with Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. h. GDPR. If you voluntarily provide data of these special categories, the processing takes place on the basis of Article 9 Paragraph 2 lit. a GDPR.RegistrationRegistration Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: Anyone who registers to create an account with us, and logs in to use the account.\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: Personal data such as email address, name, password and other data that is collected during registration, login and account use.\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: For the provision of our services, as well as to communicate with clients or customers in the scope of our services.\u00a0\ud83d\udcc5Storage period: As long as the company account associated with the texts exists, plus a period of usually 3 years.\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Article 6 paragraph 1 letter b GDPR (contract), Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a GDPR (consent), Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f GDPR (legitimate interests)If you register with us and provide any personal data, this data may be processed, possibly along with your IP address. Below you can explore what we mean by the rather broad term \u201cpersonal data\u201d.Please only enter the data we need for the registration. In case you are registering on behalf of a third party, please only enter data for which you have the approval of the party you are registering for. If possible, use a secure password that you don\u2019t use anywhere else and an email address that you check regularly.In the following, we will inform you about the exact type of data processing we do. After all, we want you to feel at ease with the services we provide!What is a registration?When you register, we retain certain of your data in order to make it easy for you to log in with us online and use your account. An account with us has the advantage that you don\u2019t have to re-enter everything every time. It saves time and effort and ultimately prevents any issues with the provision of our services.Why do we process personal data?In short, we process personal data to make account registration and usage possible for you. If we didn\u2019t do this, you would have to enter all your data each time, wait for our approval and then enter everything again. This strenuous process would probably not only irritate us a little, but also many of our dear clients and customers.Which data is processed?Any data that you provided during registration or login and any data that you may enter as part of managing your account data.During registration, we process the following types of data:First nameLast nameEmail addressCompany nameStreet + house numberResidencePostcodeCountryDuring your registration, we process any data you enter, such as your username and password, along with data that is collected in the background such as your device information and IP addresses.When using your account, we process any data you enter while using the account, as well as any data that is created while you use our services.Storage timeWe store the entered data for at least as long as the account associated with the data exists with us and is in use \u2013 and as long as there are contractual obligations between you and us. In case the contract ends, we retain the data until the respective claims get time-barred. Moreover, we store your data as long as we are subject to legal storage obligations, if applicable. Following that, we keep any accounting records (invoices, contract documents, account statements, etc.) of the contract for 10 years (\u00a7 147 AO) and other relevant business documents for 6 years (\u00a7 247 HGB) after accrual.Right to objectYou have registered, entered data and want to revoke the data processing? Not a problem. As you can see above, you retain this right under the General Data Protection Regulation also at and after registration, login or account creation with us. Contact the Data Protection Officer above to exercise your rights. If you already have an account with us, you can easily view and manage your data and texts in your account.Legal BasisBy completing the registration process, you enter into a pre-contractual agreement with us, with the intention to conclude a contract of use for our platform (although there is no automatic payment obligation). You invest time to enter data and register and in return, we offer you our services after you log on to our system and view your customer account. We also meet our contractual obligations. Finally, we need to be able to email registered users about important changes. Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (implementation of pre-contractual measures, fulfilment of a contract) applies.Where applicable, we will ask for your consent, e.g. in case you voluntarily provide more data than is absolutely necessary, or in case we may ask you if we may send you advertising. Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent) applies in this matter.We also have a legitimate interest in knowing who who our clients or customers are, in order to get in touch if required. We also need to know who is using our services and whether they are being used in accordance with our terms of use, i.e. Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests) applies in this matter.Note: the following sections are to be ticked by users (as required):Registration with real namesSince business operations require us to know who our clients or customers are, registration is only possible with your real name (full name) and not with a pseudonym.Registration with pseudonymsYou can use a pseudonym for the registration, which means you don\u2019t have to register with your real name. This ensures that your real name cannot be processed by us.Storage of the IP addressDuring registration, login and account use, we store your IP address for security reasons in order to be able to determine legitimate use.Public ProfileUser profiles are publicly visible, i.e. parts of the profiles can also be viewed on the Internet without the need to enter a username and password.Two Factor Authentication (2FA)Two Factor Authentication (2FA) offers additional security when logging in, as it prevents you from logging in without a smartphone, for example. This technical measure to secure your account protects you against the loss of data or unauthorised access, even if your username and password were leaked. During your registration process, login or within the account itself y ou can find out which 2FA is used.Web hostingWeb hosting Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: visitors to the website\ud83d\udcd3 Purpose: professional hosting of the website and security of operations\ud83e\udd1d Processed data: IP address, time of website visit, browser used and other data. You can find more details on this below or at the respective web hosting provider.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage period: dependent on the respective provider, but usually 2 weeks\u2696\ufe0f Legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What is web hosting?Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information \u2013 including personal data \u2013 is automatically created and stored, including on this website. This data should be processed as sparingly as possible, and only with good reason. By website, we mean the entirety of all websites on your domain, i.e. everything from the homepage to the very last subpage (like this one here). By domain we mean example.uk or examplepage.com.When you want to view a website on a screen, you use a program called a web browser. You probably know the names of some web browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.The web browser has to connect to another computer which stores the website\u2019s code: the web server. Operating a web server is complicated and time-consuming, which is why this is usually done by professional providers. They offer web hosting and thus ensure the reliable and flawless storage of website data.Whenever the browser on your computer establishes a connection (desktop, laptop, smartphone) and whenever data is being transferred to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. After all, your computer stores data, and the web server also has to retain the data for a period of time in order to ensure it can operate properly.Illustration:Why do we process personal data?The purposes of data processing are:Professional hosting of the website and operational securityTo maintain the operational as well as IT securityAnonymous evaluation of access patterns to improve our offer, and if necessary, for prosecution or the pursuit of claims.li>Which data are processed?Even while you are visiting our website, our web server, that is the computer on which this website is saved, usually automatically saves data such asthe full address (URL) of the accessed website (e. g. https://www.examplepage.uk/examplesubpage.html?tid=122472826)browser and browser version (e.g. Chrome 87)the operating system used (e.g. Windows 10)the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e. g. https://www.examplepage.uk/icamefromhere.html/)the host name and the IP address of the device from the website is being accessed from (e.g. COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)date and timein so-called web server log filesHow long is the data stored?Generally, the data mentioned above are stored for two weeks and are then automatically deleted. We do not pass these data on to others, but we cannot rule out the possibility that this data may be viewed by the authorities in the event of illegal conduct.In short: Your visit is logged by our provider (company that runs our website on special computers (servers)), but we do not pass on your data without your consent!Legal basisThe lawfulness of processing personal data in the context of web hosting is justified in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (safeguarding of legitimate interests), as the use of professional hosting with a provider is necessary to present the company in a safe and user-friendly manner on the internet, as well as to have the ability to track any attacks and claims, if necessary.Hetzner Privacy PolicyWe use Hetzner for our website, which is a web hosting provider, among other things. The provider of this service is the German company Hetzner Online GmbH, Industriestr. 25, 91710 Gunzenhausen, Germany. You can find out more about the data that is processed through the use of Hetzner in their Privacy Policy at https://www.hetzner.com/de/rechtliches/datenschutz.Website Builders IntroductionWebsite Builders Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: service optimisation\ud83d\udcd3 Data processed: The data that is being processed includes but is not limited to technical usage information, browser activity, clickstream activity, session heat maps, contact details, IP addresses or geographic locations. You can find more details in the Privacy Policy below as well as in the providers\u2019 Privacy Policies.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: depends on the provider\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests), Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR (consent)What are website builders?We use a modular website builder for our website. This is a special form of Content Management System (CMS). Website builders enable website operators to create websites very easily and without any programming knowledge. In many cases, web hosts also offer website builders. Your personal data may be collected, stored and processed if a website builder is being used. In this Privacy Policy, you will find general information about data that is processed by such modular website builder systems. You can find more information in the respective provider\u2019s Privacy Policy.Why do we use website builders for our website?The greatest advantage of modular website builders is their ease of use. We want to offer you a clear, simple and nicely designed website that we can easily operate and maintain by ourselves \u2013 without needing any external support. Nowadays website builders offer many helpful functions that we can use even without having any programming knowledge. This enables us to design our website according to our wishes and therefore, to give you an informative and pleasant experience on our website.Which data are stored by website builders?First of all, the exact data that is stored depends on the website builder that is being used. Each provider processes and collects different data from website visitors. However, technical usage information such as users\u2019 operating system, browser, screen resolution, language and keyboard settings, hosting provider as well as the date of the website visit are usually collected. Moreover, tracking data (e. g. browser activity, clickstream activities, session heat maps, etc.) may also be processed. The same goes for personal data, since data such as contact information e. g. email address, telephone number (if you have provided it), IP address and geographic location data may also be processed and stored. In the respective provider\u2019s Privacy Policy you can find out exactly which of your data is getting stored.How long and where are the data stored?Provided that we have any further information on this, we will inform you below about the duration of the data processing associated with the website builder we use. You can find detailed information on this in the provider\u2019s Privacy Policy. Generally, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide our services and products. The provider may store your data according to their own specifications, over which we have no influence.Right to objectYou always retain the right to information, rectification and erasure of your personal data. If you have any questions, you can also contact the responsible parties at the respective website builder system at any time. You can find the corresponding contact details either in our Privacy Policy or on the website of the respective provider.What is more, in your browser you can clear, disable or manage cookies that providers use for their functions. Depending on the browser you use, this can be done in different ways. Please note, that this may lead to not all functions working as usual anymore.Legal BasesWe have a legitimate interest in using a website builder system to optimise our online service and present it in an efficient and user-friendly way. The corresponding legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use the website builder system if you have consented to it.If the processing of data is not absolutely necessary for the operation of the website, your data will only be processed on the basis of your consent. This particularly applies to tracking activities. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR.With this Privacy Policy, we have made you more familiar with the most important general information on data processing. If you want to find out more about this, you will find further information \u2013 if available \u2013 in the following section or in the Privacy Policy of the provider.Joomla! Privacy PolicyFor our website, we use Joomla!, which is a modular website system or a content management system (CMS). The provider of this service is the German company J and Beyond Verein zur F\u00f6rderung freier Content Management Systeme e.V. (J and Beyond Association for the Promotion of Free Content Management Systems) at Br\u00fcsseler Ring 67, c/o Robert Deutz Business Solution, 52074 Aachen, Germany. You can find out more about the data that is processed by using the Joomla! in their Privacy Policy at https://www.joomla.de/privacypolicy.WordPress.com Privacy PolicyWe use the well-known content management system WordPress.com for our website. The service provider is the American company Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.What is WordPress?The company was founded in 2003 and quickly developed into one of the most famous content management systems (CMS) worldwide. A CMS is a software that helps us design our website and display content beautifully and in an organized manner. The content can include text, audio, and video.By using WordPress, personal data about you may also be collected, stored, and processed. Typically, mainly technical data such as operating system, browser, screen resolution, or hosting provider are stored. However, personal data such as IP address, geographic data, or contact information may also be processed.Why do we use WordPress?Programming is not one of our core competencies. Nevertheless, we want to have a powerful and attractive website that we can manage and maintain ourselves. With a website builder system or a content management system like WordPress, this is possible. With WordPress, we don\u2019t need to be programming experts to offer you a beautiful website. Thanks to WordPress, we can quickly and easily operate our website even without technical knowledge. If technical problems arise or we have special requests for our website, we still have our experts who are familiar with HTML, PHP, CSS, and the like.How secure is the data transfer with WordPress?WordPress processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. WordPress is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. More information can be found at https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en.Additionally, WordPress uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (Article 46(2) and (3) GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, WordPress commits to maintaining the European data protection level when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding Standard Contractual Clauses here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847.The data processing conditions (Data Processing Agreements), which correspond to the standard contractual clauses, can be found at https://wordpress.com/support/data-processing-agreements/.You can learn more about the data processed through the use of WordPress.com in the privacy policy at https://automattic.com/de/privacy/.Web AnalyticsWeb Analytics Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: visitors to the website\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: Evaluation of visitor information to optimise the website.\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: Access statistics that contain data such as access location, device data, access duration and time, navigation behaviour, click behaviour and IP addresses. You can find more details on this from the respective web analytics tool directly.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage period: depending on the respective web analytics tool used\u2696\ufe0f Legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What is Web Analytics?We use software on our website, which is known as web analytics, in order to evaluate website visitor behaviour. Thus, data is collected, which the analytic tool provider (also called tracking tool) stores, manages and processes. Analyses of user behaviour on our website are created with this data, which we as the website operator receive. Most tools also offer various testing options. These enable us, to for example test which offers or content our visitors prefer. For this, we may show you two different offers for a limited period of time. After the test (a so-called A/B test) we know which product or content our website visitors find more interesting. For such testing as well as for various other analyses, user profiles are created and the respective data is stored in cookies.Why do we run Web Analytics?We have a clear goal in mind when it comes to our website: we want to offer our industry\u2019s best website on the market. Therefore, we want to give you both, the best and most interesting offer as well as comfort when you visit our website. With web analysis tools, we can observe the behaviour of our website visitors, and then improve our website accordingly for you and for us. For example, we can see the average age of our visitors, where they come from, the times our website gets visited the most, and which content or products are particularly popular. All this information helps us to optimise our website and adapt it to your needs, interests and wishes.Which data are processed?The exact data that is stored depends on the analysis tools that are being used. But generally, data such as the content you view on our website are stored, as well as e. g. which buttons or links you click, when you open a page, which browser you use, which device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) you visit the website with, or which computer system you use. If you have agreed that location data may also be collected, this data may also be processed by the provider of the web analysis tool.Moreover, your IP address is also stored. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), IP addresses are personal data. However, your IP address is usually stored in a pseudonymised form (i.e. in an unrecognisable and abbreviated form). No directly linkable data such as your name, age, address or email address are stored for testing purposes, web analyses and web optimisations. If this data is collected, it is retained in a pseudonymised form. Therefore, it cannot be used to identify you as a person.The following example shows Google Analytics\u2019 functionality as an example for client-based web tracking with JavaScript code.The storage period of the respective data always depends on the provider.

You can find more details on this in the privacy policy below.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage period: Customizable, GA4 stores data for 14 months by default.\u2696\ufe0f Legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What is Google Analytics?On our website, we use the analytics tracking tool Google Analytics in the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) version provided by the American company Google Inc. For the European region, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services. Google Analytics collects data about your actions on our website. By combining various technologies such as cookies, device IDs, and login information, you can be identified as a user across different devices. This allows your actions to be analyzed across platforms as well.For example, when you click on a link, this event is stored in a cookie and sent to Google Analytics. With the reports we receive from Google Analytics, we can better tailor our website and service to your needs. In the following, we will provide more information about the tracking tool and specifically inform you about the data processed and how you can prevent it.Google Analytics is a tracking tool used for website traffic analysis. The basis for these measurements and analyses is a pseudonymous user identification number. This number does not include personally identifiable information such as name or address but is used to assign events to a device. GA4 utilizes an event-based model that captures detailed information about user interactions such as page views, clicks, scrolling, and conversion events. Additionally, GA4 incorporates various machine learning features to better understand user behavior and certain trends. GA4 employs modeling through machine learning capabilities, meaning that based on the collected data, missing data can be extrapolated to optimize the analysis and provide forecasts.In order for Google Analytics to function properly, a tracking code is embedded in the code of our website. When you visit our website, this code records various events that you perform on our website. With GA4\u2019s event-based data model, we, as website operators, can define and track specific events to obtain analyses of user interactions. This allows us to track not only general information such as clicks or page views but also specific events that are important for our business, such as submitting a contact form or making a purchase.Once you leave our website, this data is sent to and stored on Google Analytics servers.Google processes the data, and we receive reports on your user behavior. These reports can include, among others, the following:Audience reports: Audience reports help us get to know our users better and gain a more precise understanding of who is interested in our service.Advertising reports: Advertising reports make it easier for us to analyze and improve our online advertising.Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide helpful information on how we can attract more people to our service.Behavior reports: Here, we learn about how you interact with our website. We can track the path you take on our site and which links you click on.Conversion reports: Conversion refers to an action you take as a result of a marketing message, such as going from being a website visitor to becoming a buyer or newsletter subscriber. Through these reports, we gain insights into how our marketing efforts resonate with you, with the aim of improving our conversion rate.Real-time reports: With real-time reports, we can see what is currently happening on our website. For example, we can see how many users are currently reading this text.In addition to the above-mentioned analysis reports, Google Analytics 4 also offers the following functions:Event-based data model: This model captures specific events that can occur on our website, such as playing a video, making a purchase, or subscribing to our newsletter.Advanced analytics features: With these features, we can gain a better understanding of your behavior on our website or certain general trends. For example, we can segment user groups, conduct comparative analyses of target audiences, or track your path on our website.Predictive modeling: Based on the collected data, missing data can be extrapolated through machine learning to predict future events and trends. This can help us develop better marketing strategies.Cross-platform analysis: Data collection and analysis are possible from both websites and apps. This enables us to analyze user behavior across platforms, provided you have consented to data processing.Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?Our goal with this website is clear: we want to provide you with the best possible service. The statistics and data from Google Analytics help us achieve this goal.The statistically evaluated data gives us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On one hand, we can optimize our site to make it more easily found by interested people on Google. On the other hand, the data helps us better understand you as a visitor. We know exactly what we need to improve on our website in order to provide you with the best possible service. The data also helps us conduct our advertising and marketing activities in a more personalized and cost-effective manner. After all, it only makes sense to show our products and services to people who are interested in them.What data is stored by Google Analytics?With the help of a tracking code, Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID associated with your browser cookie. This way, Google Analytics recognizes you as a new user, and a user ID is assigned to you. When you visit our site again, you are recognized as a \u201creturning\u201d user. All collected data is stored together with this user ID, making it possible to evaluate pseudonymous user profiles.To analyze our website with Google Analytics, a property ID must be inserted into the tracking code. The data is then stored in the corresponding property. For each newly created property, the default is Google Analytics 4 Property. The data storage duration varies depending on the property used.Through identifiers such as cookies, app instance IDs, user IDs, or custom event parameters, your interactions, if you have consented, are measured across platforms. Interactions encompass all types of actions you perform on our website. If you also use other Google systems (such as a Google account), data generated through Google Analytics can be linked to third-party cookies. Google does not disclose Google Analytics data unless we, as website operators, authorize it, except when required by law.According to Google, IP addresses are not logged or stored in Google Analytics 4. However, IP address data is used by Google for deriving location data and is immediately deleted thereafter. All IP addresses collected from users in the EU are deleted before the data is stored in a data center or on a server.Since GA4 focuses on event-based data, the tool uses significantly fewer cookies compared to previous versions such as Google Universal Analytics. However, there are still some specific cookies used by GA4. These can include:Name: _gaValue: 2.1326744211.152122472826-5Purpose: By default, analytics.js uses the _ga cookie to store the user ID. It is used to distinguish website visitors.Expiration: After 2 yearsName: _gidValue: 2.1687193234.152122472826-1Purpose: This cookie is also used to distinguish website visitors.Expiration: After 24 hoursName: gat_gtag_UA Value: 1Purpose: Used to reduce the request rate. If Google Analytics is deployed via Google Tag Manager, this cookie will be named dc_gtm .Expiration: After 1 minuteNote: This list cannot claim to be exhaustive, as Google may change their choice of cookies from time to time. GA4 aims to improve data privacy and offers several options for controlling data collection. For example, we can determine the storage duration ourselves and control data.Here we provide an overview of the main types of data collected by Google Analytics:Heatmaps: Google creates heatmaps to show the exact areas you click on. This provides us with information about your interactions on our site.Session Duration: Google refers to session duration as the time you spend on our site without leaving. If you are inactive for 20 minutes, the session automatically ends.Bounce Rate: Bounce rate refers to when you view only one page on our website and then leave.Account Creation: If you create an account or place an order on our website, Google Analytics collects this data.Location: IP addresses are not logged or stored in Google Analytics. However, location data is derived shortly before the IP address is deleted.Technical Information: Technical information includes your browser type, internet service provider, and screen resolution, among others.Source of Origin: Google Analytics is interested in the website or advertisement that brought you to our site.Additional data may include contact information, reviews, media playback (e.g., if you play a video on our site), sharing of content via social media, or adding to favorites. This list is not exhaustive and serves only as a general guide to the data storage by Google Analytics.Where and how long are the data stored?Google has servers distributed worldwide. You can find precise information about the locations of Google data centers at: https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=enYour data is distributed across multiple physical storage devices. This ensures faster access to data and better protection against manipulation. Each Google data center has emergency programs in place for your data. In the event of hardware failure or natural disasters, the risk of service interruption at Google remains low.The retention period of data depends on the properties used. The storage duration is always set separately for each individual property. Google Analytics offers us four options for controlling the storage duration:2 months: This is the shortest storage period.14 months: By default, data is stored in GA4 for 14 months.26 months: Data can also be stored for 26 months.Data is only deleted manually.In addition, there is also the option for data to be deleted only if you do not visit our website within the selected time period. In this case, the retention period is reset every time you revisit our website within the defined time frame.Once the defined period has expired, the data is deleted once a month. This retention period applies to data linked to cookies, user identification, and advertising IDs (e.g., cookies from the DoubleClick domain). Report results are based on aggregated data and are stored independently of user data. Aggregated data is a combination of individual data into larger units.How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?Under the data protection laws of the European Union, you have the right to access, update, delete, or restrict your data. By using the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics JavaScript (analytics.js, gtag.js), you can prevent Google Analytics 4 from using your data. You can download and install the browser add-on at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en Please note that this add-on only disables data collection by Google Analytics.If you want to disable, delete, or manage cookies in general, you can find the respective instructions for the most common browsers in the \u201cCookies\u201d section.Legal basisThe use of Google Analytics requires your consent, which we obtained through our cookie popup. According to Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR, this consent constitutes the legal basis for the processing of personal data that may occur during the collection by web analytics tools.In addition to consent, we also have a legitimate interest in analyzing the behavior of website visitors to improve our offering technically and economically. By using Google Analytics, we can identify website errors, detect attacks, and improve efficiency. The legal basis for this is Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use Google Analytics if you have given your consent.Google processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. Google is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. More information can be found at https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en.Additionally, Google uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (Article 46(2) and (3) GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, Google commits to maintaining the European data protection level when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding Standard Contractual Clauses here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847.You can find the Google Ads Data Processing Terms, which refer to the Standard Contractual Clauses, at: https://business.safety.google/intl/en/adsprocessorterms/We hope we have provided you with the most important information regarding the data processing by Google Analytics. If you want to learn more about the tracking service, we recommend the following links: https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/en/ and https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=enIf you want to learn more about data processing, you can refer to the Google Privacy Policy at: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en.Google Analytics Reports on demographic characteristics and interestsWe have turned on Google Analytics\u2019 functions for advertising reports. These reports on demographic characteristics and interests contain details about age, gender and interests. Through them we can get a better picture of our users \u2013 without being able to allocate any data to individual persons. You can learn more about advertising functions at auf https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=en&amp%3Butm_id=ad.You can terminate the use of your Google Account\u2019s activities and information in \u201cAds Settings\u201d at https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated via a checkbox.Google Analytics Google Signals Privacy PolicyWe have activated Google signals in Google Analytics. Through this, any existing Google Analytics functions (advertising reports, remarketing, cross-device reports and reports on interests and demographic characteristics) are updated, to result in the summary and anonymisation of your data, should you have permitted personalised ads in your Google Account.The special aspect of this is that it involves cross-device tracking. That means your data can be analysed across multiple devices. Through the activation of Google signals, data is collected and linked to the Google account. For example, it enables Google to recognise when you look at a product on a smartphone and later buy the product on a laptop. Due to activating Google signals, we can start cross-device remarketing campaigns, which would otherwise not be possible to this extent. Remarketing means, that we can show you our products and services across other websites as well.Moreover, further visitor data such as location, search history, YouTube history and data about your actions on our website are collected in Google Analytics. As a result, we receive improved advertising reports and more useful information on your interests and demographic characteristics. These include your age, the language you speak, where you live or what your gender is. Certain social criteria such as your job, your marital status or your income are also included. All these characteristics help Google Analytics to define groups of persons or target audiences.Those reports also help us to better assess your behaviour, as well as your wishes and interests. As a result, we can optimise and customise our products and services for you. By default, this data expires after 26 months. Please consider, that this data is only collected if you have agreed to personalised advertisement in your Google Account. The retained information is always exclusively summarised and anonymous data, and never any data on individual persons. You can manage or delete this data in your Google Account.Google Analytics in Consent ModeDepending on your consent, Google Analytics will progress your personal data in the so-called \u201cconsent mode\u201d. You can choose whether or not you want to accept Google Analytics cookies, and thus which of your data Google Analytics may process. The retained data is mainly used to measure user behaviour on the website, to serve targeted advertising and to provide us with web analysis reports. Usually, you would consent to Google\u2019s data processing via a cookie consent tool. If you do not consent to data processing, only aggregated data will be collected and processed. This means that data cannot be assigned to individual users and therefore no user profile will be created for you. You also have the option to only agree to statistical measurement, meaning that none of your personal data will be processed and used for advertising or advertising measurement sequences.Google Analytics IP AnonymisationWe implemented Google Analytics\u2019 IP address anonymisation to this website. Google developed this function, so this website can comply with the applicable privacy laws and the local data protection authorities\u2019 recommendations, should they prohibit the retention of any full IP addresses.The anonymisation or masking of IP addresses takes place, as soon as they reach Google Analytics\u2019 data collection network, but before the data would be saved or processed.You can find more information on IP anonymisation at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en.Google Remarketing Privacy PolicyWe use Google Remarketing, an advertising analysis tool, for our website.

(1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) for our website.This Tag Manager is one of Google\u2019s many helpful marketing products. With it, we can centrally integrate and manage code sections of various tracking tools, that we use on our website.In this privacy statement we will explain in more detail, what Google Tag Manager does, why we use it and to what extent your data is processed.Google Tag Manager is an organising tool with which we can integrate and manage website tags centrally and via a user interface. Tags are little code sections which e.g. track your activities on our website. For this, segments of JavaScript code are integrated to our site\u2019s source text. The tags often come from Google\u2019s intern products, such as Google Ads or Google Analytics, but tags from other companies can also be integrated and managed via the manager. Since the tags have different tasks, they can collect browser data, feed marketing tools with data, embed buttons, set cookies and track users across several websites.Why do we use Google Tag Manager for our website?Everybody knows: Being organised is important! Of course, this also applies to maintenance of our website. In order to organise and design our website as well as possible for you and anyone who is interested in our products and services, we rely on various tracking tools, such as Google Analytics.The collected data shows us what interests you most, which of our services we should improve, and which other persons we should also display our services to. Furthermore, for this tracking to work, we must implement relevant JavaScript Codes to our website. While we could theoretically integrate every code section of every tracking tool separately into our source text, this would take too much time and we would lose overview. This is the reason why we use Google Tag Manager. We can easily integrate the necessary scripts and manage them from one place. Additionally, Google Tag Manager\u2019s user interface is easy to operate, and requires no programming skills. Therefore, we can easily keep order in our jungle of tags.What data is stored by Google Tag Manager?Tag Manager itself is a domain that neither uses cookies nor stores data. It merely functions as an \u201cadministrator\u201c of implemented tags. Data is collected by the individual tags of the different web analysis tools. Therefore, in Google Tag Manager the data is sent to the individual tracking tools and does not get saved.However, with the integrated tags of different web analysis tools such as Google Analytics, this is quite different. Depending on the analysis tool used, various data on your internet behaviour is collected, stored and processed with the help of cookies. Please read our texts on data protection for more information on the articular analysis and tracking tools we use on our website.We allowed Google via the account settings for the Tag Manager to receive anonymised data from us. However, this exclusively refers to the use of our Tag Manager and not to your data, which are saved via code sections. We allow Google and others, to receive selected data in anonymous form. Therefore, we agree to the anonymised transfer of our website data. However, even after extensive research we could not find out what summarised and anonymous data it is exactly that gets transmitted. What we do know is that Google deleted any info that could identify our website. Google combines the data with hundreds of other anonymous website data and creates user trends as part of benchmarking measures. Benchmarking is a process of comparing a company\u2019s results with the ones of competitors. As a result, processes can be optimised based on the collected information.How long and where is the data stored?When Google stores data, this is done on Google\u2019s own servers. These servers are located all over the world, with most of them being in America. At https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en you can read in detail where Google\u2019s servers are.In our individual data protection texts on the different tools you can find out how long the respective tracking tools store your data.How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?Google Tag Manager itself does not set any cookies but manages different tracking websites\u2019 tags. In our data protection texts on the different tracking tools you can find detailed information on how you can delete or manage your data.Please note that when using this tool, your data may also be stored and processed outside the EU. Most third countries (including the USA) are not considered secure under current European data protection law.

Most of this data is stored in cookies.

Facebook is a social media network of the company Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland. With the aid of this tool we can provide the best possible offers to you and anyone interested in our products and services.If your data is collected and forwarded via our embedded Facebook elements or via our Facebook page (fanpage), both we and Facebook Ireland Ltd. are responsible for this. However, should any further processing occur, then Facebook is solely responsible for this data. Our joint commitments were also set out in a publicly available agreement at https://www.facebook. com / legal / controller_addendum . It e.g. states that we must clearly inform you about the use of Facebook tools on our website. We are also responsible for ensuring that the tools are securely integrated into our website and are in accordance with the applicable privacy laws. Facebook, on the other hand, is e.g. responsible for the data security of Facebook\u2019s products. If you have any questions about Facebook\u2019s data collection and processing, you can contact the company directly. Should you direct the question to us, we are obliged to forward it to Facebook.In the following we will give you an overview on the different Facebook tools, as well as on what data is sent to Facebook and how you can erase this data.Along with many other products, Facebook also offers so called \u201cFacebook Business Tools\u201d. This is Facebook\u2019s official name for its tools, but it is not very common. Therefore, we decided to merely call them \u201cFacebook tools\u201d. They include the following:Facebook-PixelSocial Plugins (e.g. the \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cShare\u201c button)Facebook LoginAccount KitAPIs (application programming interface)SDKs (Softwart developmept kits)Plattform-integrationsPluginsCodesSpecificationsDocumentationsTechnologies and ServicesWith these tools Facebook can extend its services and is able to receive information on user activities outside of Facebook.Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?We only want to show our services and products to people who are genuinely interested in them. With the help of advertisements (Facebook Ads) we can reach exactly these people. However, to be able to show suitable adverts to users, Facebook requires additional information on people\u2019s needs and wishes. Therefore, information on the user behaviour (and contact details) on our website, are provided to Facebook. Consequently, Facebook can collect better user data and is able to display suitable adverts for our products or services. Thanks to the tools it is possible to create targeted, customised ad campaigns of Facebook.Facebook calls data about your behaviour on our website \u201cevent data\u201d and uses them for analytics services. That way, Facebook can create \u201ccampaign reports\u201d about our ad campaigns\u2019 effectiveness on our behalf. Moreover, by analyses we can get a better insight in how you use our services, our website or our products. Therefore, some of these tools help us optimise your user experience on our website. With the social plugins for instance, you can share our site\u2019s contents directly on Facebook.What data is stored by Facebook tools?With the use of Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) may be sent to Facebook. Depending on the tools used, customer data such as name, address, telephone number and IP address may be transmitted.Facebook uses this information to match the data with the data it has on you (if you are a Facebook member). However, before the customer data is transferred to Facebook, a so called \u201cHashing\u201d takes place. This means, that a data record of any size is transformed into a string of characters, which also has the purpose of encrypting data.Moreover, not only contact data, but also \u201cevent data\u201c is transferred. These data are the information we receive about you on our website. To give an example, it allows us to see what subpages you visit or what products you buy from us. Facebook does not disclose the obtained information to third parties (such as advertisers), unless the company has an explicit permission or is legally obliged to do so. Also, \u201cevent data\u201c can be linked to contact information, which helps Facebook to offer improved, customised adverts. Finally, after the previously mentioned matching process, Facebook deletes the contact data.To deliver optimised advertisements, Facebook only uses event data, if they have been combined with other data (that have been collected by Facebook in other ways). Facebook also uses event data for the purposes of security, protection, development and research. Many of these data are transmitted to Facebook via cookies. Cookies are little text files, that are used for storing data or information in browsers. Depending on the tools used, and on whether you are a Facebook member, a different number of cookies are placed in your browser. In the descriptions of the individual Facebook tools we will go into more detail on Facebook cookies. You can also find general information about the use of Facebook cookies at https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies.How long and where are the data stored?Facebook fundamentally stores data, until they are no longer of use for their own services and products. Facebook has servers for storing their data all around the world. However, customer data is cleared within 48 hours after they have been matched with their own user data.How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data.The collected data is only fully deleted, when you delete your entire Facebook account. Deleting your Facebook account works as follows:1) Click on settings in the top right side in Facebook.2) Then, click \u201cYour Facebook information\u201c in the left column.3) Now click on \u201cDeactivation and deletion\u201d.4) Choose \u201cPermanently delete account\u201c and then click on \u201cContinue to account deletion\u201c.5) Enter your password, click on \u201ccontinue\u201c and then on \u201cDelete account\u201c.The retention of data Facebook receives via our site is done via cookies (e.g. with social plugins), among others.

The following instructions show, how to manage cookies in your browser:Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in ChromeSafari: Manage cookies and website data in SafariFirefox: Clear cookies and site data in FirefoxInternet Explorer: Delete and manage cookiesMicrosoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft EdgeIf you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser to notify you whenever a cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to decide upon the permission or deletion of every single cookie.Legal basisIf you have consented to your data being processed and stored by integrated Facebook tools, this consent is the legal basis for data processing (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). Generally, your data is also stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) to maintain fast and good communication with you or other customers and business partners. Nevertheless, we only use these tools if you have given your consent. Most social media platforms also set cookies on your browser to store data.

Instagram is a social media platform of the company Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Rd, Menlo Park CA 94025, USA. Since 2012, Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook Inc. and is a part of Facebook\u2019s products. The inclusion of Instagram\u2019s contents on our website is called embedding. With this, we can show you Instagram contents such as buttons, photos or videos directly on our website. If you open websites of our online presence, that have an integrated Instagram function, data gets transmitted to, as well as stored and processed by Instagram. Instagram uses the same systems and technologies as Facebook. Therefore, your data will be processed across all Facebook firms.In the following, we want to give you a more detailed insight on why Instagram collects data, what data these are and how you can control data processing. As Instagram belongs to Facebook Inc., we have, on the one hand received this information from the Instagram guidelines, and on the other hand from Facebook\u2019s Data Policy.Instagram is one of the most famous social media networks worldwide. Instagram combines the benefits of a blog with the benefits of audio-visual platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. To \u201cInsta\u201c (how the platform is casually called by many users) you can upload photos and short videos, edit them with different filters and also share them to other social networks. Also, if you do not want to be active on Instagram yourself, you can just follow other interesting users.Why do we use Instagram on our website?Instagram is a social media platform whose success has skyrocketed within recent years. Naturally, we have also reacted to this boom. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible on our website. Therefore, we attach great importance to diversified contents. With the embedded Instagram features we can enrich our content with helpful, funny or exciting Instagram contents. Since Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook, the collected data can also serve us for customised advertising on Facebook. Hence, only persons who are genuinely interested in our products or services can see our ads.Instagram also uses the collected data for tracking and analysis purposes. We receive summarised statistics and therefore more insight to your wishes and interests. It is important to mention that these reports do not identify you personally.What data is stored by Instagram?Whenever you land on one of our sites, which have Instagram functions (i.e. Instagram photos or plugins) integrated to them, your browser automatically connects with Instagram\u2019s servers. Thereby, data is sent to, as well as saved and processed by Instagram. This always happens, whether you have an Instagram account or not. Moreover, it includes information on our website, your computer, your purchases, the advertisements you see and on how you use our offer. The date and time of your interaction is also stored. If you have an Instagram account or are logged in, Instagram saves significantly more data on you.Facebook distinguishes between customer data and event data. We assume this is also the case for Instagram. Customer data are for example names, addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses. These data are only transmitted to Instagram, if they have been \u201chashed\u201d first. Thereby, a set of data is transformed into a string of characters, which encrypts any contact data. Moreover, the aforementioned \u201cevent data\u201c (data on your user behaviour) is transmitted as well. It is also possible, that contact data may get combined with event data. The collected data data is matched with any data Instagram already has on you.Furthermore, the gathered data are transferred to Facebook via little text files (cookies) which usually get set in your browser. Depending on the Instagram function used, and whether you have an Instagram account yourself, the amount of data that gets stored varies.We assume data processing on Instagram works the same way as on Facebook. Therefore, if you have an account on Instagram or have visited www.instagram.com, Instagram has set at least one cookie. If this is the case, your browser uses the cookie to send information to Instagram, as soon as you come across an Instagram function. No later than 90 days (after matching) the data is deleted or anonymised. Even though we have studied Instagram\u2019s data processing in-depth, we cannot tell for sure what exact data Instagram collects and retains.In the following we will show you a list of the least cookies placed in your browser when click on an Instagram function (e.g. button or an Insta picture). In our test we assume you do not have an Instagram account, since if you would be logged in to your Instagram account, your browser would place significantly more cookies.The following cookies were used in our test:Name: csrftokenValue: \u201c\u201dPurpose: This cookie is most likely set for security reasons to prevent falsifications of requests. We could not find out more information on it.Expiry date: after one yearName: midValue: \u201c\u201dPurpose: Instagram places this cookie to optimise its own offers and services in- and outside of Instagram.

The cookies that are placed in each individual case, depend on the functions embedded as well as on your use of Instagram.How long and where are these data stored?Instagram shares the information obtained within the Facebook businesses with external partners and persons you are globally connected with. Data processing is done according to Facebook\u2019s internal data policy. Your data is distributed to Facebook\u2019s servers across the world, partially for security reasons. Most of these servers are in the USA.How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?Thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data. Furthermore, you can manage your data in Instagram\u2019s settings. If you want to delete your data on Instagram completely, you will have to delete your Instagram account permanently.And this is how an Instagram account can be deleted:First, open the Instagram app. Then, navigate to your profile page, select the three bars in the top right, choose \u201cSettings\u201d and then click \u201cHelp\u201d. Now, you will be redirected to the company\u2019s website, where you must click on \u201cManaging Your Account\u201d and then \u201cDelete Your Account\u201d.When you delete your account completely, Instagram deletes posts such as your photos and status updates. Any information other people shared about you are not a part of your account and do therefore not get deleted.As mentioned before, Instagram primarily stores your data via cookies. You can manage, deactivate or delete these cookies in your browser. Depending on your browser, managing them varies a bit. We will show you the instructions of the most relevant browsers here.Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in ChromeSafari: Manage cookies and website data in SafariFirefox: Clear cookies and site data in FirefoxInternet Explorer: Delete and manage cookiesMicrosoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft EdgeGenerally, you can set your browser to notify you whenever a cookie is about to be set.

Social plugins can be feeds, content sharing or a link to our LinkedIn page. Social plugins are clearly marked with the well-known LinkedIn logo and for example allow sharing interesting content directly via our website. Moreover, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company Wilton Place in Dublin is responsible for data processing in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.By embedding these plugins, data can be sent to, as well as stored and processed by LinkedIn. In this privacy policy we want to inform you what data this is, how the network uses this data and how you can manage or prevent data retention.LinkedIn is the largest social network for business contacts. In contrast to e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn focuses exclusively on establishing business connections. Therefore, companies can present services and products on the platform and establish business relationships. Many people also use LinkedIn to find a job or to find suitable employees for their own company. In Germany alone, the network has over 11 million members. In Austria there are about 1.3 million.Why do we use LinkedIn on our website?We know how busy you are. You just cannot keep up with following every single social media channel. Even if it would really be worth it, as it is with our channels, since we keep posting interesting news and articles worth spreading. Therefore, on our website we have created the opportunity to share interesting content directly on LinkedIn, or to refer directly to our LinkedIn page. We consider built-in social plugins as an extended service on our website. The data LinkedIn collects also help us to display potential advertising measures only to people who are interested in our offer.What data are stored by LinkedIn?LinkedIn stores no personal data due to the mere integration of social plugins. LinkedIn calls the data generated by plugins passive impressions. However, if you click on a social plugin to e.g. share our content, the platform stores personal data as so-called \u201cactive impressions\u201d. This happens regardless of whether you have a LinkedIn account or not. If you are logged in, the collected data will be assigned to your account.When you interact with our plugins, your browser establishes a direct connection to LinkedIn\u2019s servers. Through that, the company logs various usage data. These may include your IP address, login data, device information or information about your internet or cellular provider. If you use LinkedIn services via your smartphone, your location may also be identified (after you have given permission). Moreover, LinkedIn can share these data with third-party advertisers in \u201chashed\u201d form. Hashing means that a data set is transformed into a character string. This allows data to be encrypted, which prevents persons from getting identified.Most data on of your user behaviour is stored in cookies. These are small text files that usually get placed in your browser. Furthermore, LinkedIn can also use web beacons, pixel tags, display tags and other device recognitions.Various tests also show which cookies are set when a user interacts with a social plug-in. We do not claim for the information we found to be exhaustive, as it only serves as an example. The following cookies were set without being logged in to LinkedIn:Name: bcookieValue: =2&34aab2aa-2ae1-4d2a-8baf-c2e2d7235c16122472826-Purpose:\u00a0This cookie is a so-called \u201cbrowser ID cookie\u201d and stores your identification number (ID).Expiry date: after 2 yearsName: langValue: v=2&lang=en-gbPurpose:This cookie saves your default or preferred language.Expiry date: after end of sessionName: lidcValue: 1818367:t=1571904767:s=AQF6KNnJ0G122472826\u2026Purpose:This cookie is used for routing.

LinkedIn describes it as a secure browser ID cookie.Expiry date: after 2 yearsName: fidValue: AQHj7Ii23ZBcqAAAA\u2026Purpose: We could not find any further information about this cookie.Expiry date: after 7 daysNote: LinkedIn also works with third parties. That is why we identified the Google Analytics cookies _ga and _gat in our test.How long and where are the data stored?In general, LinkedIn retains your personal data for as long as the company considers it necessary for providing its services. However, LinkedIn deletes your personal data when you delete your account. In some exceptional cases, LinkedIn keeps some summarised and anonymised data, even account deletions. As soon as you delete your account, it may take up to a day until other people can no longer see your data. LinkedIn generally deletes the data within 30 days. However, LinkedIn retains data if it is necessary for legal reasons. Also, data that can no longer be assigned to any person remains stored even after the account is closed. The data are stored on various servers in America and presumably also in Europe.How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?You have the right to access and delete your personal data at any time. In your LinkedIn account you can manage, change and delete your data. Moreover, you can request a copy of your personal data from LinkedIn.How to access account data in your LinkedIn profile:In LinkedIn, click on your profile icon and select the \u201cSettings & Privacy\u201d section. Now click on \u201cPrivacy\u201d and then on the section \u201cHow LinkedIn uses your data on\u201d. Then, click \u201cChange\u201d in the row with \u201cManage your data and activity\u201d. There you can instantly view selected data on your web activity and your account history.In your browser you also have the option of preventing data processing by LinkedIn. As mentioned above, LinkedIn stores most data via cookies that are placed in your browser. You can manage, deactivate or delete these cookies. Depending on which browser you have, these settings work a little different. You can find the instructions for the most common browsers here:Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in ChromeSafari: Manage cookies and website data in SafariFirefox: Clear cookies and site data in FirefoxInternet Explorer: Delete and manage cookiesMicrosoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft EdgeYou can generally set your browser to always notify you when a cookie is about to be set. Then you can always decide individually whether you want to allow the cookie or not.Legal basisIf you have consented to the processing and storage of your data by integrated social media elements, your consent is the legal basis for data processing (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). Generally, your data is also stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) to maintain fast and good communication with you or other customers and business partners. We only use the integrated social media elements if you have given your consent. Most social media platforms also place cookies in your browser to store data. We therefore recommend you to read our privacy policy about cookies carefully and take a look at the privacy policy or the cookie policy of the respective service provider.LinkedIn also processes data in the USA, among other countries. We would like to note, that according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA. This can be associated with various risks to the legality and security of data processing.LinkedIn uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission as the basis for data processing by recipients based in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and especially in the USA) or data transfer there (= Art. 46, paragraph 2 and 3 of the GDPR). These clauses oblige LinkedIn to comply with the EU\u2019s level of data protection when processing relevant data outside the EU. These clauses are based on an implementing order by the EU Commission. You can find the order and the clauses here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847We have tried to provide you with the most important information about data processing by LinkedIn.

Users can exchange ideas about various hobbies and interests via Pinterest and view profiles with pictures openly or in defined groups.Why do we use Pinterest?The social media platform Pinterest has been around for a few years now and is still one of the most visited and valued platforms. Pinterest is particularly suitable for our industry because the platform is primarily known for beautiful and interesting images. That is why we are of course also represented on Pinterest and want to put our content in the limelight in places other than our website. The collected data may also be used for advertising purposes, so we can show advertising messages to precisely those people who are interested in our services or products.Which data are processed by Pinterest?Pinterest may store so-called log data. This includes information about your browser, IP address, our website address and the your activities on it (e.g. when you click the save or pin button), along with your search history, the date and time of the request as well as cookie and device data. If you interact with an embedded Pinterest function, cookies that store various data may also be set in your browser. Most of the above-mentioned log data, as well as preset language settings and clickstream data are stored in cookies. Pinterest considers clickstream data as information about your website behaviour.If you have a Pinterest account yourself and are logged in, the data collected via our site may be linked to your account and used for advertising purposes.

As soon as the storage of this data is no longer necessary, e.g. for the compliance with legal regulations, the data is either erased or anonymised so you can no longer be identified as a person. The data may also be stored on American servers.Right to objectYou also have the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers such as Pinterest at any time.

TikTok is a popular social media platform, especially among young people, where users can create, share, and view short video clips.In this privacy policy, we inform you about the data processed by TikTok, how long the data is stored, and how you can manage your privacy settings.Why do we use TikTok on our website?We have incorporated TikTok into our website so that you can watch TikTok videos if you wish and potentially interact with the videos. TikTok is known for its funny and creative content, and naturally, we don\u2019t want to withhold such content from you. After all, we also enjoy watching creative TikTok videos ourselves.What data is processed by TikTok?When you watch TikTok videos on our website or interact with them, TikTok may collect information about your usage behavior and your device. This may include data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, location, and other technical information.

TikTok may also store data on servers in the United States and other countries. The storage duration typically complies with applicable legal requirements and internal policies. However, we have not been able to determine the exact duration of data storage. We will inform you as soon as we have more information on this matter.How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?If you have a TikTok account, you can manage your privacy settings directly on TikTok. For example, in the settings of your TikTok account, you can specify which information can be shared and which cannot. Additionally, you can manage and disable cookies in your web browser to limit data collection. This is also possible without a TikTok account. However, please note that this may affect the functionality of our website and your TikTok experience.Legal basisIf you have consented to TikTok processing and storing your data, this consent serves as the legal basis for data processing (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). In general, your data is also stored and processed based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in effective and efficient communication with you or other customers and business partners. However, we only use embedded social media elements if you have given your consent. TikTok may also set cookies in your browser to store data. Therefore, we recommend that you read our cookie privacy text carefully and view the privacy policy or cookie policies of the respective service provider.TikTok processes data from you, including in the United States. We would like to inform you that, according to the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfer to the United States. This may entail various risks for the legality and security of data processing.As the basis for data processing with recipients based in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, especially in the United States) or data transfers to such countries, TikTok uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (= Art. 46 para. 2 and 3 GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are model templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the United States).

These include embedded tweets, timelines, buttons, or hashtags, for example. X is a short messaging service and social media platform provided by the American company X Corp., located at 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. For the European region, Twitter International Unlimited Company (One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, D02 AX07, Ireland) is responsible for processing personal data.To our knowledge, in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, a mere integration of the X function does not transfer any personal data or data about your web activities to X. Only when you interact with the X functions, such as by clicking a button, data could be sent to X and get saved as well as processed there. We have no influence on this processing of data and do not bare any responsibility for it. Within this privacy statement, we want to give you an overview of what data X stores, what X does with this data and how you can largely protect yourself from data transmission.For some, X is a news service, for others, a social media platform, and for others still it is a microblogging service. All these terms are justified and mean pretty much the same.Both individuals as well as companies use X for communicating with interested people via short messages. X only allows 280 characters per message. These messages are called \u201ctweets\u201d. In contrast to Facebook, for example, the service does not focus on the expansion of a network of \u201cfriends\u201d, but strives to be regarded as an open, worldwide news platform. On X you can also have an anonymous account and tweets can be deleted by both, either the company or the users themselves.Why do we use X on our website?Like many other websites and companies, we try to use different channels for offering our services and communicating with our customers. X is a truly useful \u201csmall\u201d news service, which is why it has grown dear to us. We regularly tweet or retweet exciting, funny or interesting content. We understand that you do not have the time to follow every channel after channel, as you surely have enough other things to do. That is why we also have integrated X functions to our website. That way, you can experience our X activities \u201con site\u201d or come to our X page via a direct link. With the integration, we want to strengthen the service and user-friendliness on our website.What data is stored by X?You will find integrated X functions on some of our subpages. If you interact with X content, such as by clicking a button, X may collect and save data. This can happen even if you don\u2019t have a X account yourself. X calls this data \u201clog data\u201d. It includes demographic data, browser cookie IDs, your smartphone\u2019s ID, hashed email addresses, and information on which pages you have visited on X and what actions you have taken there. Of course, X stores more data if you have a X account and are logged in. This retention is usually done via cookies. Cookies are small text files that are usually set in your browser and transmit various information to X.We will now show you which cookies are placed if you are not logged in to X but visit a website with built-in X functions. Please consider this list as an example. We do not claim for this list to be extensive, since the array of cookies always changes and depends on your individual actions with X content.The following cookies have been used in our test:Name: personalization_idValue: \u201cv1_cSJIsogU51SeE122472826\u201dPurpose: This cookie stores information on how you use the website and what ad may have led you to X.Expiry date: after 2 yearsName: langValue: enPurpose: This cookie stores your default or preferred language.Expiry date: after end of sessionName: guest_idValue: 122472826v1%3A157132626Purpose: This cookie is set to identify you as a guest.Expiry date: after 2 yearsName: fmValue: 0Purpose: Unfortunately, we could not find out the purpose of this cookie.\u00a0Expiry date: after end of sessionName: external_refererValue: 1224728262beTA0sf5lkMrlGtPurpose: This cookie collects anonymous data, such as how often you visit X and how long you visit X.Expiry date: after 6 daysName: eu_cnValue: 1Purpose: This cookie stores user activity and is used for X\u2019s various advertising purposes.Expiry date: after one yearName: ct0Value: c1179f07163a365d2ed7aad84c99d966Purpose: Unfortunately we could not find any information on this cookie.Expiry date: after 6 hoursName: _twitter_sessValue: 53D%253D\u2013dd0248122472826-Purpose: With this cookie you can use functions within X\u2019s website.Expiry date: after end of sessionNote: X\u00a0also works with third parties. Therefore, we have recognized the three Google Analytics cookies _ga, _gat, _gid in our test.On the one hand, X uses the collected data for gaining better understand on user behaviour, and thus to improve their own services and advertising offers. On the other hand, the data are also used for internal security measures.How long and where are the data stored?When X collects data from other websites, after a maximum of 30 days, they will be deleted, summarised or otherwise concealed. X\u2019s servers are in various server centres in the United States. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the gathered data will be collected and stored in America. In our research we could not clearly determine whether X also owns servers in Europe. Generally, X may keep collected data stored until either the data are no longer useful to the company, until you delete the data or until a potential legal deletion period has been reached.How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?In their Privacy Policy, X repeatedly emphasise that they do not save data from external website visits, provided you or your browser are in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. However, if you interact directly with X, the company will of course store your data.If you have a X account, you can manage your data by clicking on \u201cMore\u201d under the \u201cProfile\u201d button. Then click on \u201cSettings and privacy\u201d. Here you can manage data processing individually.If you do not have a X account, you can go to twitter.com and click \u201cSettings\u201d. At \u201cPersonalisation and data\u201d you can manage data that is collected on you.As mentioned above, most data are stored via cookies, which you can manage, deactivate or delete in your browser. Please note that when changing cookie settings in your browser, the edits will only affect that very browser. This means that if you use another browser in the future, you will have to manage your cookie settings there again. In the following you will find instructions for managing cookies in the most popular browsers.Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in ChromeSafari: Manage cookies and website data in SafariFirefox: Clear cookies and site data in FirefoxInternet Explorer: Delete and manage cookiesMicrosoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft EdgeYou can also set your browser to notify you about each individual cookie. This lets you decide individually whether you want to allow or deny a cookie.X also uses the data for personalised advertising in-and outside of X. You can switch off personalised advertising in the settings under \u201cPersonalization and data\u201d. If you use X on a browser, you can deactivate personalised advertising at http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN.Legal basisIf you have consented processing and storage of your data by integrated social media elements, this consent is the legal basis for data processing (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) . Generally, your data is also stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) to maintain fast and good communication with you or other customers and business partners. We only use integrated social media elements if you have given your consent. Most social media platforms also place cookies in your browser to store data.

Thus, we want to draw more people\u2019s attention on the internet to the high quality of our offers. As part of our advertising measures with Google Ads, we use the conversion tracking of Google LLC., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\u201cGoogle\u201d) on our website. With the aid of this free tracking tool we can tailor our advertising offer better to your interests and needs. In the following article we will explain, why we use conversion tracking, what data gets saved and how you can prevent this data retention.Google Ads (previously Google AdWords) is the internal online advertising sxstem of the company Google LLC. We are convinced of our offer\u2018s quality and would like as many people as possible to discover our website. For this, Google Ads offers the best platform within the online environment. Of course, we also want to get an overview of the cost-benefit factor of our advertising campaigns. Thence, we use Google Ads\u2019 conversion tracking tool.But what is a conversion actually? A conversion occurs, when you turn from an interested visitor into an acting website visitor. This happens every time you click on our ad and then make another action, such as paying a visit to our website. With Google\u2019s conversion tracking tool, we can understand what happens after a user clicks our Google ad. It shows us for instance if products get bought, services are used or whether users have subscribed to our newsletter.Why do we use Google Ads conversion tracking on our website?We use Google Ads to show our offer also across other websites. Our aim is for our advertising campaigns to reach only those people, who are interested in our offers. With the conversion tracking tool, we see what keywords, ads, ad groups and campaigns lead to the desired customer actions. We see how many customers interact with our ads on a device, to then convert. With this data we can calculate our cost-benefit-factor, measure the success of individual ad campaigns and therefore optimise our online marketing measures. With the help of the obtained data we can give our website a more interesting design and customise our advertising offer better to your needs.What data is stored with Google Ads conversion tracking?For a better analysis of certain user actions, we have integrated a conversion tracking tag, or code snippet to our website.

Cookies are little text files that save information on your computer.Here are data of the most significant cookies for Google\u2019s conversion tracking:Name: ConversionValue: EhMI_aySuoyv4gIVled3Ch0llweVGAEgt-mr6aXd7dYlSAGQ122472826-3Purpose: This cookie saves every conversion you make on our website after you came to us via a Google ad.Expiry date: after 3 monthsName: _gacValue: 1.1558695989.EAIaIQobChMIiOmEgYO04gIVj5AYCh2CBAPrEAAYASAAEgIYQfD_BwEPurpose: This is a classic Google Analytics Cookie that records various actions on our website.Expiry date: after 3 monthsNote: The cookie _gac only appears in connection with Google Analytics.

It is an advertising program by Microsoft which is based on a Pay-Per-Click system. This means that advertisers can advertise through the search engines Bing and Yahoo! and only pay when a user clicks the ad.Why do we use Microsoft Advertising?We are convinced of our offers, and therefore, we of course want to show them to a wider public.

This helps to load our website quickly and easily, regardless of your location. Moreover, your personal data will also be stored, managed and processed on the respective CDN provider\u2019s servers. In the following, we will go into more general detail on this service and the data processing associated with it. You can find detailed information on how your data is handled in the provider\u2019s Privacy Policy.Each content delivery network (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers that are connected to each other via the internet. Through this network, website content (especially very large files) can be delivered quickly and smoothly, even when large loading peaks occur. To make this possible, CDNs create a copy of our website on their servers. The website can be delivered quickly because these servers are distributed all around the world. Any data transfer to your browser is therefore significantly shortened by the CDN.Why do we use a Content Delivery Network for our website?A fast loading website is part of our service. Of course, we know how annoying it is when a website loads at a snail\u2019s pace. Most of the time, you lose your patience and click away before the website is fully loaded. But of course we want to avoid that. Therefore, to us a fast loading website is an obligatory part of our website offer. With the use of a content delivery network, our website loads significantly faster in your browser. Furthermore, CDNs are particularly helpful when you are abroad, as the website is always delivered from a server in your area.Which data are processed?If you access a website or its content and it gets cached in a CDN, the CDN forwards the request to the server closest to you which then delivers the content. Content delivery networks are built in a way that JavaScript libraries can be downloaded and hosted on npm and Github servers. Alternatively, WordPress plugins can also be loaded on most CDNs, provided they are hosted on WordPress.org. Moreover, your browser can send personal data to the content delivery network we use. This includes data such as IP addresses, browser type, browser version, the accessed website or the time and date of the page visit. This data is collected and stored by the CDN. Whether cookies are used for data storage depends on the network that is being used. For more information on this, please read the Privacy Policy of the respective service.Right to objectIf you want to prevent this data transfer altogether, you can use a JavaScript blocker (see for example https://noscript.net/) on your computer. However, our website can then of course no longer offer its usual service (such as a fast loading speeds).Legal basisIf you have consented to the use of a content delivery network, your consent represents the the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. a (consent) your consent represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as it can occur when collected by a content delivery network.We also have a legitimate interest in using a content delivery network to optimise our online service and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests). Nevertheless, we only use the tool if you have consented to it.Provided this information is available, you can find out more about the particular content delivery networks in the following sections.Cloudflare Privacy PolicyCloudflare Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: service performance optimisation (to accelerate website loading times)\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: data such as IP address, contact and protocol information, security fingerprints and website performance dataYou can find more details on this in the Privacy Policy below.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: most of the data is stored for less than 24 hours\u2696\ufe0f Legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What is Cloudflare?We use Cloudflare by the company Cloudflare, Inc. (101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) on our website to enhance its speed and security. For this, Cloudflare uses cookies and processes user data. Cloudflare, Inc. is an American company that offers a content delivery network and various security services. These services take place between the user and our hosting provider. In the following, we will try to explain in detail what all this means.A content delivery network (CDN), as provided by Cloudflare, is nothing more than a network of servers that are connected to each other. Cloudflare has deployed servers around the world, which ensure websites can appear on your screen faster. Simply put, Cloudflare makes copies of our website and places them on its own servers. Thus, when you visit our website, a load distribution system ensures that the main part of our website is delivered by a server that can display our website to you as quickly as possible. The CDN significantly shortens the route of the transmitted data to your browser. Thus, Cloudflare does not only deliver our website\u2019s content from our hosting server, but from servers from all over the world. Cloudflare is particularly helpful for users from abroad, since pages can be delivered from a nearby server. In addition to the fast delivery of websites, Cloudflare also offers various security services, such as DDoS protection, or the web application firewall.Why do we use Cloudflare on our website?Of course, we want our website to offer you the best possible service. Cloudflare helps us make our website faster and more secure. Cloudflare offers us web optimisations as well as security services such as DDoS protection and a web firewall. Moreover, this includes a Reverse-Proxy and the content distribution network (CDN). Cloudflare blocks threats and limits abusive bots as well as crawlers that waste our bandwidth and server resources. By storing our website in local data centres and blocking spam software, Cloudflare enables us to reduce our bandwidth usage by about 60%. Furthermore, the provision of content through a data centre near you and certain web optimizations carried out there, cut the average loading time of a website in about half. According to Cloudflare, the setting \u201cI\u2019m Under Attack Mode\u201d can be used to mitigate further attacks by displaying a JavaScript calculation task that must be solved before a user can access a website. Overall, this makes our website significantly more powerful and less susceptible to spam or other attacks.What data is stored by Cloudflare?Cloudflare generally only transmits data that is controlled by website operators. Therefore, Cloudflare does not determine the content, but the website operator themselves does. Additionally, Cloudflare may collect certain information about the use of our website and may process data we send or data which Cloudflare has received certain instructions for. Mostly, Cloudflare receives data such as IP addresses, contacts and protocol information, security fingerprints and websites\u2019 performance data. Log data for example helps Cloudflare identify new threats. That way, Cloudflare can ensure a high level of security for our website. As part of their services, Cloudflare process this data in compliance with the applicable laws. Of course, this also includes the compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Furthermore, Cloudflare uses a cookie for security reasons. The cookie (__cfduid) is used to identify individual users behind a shared IP address, and to apply security settings for each individual user. The cookie is very useful, if you e.g. use our website from a restaurant where several infected computers are located. However, if your computer is trustworthy, we can recognise that with the cookie. Hence, you will be able to freely and carelessly surf our website, despite the infected PCs in your area. Another point that is important to know, is that this cookie does not store any personal data. The cookie is essential for Cloudflare\u2019s security functions and cannot be deactivated.Cookies by CloudflareName: __cfduidValue: d798bf7df9c1ad5b7583eda5cc5e78122472826-3Purpose: Security settings for each individual visitorExpiry date: after one yearCloudflare also works with third party providers. They may however only process personal data after the instruction of Cloudflare and in accordance with the data protection guidelines and other confidentiality and security measures. Without explicit consent from us, Cloudflare will not pass on any personal data.How long and where is the data stored?Cloudflare stores your information primarily in the United States and the European Economic Area. Cloudflare can transfer and access the information described above, from all over the world. In general, Cloudflare stores domains\u2019 user-level data with the Free, Pro and Business versions for less than 24 hours. For enterprise domains that have activated Cloudflare Logs (previously called Enterprise LogShare or ELS), data can be stored for up to 7 days. However, if IP addresses trigger security warnings in Cloudflare, there may be exceptions to the storage period mentioned above.How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?Cloudflare only keeps data logs for as long as necessary and in most cases deletes the data within 24 hours. Cloudflare also does not store any personal data, such as your IP address. However, there is information that Cloudflare store indefinitely as part of their permanent logs. This is done to improve the overall performance of Cloudflare Resolver and to identify potential security risks. You can find out exactly which permanent logs are saved at https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/. All data Cloudflare collects (temporarily or permanently) is cleared of all personal data. Cloudflare also anonymise all permanent logs.In their privacy policy, Cloudflare state that they are not responsible for the content you receive. For example, if you ask Cloudflare whether you can update or delete content, Cloudflare will always refer to us as the website operator. You can also completely prevent the collection and processing of your data by Cloudflare, when you deactivate the execution of script-code in your browser, or if you integrate a script blocker to your browser.Legal basisIf you have consented to the use of Cloudflare, your consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. a (Consent) your consent is the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as can occur when it is collected by Cloudflare.We also have a legitimate interest in using Cloudflare to optimise our online service and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit.f GDPR (legitimate interests). Nevertheless, we only use Cloudflare if you have given your consent to it.Cloudflare processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. Cloudflare is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA.

Spam includes advertising emails from mass mailings that you did not sign up for yourself. Such emails are also called data garbage and can also cause costs. Other spam such as phishing emails, on the other hand, are messages that aim to gain trust via fake messages or websites in order to obtain personal information. Anti-spam software usually protects against unwanted spam messages or malicious emails that could inject viruses into our system. We also use general firewall and security systems that protect our devices from unwanted network attacks.Why do we use Security & Anti-spam software?We put great importance on our website\u2019s security. After all, this is not just about our safety, but also about your safety. Unfortunately, cyber threats are now part of everyday life in the world of IT and the internet. Hackers e. g. often try to steal personal data from IT systems with the help of cyber attacks. And therefore a good defence system is absolutely necessary. A security system monitors all incoming and outgoing connections to our network or computer. In order to achieve even greater security against cyber attacks, we also use other external security services on our devices in addition to standardised security systems. Unauthorised data transmissions are thus better prevented and this is how we protect ourselves from cybercrime.Which data are processed by Security & Anti-spam software?The data that is collected and stored of course depends on the respective service. However, we always try to only use programs that collect data very sparingly or only store data that is necessary for the fulfilment of the offered service. In general, the service may store data such as name, address, IP address, email address and technical data such as browser type or browser version. Any performance and log data may also be collected in order to identify possible incoming threats in good time. This data will be processed as part of the provided services and in compliance with applicable laws. This also includes the GDPR for US providers (via the Standard Contractual Clauses). In some cases, security services also work with third parties who may store and/or process data under instructions and in accordance with privacy policies and other security measures. Data is usually stored using cookies.Duration of data processingWe will inform you below about the duration of data processing, provided we have further information on this. For example, security programs store data until you or we revoke data storage. In general, personal data is only stored for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of the services. Unfortunately, in many cases, we do not have precise information from the providers about their data storage periods.Right to objectYou also have the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party security software at any time. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing the cookies in your browser.Since cookies may also be used with security services, we recommend you read our privacy policy on cookies. To find out exactly which of your data is stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies of the respective tools.Legal BasisWe use security services mainly on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in a good security system and protection against various cyber attacks.Certain data processing requires your consent \u2013 in particular, the use of cookies and security functions. If you have agreed to the processing and storage of your data by integrated security services, your consent is the legal basis for data processing (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Most of the services we use set cookies on your browser to store data. We, therefore, recommend you read our privacy policy on cookies carefully and consult the privacy policy or cookie policy of the relevant service provider.Information on special tools \u2013 if available \u2013 can be found in the following sections.Google reCAPTCHA Privacy PolicyGoogle reCAPTCHA Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: Service optimisation and protection against cyber attacks\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: data such as IP address, browser information, operating system, limited location and usage dataYou can find more details on this in the Privacy Policy below.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: depending on the retained data\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What is reCAPTCHA?Our primary goal is to provide you an experience on our website that is as secure and protected as possible. To do this, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With reCAPTCHA we can determine whether you are a real person from flesh and bones, and not a robot or a spam software. By spam we mean any electronically undesirable information we receive involuntarily. Classic CAPTCHAS usually needed you to solve text or picture puzzles to check. But thanks to Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA you usually do have to do such puzzles. Most of the times it is enough to simply tick a box and confirm you are not a bot. With the new Invisible reCAPTCHA version you don\u2019t even have to tick a box. In this privacy policy you will find out how exactly this works, and what data is used for it.reCAPTCHA is a free captcha service from Google that protects websites from spam software and misuse by non-human visitors. This service is used the most when you fill out forms on the Internet. A captcha service is a type of automatic Turing-test that is designed to ensure specific actions on the Internet are done by human beings and not bots. During the classic Turing-test (named after computer scientist Alan Turing), a person differentiates between bot and human. With Captchas, a computer or software program does the same. Classic captchas function with small tasks that are easy to solve for humans but provide considerable difficulties to machines. With reCAPTCHA, you no longer must actively solve puzzles. The tool uses modern risk techniques to distinguish people from bots. The only thing you must do there, is to tick the text field \u201cI am not a robot\u201d. However, with Invisible reCAPTCHA even that is no longer necessary. reCAPTCHA, integrates a JavaScript element into the source text, after which the tool then runs in the background and analyses your user behaviour. The software calculates a so-called captcha score from your user actions. Google uses this score to calculate the likelihood of you being a human, before entering the captcha. reCAPTCHA and Captchas in general are used every time bots could manipulate or misuse certain actions (such as registrations, surveys, etc.).Why do we use reCAPTCHA on our website?We only want to welcome people from flesh and bones on our side and want bots or spam software of all kinds to stay away. Therefore, we are doing everything we can to stay protected and to offer you the highest possible user friendliness. For this reason, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google. Thus, we can be pretty sure that we will remain a \u201cbot-free\u201d website. Using reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google to determine whether you genuinely are human. reCAPTCHA thus ensures our website\u2019s and subsequently your security. Without reCAPTCHA it could e.g. happen that a bot would register as many email addresses as possible when registering, in order to subsequently \u201cspam\u201d forums or blogs with unwanted advertising content. With reCAPTCHA we can avoid such bot attacks.What data is stored by reCAPTCHA?reCAPTCHA collects personal user data to determine whether the actions on our website are made by people. Thus, IP addresses and other data Google needs for its reCAPTCHA service, may be sent to Google. Within member states of the European Economic Area, IP addresses are almost always compressed before the data makes its way to a server in the USA. Moreover, your IP address will not be combined with any other of Google\u2019s data, unless you are logged into your Google account while using reCAPTCHA. Firstly, the reCAPTCHA algorithm checks whether Google cookies from other Google services (YouTube, Gmail, etc.) have already been placed in your browser. Then reCAPTCHA sets an additional cookie in your browser and takes a snapshot of your browser window.The following list of collected browser and user data is not exhaustive. Rather, it provides examples of data, which to our knowledge, is processed by Google.Referrer URL (the address of the page the visitor has come from)IP-address (z.B. 256.123.123.1)Information on the operating system (the software that enables the operation of your computers. Popular operating systems are Windows, Mac OS X or Linux)Cookies (small text files that save data in your browser)Mouse and keyboard behaviour (every action you take with your mouse or keyboard is stored)Date and language settings (the language and date you have set on your PC is saved)All Javascript objects (JavaScript is a programming language that allows websites to adapt to the user. JavaScript objects can collect all kinds of data under one name)Screen resolution (shows how many pixels the image display consists of)Google may use and analyse this data even before you click on the \u201cI am not a robot\u201d checkmark. In the Invisible reCAPTCHA version, there is no need to even tick at all, as the entire recognition process runs in the background. Moreover, Google have not given details on what information and how much data they retain.The following cookies are used by reCAPTCHA: With the following list we are referring to Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA demo version at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo.For tracking purposes, all these cookies require a unique identifier. Here is a list of cookies that Google reCAPTCHA has set in the demo version:Name: IDEValue: WqTUmlnmv_qXyi_DGNPLESKnRNrpgXoy1K-pAZtAkMbHI-122472826-8Purpose: This cookie is set by DoubleClick (which is owned by Google) to register and report a user\u2019s interactions with advertisements. With it, ad effectiveness can be measured, and appropriate optimisation measures can be taken. IDE is stored in browsers under the domain doubleclick.net.Expiry date: after one yearName: 1P_JARValue: 2019-5-14-12Purpose: This cookie collects website usage statistics and measures conversions. A conversion e.g. takes place, when a user becomes a buyer. The cookie is also used to display relevant adverts to users. Furthermore, the cookie can prevent a user from seeing the same ad more than once.Expiry date: after one monthName: ANIDValue: U7j1v3dZa1224728260xgZFmiqWppRWKOrPurpose: We could not find out much about this cookie. In Google\u2019s privacy statement, the cookie is mentioned in connection with \u201cadvertising cookies\u201d such as \u201cDSID\u201d, \u201cFLC\u201d, \u201cAID\u201d and \u201cTAID\u201d. ANID is stored under the domain google.com.Expiry date: after 9 monthsName: CONSENTValue: YES+AT.de+20150628-20-0Purpose: This cookie stores the status of a user\u2019s consent to the use of various Google services. CONSENT also serves to prevent fraudulent logins and to protect user data from unauthorised attacks.Expiry date: after 19 yearsName: NIDValue: 0WmuWqy122472826zILzqV_nmt3sDXwPeM5QPurpose: Google uses NID to customise advertisements to your Google searches. With the help of cookies, Google \u201cremembers\u201d your most frequently entered search queries or your previous ad interactions. Thus, you always receive advertisements tailored to you. The cookie contains a unique ID to collect users\u2019 personal settings for advertising purposes.Expiry date: after 6 monthsName: DVValue: gEAABBCjJMXcI0dSAAAANbqc122472826-4Purpose: This cookie is set when you tick the \u201cI am not a robot\u201d checkmark. Google Analytics uses the cookie personalised advertising. DV collects anonymous information and is also used to distinct between users.Expiry date: after 10 minutesNote: We do not claim for this list to be extensive, as Google often change the choice of their cookies.How long and where are the data stored?Due to the integration of reCAPTCHA, your data will be transferred to the Google server. Google have not disclosed where exactly this data is stored, despite repeated inquiries. But even without confirmation from Google, it can be assumed that data such as mouse interaction, length of stay on a website or language settings are stored on the European or American Google servers. The IP address that your browser transmits to Google does generally not get merged with other Google data from the company\u2019s other services.However, the data will be merged if you are logged in to your Google account while using the reCAPTCHA plug-in. Google\u2019s diverging privacy policy applies for this.How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?If you want to prevent any data about you and your behaviour to be transmitted to Google, you must fully log out of Google and delete all Google cookies before visiting our website or use the reCAPTCHA software. Generally, the data is automatically sent to Google as soon as you visit our website. To delete this data, you must contact Google Support at https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&tid=122472826.If you use our website, you agree that Google LLC and its representatives automatically collect, edit and use data.Please note that when using this tool, your data can also be stored and processed outside the EU. Most third countries (including the USA) are not considered secure under current European data protection law. Data to insecure third countries must not simply be transferred to, stored and processed there unless there are suitable guarantees (such as EU\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses) between us and the non-European service provider.Legal basisIf you have consented to the use of Google reCAPTCHA, your consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent) your consent is the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as can occur when processed by Google reCAPTCHA.We also have a legitimate interest in using Google reCAPTCHA to optimise our online service and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests). Nevertheless, we only use Google reCAPTCHA if you have given your consent to it.Google processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. Google is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. More information can be found at https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en.Additionally, Google uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (Article 46(2) and (3) GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, Google commits to maintaining the European data protection level when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding Standard Contractual Clauses here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847.You can find the Google Ads Data Processing Terms, which refer to the Standard Contractual Clauses, at: https://business.safety.google/intl/en/adsprocessorterms/You can find out a little more about reCAPTCHA on Google\u2019s web developer page at https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/. Google goes into the technical development of the reCAPTCHA in more detail here, but you will look in vain for detailed information about data storage and data protection issues. A good overview of the basic use of data by Google can be found in the in-house data protection declaration at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB.Cloud ServicesCloud Services Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: We as the website operator and you as the website visitor\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: security and data storage\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: Data such as your IP address, name or technical data such as your browser versionMore details can be found below and in the individual privacy policies or in the privacy policies of the providers\ud83d\udcc5 Duration of storage: In most cases, data is stored until it is no longer required in order to provide the service\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What are cloud services?As a website operator, cloud services provide us with storage space and computing power via the internet. Data can be transmitted to an external system, where it may be processed and stored via the internet. The relevant cloud provider manages this data. Depending on specific requirements, an individual or a company can choose storage space or computing power. Cloud storage is accessed via an API or via storage protocols. API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a programming interface that connects software with hardware components.Why do we use cloud services?We use cloud services for several reasons. A cloud service offers us the opportunity to store our data securely. In addition, we can access the data from different locations and devices, giving us more flexibility and simplifying our work processes. Cloud storage also saves us costs because we don\u2019t have to set up and manage our own infrastructure for data storage and data security. By storing our data centrally in the cloud, we can also expand our application fields and manage our information much better.As website operator or company, we use cloud services primarily for our own purposes. We e. g. manage our calendar and store documents or other important information in the cloud. However, your personal data may also be stored. This can take place if you provide us with your contact details (e.g. name and email address) while we store our customer data with a cloud provider. Consequently, any of your data we process may also be stored and processed on external servers. Provided we offer certain forms of content by cloud services on our website, cookies can also be set for web analysis and advertising purposes. Furthermore, such cookies retain your settings (e.g. the language used) so you will be provided with your usual web environment next time you visit our website.Which data is processed by cloud services?Much of the data we store in the cloud cannot be used to identify you as a person, but some data is personal data as defined by the GDPR. This is often customer data such as name, address, IP address or telephone number or technical device information. Videos, images and audio files may also be stored in the cloud. Exactly how the data is collected and stored depends on the respective service. We only try to use services that handle your data in a very reliable and professional manner. Generally, services such as Amazon Drive, have access to the stored files in order to be able to offer their own service accordingly. For this, however, the services require consent (such as for the right to copy files for security reasons). The data will be processed and handled as part of the provided services and in compliance with applicable laws. This also includes compliance with the GDPR for US providers (via the standard contractual clauses). In some cases, cloud services also cooperate with third parties who may process data under instructions and in accordance with privacy policies and other security measures. At this point we would like to emphasise again that all well-known cloud services (such as Amazon Drive, Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive) obtain the right to access stored content in order to be able to offer and optimise their own services accordingly.Duration of data processingWe will inform you below about the duration of data processing, provided we have further information on this. In general, cloud services store data until you or we revoke the data storage or erase the retained data. In general, personal data is only stored for as long as it is necessary for the provision of the respective services. However, it may take up to several months to erase your data from the cloud. This may occur because data is usually not only stored on one server but divided between different servers.Right to objectYou also have the right and the opportunity to revoke your consent to data storage in a cloud at any time. If cookies are used, you also have a right to withdraw your consent. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing the cookies in your browser. We also recommend you read our general privacy policy on cookies. To find out exactly which of your data is stored and processed, you should read the privacy policy of the respective cloud provider.Legal BasisWe use cloud services mainly on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in good security and storage systems.Certain types of processing, in particular the use of cookies and storage functions, require your consent. If you have consented to your data being processed and stored by cloud services, this consent is the legal basis for data processing (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Most of the services we use place cookies in your browser to store data. Thus, we recommend you read our privacy policy on cookies carefully and study the privacy policy or cookie policy of the relevant service provider.Information on special tools \u2013 if available \u2013 can be found in the following sections.Microsoft Azure Cloud Privacy PolicyWe also use the cloud service Microsoft Azure Cloud for our website. The provider of this service is the American company Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.Microsoft processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. Microsoft is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. More information can be found at https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en.Additionally, Microsoft uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (Article 46(2) and (3) GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA).

Therefore, you can watch videos or listen to music/podcasts directly via our website. This content is delivered by service providers and is obtained from the respective providers\u2019 servers.Audio and video elements are integrated functional elements of platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo or Spotify. It is usually free of charge to use these portals, but they can also contain paid content. With the integrated elements, you can listen to or view any of their content on our website.If you use audio or video elements on our website, your personal data may get transmitted to as well as processed and retained by service providers.Why do we use audio & video elements on our website?We of course want to provide you with the best offer on our website. And we are aware that content is no longer just conveyed in text and static images. Instead of just giving you a link to a video, we offer you audio and video formats directly on our website. These are entertaining or informative, but ideally they are both. Our service therefore gets expanded and it gets easier for you to access interesting content. In addition to our texts and images, we thus also offer video and/or audio content.Which data are retained by audio & video elements?When you visit a page on our website with e.g. an embedded video, your server connects to the service provider\u2019s server. Thus, your data will also be transferred to the third-party provider, where it will be stored. Certain data is collected and stored regardless of whether you have an account with the third party provider or not. This usually includes your IP address, browser type, operating system and other general information about your device. Most providers also collect information on your web activity. This e.g. includes the session duration, bounce rate, the buttons you clicked or information about the website you are using the service on. This data is mostly stored via cookies or pixel tags (also known as web beacons). Any data that is pseudonymised usually gets stored in your browser via cookies. In the respective provider\u2019s Privacy Policy, you can always find more information on the data that is stored and processed.Duration of data processingYou can find out exactly how long the data is stored on the third-party provider\u2019s servers either in a lower point of the respective tool\u2019s Privacy Policy or in the provider\u2019s Privacy Policy. Generally, personal data is only processed for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services or products. This usually also applies to third-party providers. In most cases, you can assume that certain data will be stored on third-party providers\u2019 servers for several years. Data can be retained for different amounts of time, especially when stored in cookies. Some cookies are deleted after you leave a website, while others may be stored in your browser for a few years.Right to objectYou also retain the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. You can e.g. also prevent data retention via cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing cookies in your browser. The legality of the processing up to the point of revocation remains unaffected.Since the integrated audio and video functions on our site usually also use cookies, we recommend you to also read our general Privacy Policy on cookies. You can find out more about the handling and storage of your data in the Privacy Policies of the respective third party providers.Legal basisIf you have consented to the processing and storage of your data by integrated audio and video elements, your consent is considered the legal basis for data processing (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). Generally, your data is also stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in maintaining fast and good communication with you or other customers and business partners. We only use the integrated audio and video elements if you have consented to it.YouTube Privacy PolicyYouTube Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: optimising our service\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: Data such as contact details, data on user behaviour, information about your device and IP address may be stored.You can find more details on this in the privacy policy below.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage period: data are generally stored for as long as is necessary for the purpose of the service\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What is YouTube?We have integrated YouTube videos to our website. Therefore, we can show you interesting videos directly on our site. YouTube is a video portal, which has been a subsidiary company of Google LLC since 2006. The video portal is operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. When you visit a page on our website that contains an embedded YouTube video, your browser automatically connects to the servers of YouTube or Google. Thereby, certain data are transferred (depending on the settings). Google is responsible for YouTube\u2019s data processing and therefore Google\u2019s data protection applies.In the following we will explain in more detail which data is processed, why we have integrated YouTube videos and how you can manage or clear your data.On YouTube, users can watch, rate, comment or upload videos for free. Over the past few years, YouTube has become one of the most important social media channels worldwide. For us to be able to display videos on our website, YouTube provides a code snippet that we have integrated to our website.Why do we use YouTube videos on our website?YouTube is the video platform with the most visitors and best content. We strive to offer you the best possible user experience on our website, which of course includes interesting videos. With the help of our embedded videos, we can provide you other helpful content in addition to our texts and images. Additionally, embedded videos make it easier for our website to be found on the Google search engine. Moreover, if we place ads via Google Ads, Google only shows these ads to people who are interested in our offers, thanks to the collected data.What data is stored by YouTube?As soon as you visit one of our pages with an integrated YouTube, YouTube places at least one cookie that stores your IP address and our URL. If you are logged into your YouTube account, by using cookies YouTube can usually associate your interactions on our website with your profile. This includes data such as session duration, bounce rate, approximate location, technical information such as browser type, screen resolution or your Internet provider. Additional data can include contact details, potential ratings, shared content via social media or YouTube videos you added to your favourites.If you are not logged in to a Google or YouTube account, Google stores data with a unique identifier linked to your device, browser or app. Thereby, e.g. your preferred language setting is maintained. However, many interaction data cannot be saved since less cookies are set.In the following list we show you cookies that were placed in the browser during a test. On the one hand, we show cookies that were set without being logged into a YouTube account. On the other hand, we show you what cookies were placed while being logged in. We do not claim for this list to be exhaustive, as user data always depend on how you interact with YouTube.Name: YSCValue: b9-CV6ojI5Y122472826-1Purpose: This cookie registers a unique ID to store statistics of the video that was viewed.Expiry date: after end of sessionName: PREFValue: f1=50000000Purpose: This cookie also registers your unique ID.

Most of these servers are in America. At https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=en you can see where Google\u2019s data centres are located. Your data is distributed across the servers. Therefore, the data can be retrieved quicker and is better protected against manipulation.Google stores collected data for different periods of time. You can delete some data anytime, while other data are automatically deleted after a certain time, and still other data are stored by Google for a long time. Some data (such as elements on \u201cMy activity\u201d, photos, documents or products) that are saved in your Google account are stored until you delete them. Moreover, you can delete some data associated with your device, browser, or app, even if you are not signed into a Google Account.How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?Generally, you can delete data manually in your Google account. Furthermore, in 2019 an automatic deletion of location and activity data was introduced. Depending on what you decide on, it deletes stored information either after 3 or 18 months.Regardless of whether you have a Google account or not, you can set your browser to delete or deactivate cookies placed by Google. These settings vary depending on the browser you use. The following instructions will show how to manage cookies in your browser:Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in ChromeSafari: Manage cookies and website data in SafariFirefox: Clear cookies and site data in FirefoxInternet Explorer: Delete and manage cookiesMicrosoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft EdgeIf you generally do not want to allow any cookies, you can set your browser to always notify you when a cookie is about to be set. This will enable you to decide to either allow or permit each individual cookie.Legal basisIf you have consented processing and storage of your data by integrated YouTube elements, this consent is the legal basis for data processing (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). Generally, your data is also stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) to maintain fast and good communication with you or other customers and business partners. Nevertheless, we only use integrated YouTube elements if you have given your consent. YouTube also sets cookies in your browser to store data. We therefore recommend you to read our privacy policy on cookies carefully and to take a look at the privacy policy or the cookie policy of the respective service provider.Google processes data from you, among other things, in the USA.

Usually, data such as IP address, technical data, language settings, browser version, screen resolution and browser name are processed. You can find more details directly with the respective web design tools.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: depends on the tools used\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What is web design?We use various tools on our website for the purpose of our web design. Contrary to common belief, web design is not just about making our website look nice, but rather also about functionality and performance. But of course, a good-looking website is also a major goal of professional web design. Web design is a part of media design and deals with the visual as well as the structural and functional design of a website. Our aim with our web design is to improve your experience on our site. In web design jargon, this is called User Experience (UX) and usability. User Experience entails all impressions and experiences that website visitors come across on a website. What is more, usability is part of the User Experience, as it determines how user-friendly a website is. This includes the clear structuring of content, subpages or products, along with how quickly and easily the website enables you to find what you are looking for. In order to offer you the best possible experience on our website, we also use so-called third-party web design tools. Therefore, all tools and services that help improve our website\u2019s design are classified under the category \u201cweb design\u201d.\u00a0This may, for example, include fonts, various plugins or other integrated web design functions.Why do we use web design tools?The way you absorb information on a website depends very much on its structure, functionality and visual perception. Therefore, good and professional web design has become increasingly important for us. We are constantly working on improving our site as a way of further extending our services for you as a website visitor. Furthermore, a beautiful and functioning website also has economic advantages for us. Needless to say, you will only visit it and take advantage of our offers if you feel completely at ease.What data is stored by web design tools?When you visit our website, any web design elements integrated into our pages may process your data. The exact data that is processed depends on the tools used. Below you can see exactly which tools we use for our website. For more information about data processing, we recommend you also read the respective privacy policy of the respective tools. There you can usually find out which data is processed, whether cookies are used and how long the data is stored. Moreover, fonts such as Google Fonts, for example, also automatically transmit information such as your language settings, IP address, browser version, browser screen resolution and browser name to Google\u2019s servers.Duration of data processingData processing times are very individual and depend on the web design elements used. For example, when cookies are used, the retention period can be as little as a minute, but it may also be a few years. Please make yourself familiar with this topic. You may for example read our general section on cookies as well as the Privacy Policies of the tools used. There you can likely find out exactly which cookies are used and what information is stored there. For example, Google Font files are stored for one year, in order to improve the loading speed of a website. In principle, data is only kept for as long as is necessary to provide the service. But legal requirements may require data to be stored for longer.Right to objectYou also retain the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. You can do this either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. You can also prevent cookies from collecting your data by managing, deactivating or deleting the cookies in your browser. However, among web design elements (typically fonts) there is also data that cannot be erased easily. This is the case whenever data is automatically collected as soon as a page is accessed and then directly transmitted to a third party (e.g. Google). In these cases, please contact the support of the respective provider. In the case of Google, you can reach support at https://support.google.com/?hl=de.Legal BasisIf you have consented to the use of web design tools, this consent serves as the legal basis for the relevant data processing. According to Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR (consent), your consent represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as it may occur when it is collected by web design tools. We also have a legitimate interest in web design to improve on our website. After all, only then can we provide you with a beautiful and professional web offer. The corresponding legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we strongly want to emphasise once more that we only use web design tools if you have given your consent.You can find information on different web design tools \u2013 if available \u2013 in the following sections.Google Fonts Privacy PolicyGoogle Fonts Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: service optimisation\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: data such as IP address, CSS and font requestsYou can find more details on this in the Privacy Policy below.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage period: Google stores font files for one year\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What are Google Fonts?On our website we use Google Fonts, by the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).To use Google Fonts, you must log in and set up a password. Furthermore, no cookies will be saved in your browser. The data (CSS, Fonts) will be requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, all requests for CSS and fonts are fully separated from any other Google services. If you have a Google account, you do not need to worry that your Google account details are transmitted to Google while you use Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as well as the utilised fonts and stores these data securely. We will have a detailed look at how exactly the data storage works.Google Fonts (previously Google Web Fonts) is a directory with over 800 fonts that Google provides its users free of charge.Many of these fonts have been published under the SIL Open Font License license, while others have been published under the Apache license. Both are free software licenses.Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?With Google Fonts we can use different fonts on our website and do not have to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is an important element which helps to keep the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are automatically optimised for the web, which saves data volume and is an advantage especially for the use of mobile terminal devices. When you use our website, the low data size provides fast loading times. Moreover, Google Fonts are secure Web Fonts. Various image synthesis systems (rendering) can lead to errors in different browsers, operating systems and mobile terminal devices. These errors could optically distort parts of texts or entire websites. Due to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) there are no cross-platform issues with Google Fonts. All common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) are supported by Google Fonts, and it reliably operates on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We also use Google Fonts for presenting our entire online service as pleasantly and as uniformly as possible.Which data is stored by Google?Whenever you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded by a Google server. Through this external cue, data gets transferred to Google\u2019s servers. Therefore, this makes Google recognise that you (or your IP-address) is visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was developed to reduce the usage, storage and gathering of end user data to the minimum needed for the proper depiction of fonts. What is more, API stands for \u201eApplication Programming Interface\u201c and works as a software data intermediary.Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests safely with Google, and therefore it is protected. Using its collected usage figures, Google can determine how popular the individual fonts are. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Moreover, Google also utilises data of ist own web crawler, in order to determine which websites are using Google fonts. This data is published in Google Fonts\u2019 BigQuery database. Enterpreneurs and developers use Google\u2019s webservice BigQuery to be able to inspect and move big volumes of data.One more thing that should be considered, is that every request for Google Fonts automatically transmits information such as language preferences, IP address, browser version, as well as the browser\u2019s screen resolution and name to Google\u2019s servers. It cannot be clearly identified if this data is saved, as Google has not directly declared it.How long and where is the data stored?Google saves requests for CSS assets for one day in a tag on their servers, which are primarily located outside of the EU. This makes it possible for us to use the fonts by means of a Google stylesheet. With the help of a stylesheet, e.g. designs or fonts of a website can get changed swiftly and easily.Any font related data is stored with Google for one year. This is because Google\u2019s aim is to fundamentally boost websites\u2019 loading times. With millions of websites referring to the same fonts, they are buffered after the first visit and instantly reappear on any other websites that are visited thereafter. Sometimes Google updates font files to either reduce the data sizes, increase the language coverage or to improve the design.How can I erase my data or prevent it being stored?The data Google stores for either a day or a year cannot be deleted easily. Upon opening the page this data is automatically transmitted to Google. In order to clear the data ahead of time, you have to contact Google\u2019s support at https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&tid=122472826. The only way for you to prevent the retention of your data is by not visiting our website.Unlike other web fonts, Google offers us unrestricted access to all its fonts. Thus, we have a vast sea of font types at our disposal, which helps us to get the most out of our website. You can find out more answers and information on Google Fonts at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=122472826. While Google does address relevant elements on data protection at this link, it does not contain any detailed information on data retention.It proofs rather difficult to receive any precise information on stored data by Google.Legal basisIf you have consented to the use of Google Fonts, your consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (Consent) your consent is the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as can occur when it is processed by Google Fonts.We also have a legitimate interest in using Google Font to optimise our online service. The corresponding legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests). Nevertheless, we only use Google Font if you have given your consent to it.Google processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. Google is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. More information can be found at https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en.Additionally, Google uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (Article 46(2) and (3) GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, Google commits to maintaining the European data protection level when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding Standard Contractual Clauses here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847.You can find the Google Ads Data Processing Terms, which refer to the Standard Contractual Clauses, at: https://business.safety.google/intl/en/adsprocessorterms/You can find more information on which data is generally retained by Google and what this data is used at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB.Google Fonts Local Privacy PolicyOn our website we use Google Fonts, by the company Google Inc. The responsible entity for the European area is Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland). We have integrated Google fonts locally, i.e. on our web server and not on Google\u2019s servers. This means that no connection to Google\u2019s servers and therefore no data transfer or retention take place.What are Google Fonts?Google Fonts was previously called Google Web Fonts. It is an interactive list with over 800 fonts which Google offer for free use. With the use of Google Fonts, it is possible to utilise fonts without uploading them to your own server. In order to prevent any transfer of information to Google\u2019s servers, we downloaded the fonts to our own server. This way we can comply with data privacy and do not transmit any data to Google Fonts.Online Map Services IntroductionOnline Map Services Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: Improvement of user experience\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: the data that is processed depends heavily on the services used. Usually, it is your IP address, location data, search queries and/or technical data. You can find more details on this under the respective tools used.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: depends on the tools used\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What are Online Map Services?We also use online map services for our website as an extended service. Google Maps is probably the service you are most familiar with. But there are also other providers out there that specialise in creating digital maps. These services allow the display of locations, route maps or other geographical information directly via our website. Thanks to an integrated map service, you no longer have to leave our website to e. g. view the route to a location. In order to ensure that the online map can run on our website, we have integrated map sections within our HTML code. This way the services can display street maps, the earth\u2019s surface, or aerial or satellite imagery. If you use the built-in map service, your data will be transferred to the tool used, where it will be retained. This may also include your personal data.Why do we use Online Map Services on our website?Generally speaking, it is imperative for us to offer you a pleasant time on our website. Of course, we know that you will most likely only enjoy your time here if you can easily find your way around and find all the information you need quickly and easily. Therefore, we decided that an online map system may be a significant optimisation of our website\u2019s service. After all, you can use the map system to easily view route descriptions, locations or any other points of interest \u2013 without leaving our site. Needless to say, it is certainly also very practical that you can easily see where our company headquarters are so that you can find us quickly and safely. As you can see, there are just a lot of advantages \u2013 and we clearly consider online map services on our website to be part of our customer service.What data is stored by Online Map Services?If you open a page on our website with an online map function installed, your personal data may be transmitted to the relevant service, where it may be stored. This usually includes your IP address, which may also be used to determine your approximate location. In addition to your IP address, data such as the search terms you entered, as well as your longitude and latitude coordinates will be stored. If you e. g. enter an address for route planning, this data will also be stored. This data is not stored by us but instead on the servers of the integrated tools. You can think of it like this: You may be on our website, but when you interact with a mapping service, that interaction is actually happening on their website. Moreover, in order for the service to function properly, at least one cookie is usually set in your browser. As an example, Google Maps also uses cookies to record user behaviour, with which it can optimise its own service and offer personalised advertising. You can find out more about cookies in our \u201cCookies\u201d section.How long and where is the data stored?Every online map service processes different user data. Provided we have further information, we will inform you about the duration of data processing in the corresponding sections on the individual tools below. Generally, personal data is only retained for as long as is necessary to provide the service. Google Maps e. g. stores certain data for a specified period of time, but you must erase other data yourself. At Mapbox, for example, your IP address is stored for 30 days after which it is deleted. As you can see, each tool stores data for different lengths of time. We thus recommend you take a closer look at the privacy policies of the tools used.The providers may use cookies to store data on your user behaviour in relation to their map services. You can find more information about cookies in our \u201cCookies\u201d section, but in the individual providers\u2019 privacy policies you can most probably also find out which cookies may be used. In most cases, however, this is only an indicative list and is not exhaustive.Right to objectYou always have the possibility and the right to access your personal data and to object to its use and processing. You can also revoke the consent you gave to us at any time. This is usually easiest through the cookie consent tool. However, there are other opt-out tools that you can use. You can also manage, erase or deactivate any cookies set by the used providers yourself with just a few mouse clicks. However, this may lead to some service functions stopping to work as usual. It also depends on your browser how you can manage cookies there. In our \u201cCookies\u201d section you will find links to instructions of the most popular browsers.Legal BasisIf you have agreed to the use of an online map service, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing is this consent. According to Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. (consent) this consent is the legal basis for the processing of personal data as may occur when collected by an online map service.We also have a legitimate interest in using an online map service to optimise our service on our website. The corresponding legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use an online map service if you have given your consent. We definitely wanted to stress this point once again.You can find information on specific online map services \u2013 if available \u2013 in the following sections.Google Maps Privacy PolicyGoogle Maps Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: service optimisation\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: data such as entered search terms, IP address as well as latitude and longitude coordinates.You can find more details on this in the Privacy Policy below.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: depending on the retained data\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What is Google Maps?On our website we use Google Maps of the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With the use of Google Maps, we can show you locations in a better way and can therefore adjust our service to your needs. Due to the utilisation of Google Maps, data gets transferred to Google and is saved on Google\u2019s servers. In the following, we want to explain in detail what Google Maps is, why we use this Google service, what data is stored and how you can prevent this.Google Maps is an internet maps service of the company Google Inc. With Google Maps you can search for exact locations of cities, sights, accommodations or businesses online via a PC, a tablet or an app. If businesses are represented on Google My Business, the respective location as well as other information about the company are shown there. In order to show route directions, a location\u2019s map sections can be integrated in a website through a HTML-code. Google Maps depicts the earth\u2019s surface as either a road map or as air and satellite images. Due to the street view and high-quality satellite images, it is possible for exact representations to be made.Why do we use Google Maps on our website?The efforts we make on this page have the goal of giving you a useful and meaningful experience on our website. Through the integration of Google Maps, we can offer you essential information on various locations. Therefore, you can spot our office address with one glance. Furthermore, the route directions always show you the best and fastest way to us. You can retrieve the route directions for traveling either by car, by public transport, on foot or by bike. The integration of Google Maps is a part of our customer service.What data is stored by Google Maps?For Google Maps to offer its full services, the company must collect and store your data. This includes your entered search terms, your IP-address as well as your longitude and latitude coordinates. When you use the route-planner function, the entered start address is stored also. However, this data retention happens on Google Maps\u2018 websites. We can only inform you about it but cannot influence it in any way. Since we have included Google Maps on our website, Google will set at least one cookie (Name: NID) into your browser. This cookie saves data on your user behaviour. Google primarily uses this data to optimise ist own services and to provide you with individual, personalised advertisements.The following cookies are set in your browser due to the integration of Google Maps:Name: NIDValue: 188=h26c1Ktha7fCQTx8rXgLyATyITJ122472826-5Purpose: Google uses NID in order to adjust advertisments to your Google searches. With the cookie\u2019s help Google \u201cremembers\u201c your most frequently entered search queries or your previous interaction with ads. That way you always receive customised adertisments. The cookie contains a unique ID, wich Google uses to collect your personal settings for advertising porposes.Expiration date: after 6 monthsNote: We cannot guarantee completeness of the information on saved data. This is, because especially concerning the use of cookies, changes can happen anytime. To identify the cookie NID, a test page was created, to which Google Maps was included.How long and where is the data stored?There are Google servers in data centres across the entire planet. However, most servers are in America. For this reason, your data is widely stored in the USA. Here you can read in detail about where the Google servers are located: https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=enGoogle distributes data to various data carriers. This makes it possible to retrieve the data faster and to better protect it from possible attempted manipulations. Every server has emergency programs. Thus, should for example a problem with Google\u2019s hardware occur or should a natural disaster impact the servers, any data will quite certainly stay protected.Moreover, Google saves some data for a specified period. With some other data on the other hand, Google only offers the opportunity for deleting it manually. Furthermore, the company anonymises information (e.g. advertising data) in server logs, by deleting a part of the IP-address and cookie information after 9 to 18 months.How can I erase my data, or prevent data retention?Due to the automatic delete function for location and activity data, which was introduced in 2019, information that is used for determining your location and web or app activity is saved for either 3 or 18 months, depending on your preferred decision, and is deleted thereafter. Furthermore, it is possible to delete this data manually from your browser history via your Google account anytime. If you want to prevent the determination of your location altogether, you must pause the category \u201cWeb and app activity\u201d in your Google account. Click on \u201cData and personalisation\u201d and then choose the option \u201cActivity controls\u201d. Here you can switch the activities on or off.Moreover, in your browser you can deactivate, delete or manage individual cookies. This function can differ a little, depending on what browser you are using. The following instructions will show you how to manage cookies in your browser:Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in ChromeSafari: Manage cookies and website data in SafariFirefox: Clear cookies and site data in FirefoxInternet Explorer: Delete and manage cookiesMicrosoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft EdgeIf you generally do not want to permit any cookies, you can set up your browser in a way that ensures you get informed whenever a cookie is about to be placed. That way you can decide to either permit or refuse every single cookie.Please note, that when using this tool, your data may also be stored and processed outside the EU. Most third countries (including the USA) are not considered secure under current European data protection law. Data to insecure third countries must not simply be transferred to, stored and processed there unless there are suitable guarantees (such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses) between us and the non-European service provider.Legal basisIf you have consented to the use of Google Maps, your consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data processing. According to Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent) this consent is the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as can occur when processed by Google Maps.We also have a legitimate interest in using Google Maps to optimise our online service. The corresponding legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests). Nevertheless, we only use Google Maps if you have given your consent to it.Google processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. Google is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. More information can be found at https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en.Additionally, Google uses so-called Standard Contractual Clauses (Article 46(2) and (3) GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are template clauses provided by the EU Commission and are designed to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards, even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual Clauses, Google commits to maintaining the European data protection level when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding Standard Contractual Clauses here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847.The Google Ads Data Processing Terms, which reference the standard contractual clauses, can be found at https://business.safety.google/intl/en/adsprocessorterms/.If you want to find out more about Google\u2019s data processing, we recommend you to read the company\u2019s own Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB.Miscellaneous OverviewMiscellaneous Privacy Policy Overview\u00a0\ud83d\udc65 Affected parties: website visitors\ud83e\udd1d Purpose: Improvement of user experience\ud83d\udcd3 Processed data: The processed data depends heavily on the services used. Usually, it is an IP address and/or technical data. You can find more details on this in the sections of the respective tools.\ud83d\udcc5 Storage duration: depends on the tools used\u2696\ufe0f Legal bases: Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)What is included in \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d?The \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d category includes any services that do not fit into any of the above categories. Usually, they are various plugins and integrated elements that are meant to improve our website. Generally, these functions are obtained from third parties and integrated into our website. They may e.g. be web search services such as Algolia Place, Giphy, Programmable Search Engine or online services for weather data such as OpenWeather.Why do we use these third parties?With our website, we want to provide you with the best web offer in our industry. Websites have long been so much more than just a business card for companies. Instead, they are a place designed to help you find what you\u2019re looking for. And in order to make our website even more interesting and helpful for you, we use various third-party services.Which data is processed?Whenever elements are integrated into our website, your IP address will be transmitted to the respective provider, where it will be stored and processed. This is necessary to send the content to your browser which will then display it for you. Moreover, service providers may also use pixel tags or web beacons. These are small graphics on websites that can record a log file and create analyses of it. Providers can improve their own marketing measures with the information they receive this way. In addition to pixel tags, this information (e.g. which button you click or when you access which page) can also be stored in cookies. In addition to data analyses on your web behaviour, technical information such as your browser type or operating system may also be stored there. Some providers can also link the data they obtain to other internal services or to third-party providers. Each provider handles your data differently. Therefore, we recommend you carefully read the privacy policies of the respective services. We make every effort to only use services that operate very carefully in regards to data protection and privacy.Duration of data processingBelow we will inform you about the duration of data processing, provided we have further information on this. In general, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products.Legal BasisIf we ask for your consent and you agree to us using a service, this consent serves as the legal basis for the processing of your data (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). In addition to your consent, we have a legitimate interest in analysing the behaviour of our website visitors and thus technically and economically improving our offer. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use any tools if you have given your consent.Information on the special tools \u2013 if available \u2013 can be found in the following sections.Clarity Privacy PolicyOn our website we use Clarity, which is a project and portfolio tool. The service provider is the American company Broadcom Inc., 1320 Ridder Park Drive, San Jose, CA 95131, USA.Broadcom also processes data in the USA, among other countries. We would like to note, that according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA. This can be associated with various risks to the legality and security of data processing.Broadcom uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission as the basis for data processing by recipients based in third countries (i. e. outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and thus especially in the USA) or data transfer there (= Art. 46, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are legal templates provided by the EU Commission. Their purpose is to ensure that your data complies with European data privacy standards, even if your data is transferred to and stored in third countries (such as the USA). With these clauses, Broadcom commits to comply with the EU\u2018s level of data protection when processing relevant data, even if it is stored, processed and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing order by the EU Commission. You can find the order and the standard contractual clauses here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=enFor more information on Broadcom\u2019s standard contractual clauses, please see the data processing terms and conditions at https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/dpa-amendment-2021-standard-contractual-clauses.You can learn more about the data processed using Clarity in the privacy policy at https://www.broadcom.com/company/legal/privacy/policy.DocuSign Privacy PolicyWe use the transaction management platform DocuSign for our website. The service provider is the American company DocuSign, Inc., 221 Main Street Suite 1000 San Francisco, CA 94105, USA.DocuSign also processes data in the USA. We would like to point out that according to the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for the transfer of data to the USA. This may be associated with various risks to the legality and security of data processing.As a basis for data processing with recipients located in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, i.e. especially in the USA) or a data transfer there, DocuSign uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission (= Art. 46. para. 2 and 3 DSGVO). These clauses oblige DocuSign to comply with the EU level of data protection when processing relevant data also outside the EU. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the order and the clauses here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2847For more information on DocuSign\u00b4s standard contractual clauses, see https://www.docusign.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/schedule-docusign-gen-negotiate/attachment-data-protection/.You can learn more about the data processed using DocuSign in the privacy policy at https://www.docusign.com/privacy/.Data Processing Agreement (DPA) DocuSignIn accordance with Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we have entered into a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with DocuSign. What exactly a DPA is and especially what must be included in a DPA, you can read in our general section \u201cData Processing Agreement (DPA)\u201d.This contract is required by law because DocuSign processes personal data on our behalf. It clarifies that DocuSign may only process data they receive from us according to our instructions and must comply with the GDPR. You can find the link to the data processing agreement at https://www.docusign.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/schedule-docusign-signature/attachment-data-protection/.Explanation of the terminology usedWe always strive to make our privacy policy as clear and comprehensible as possible. However, this is not always easy, especially when it comes to technical and legal matters. It is often sensible to use legal terms (such as \u2018personal data)\u2019 or certain technical terms (such as \u2018cookies\u2019 or \u2018IP address\u2019). But we don\u2019t want to use such terms without any explanation. This is why you will find an alphabetical list of important terms used below. These are terms we may not yet have sufficiently explained in the privacy policy. In case we have adopted any of these terms from the GDPR which are definitions, we will also list the GDPR texts here and add our own further explanations if necessary.ProcessorDefinition according to Article 4 of the GDPRFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:\u201cprocessor\u201d means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;Explanation: As a company and a website owner, we are responsible for all your data we process (i. e. the \u2018controller\u2019). In addition to the controller, there may also be so-called processors. This includes any company or person who processes personal data on our behalf. In addition to service providers such as tax consultants, processors can also be hosting or cloud providers, payment or newsletter providers or large companies such as Google or Microsoft.ConsentDefinition according to Article 4 of the GDPRFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:\u201cconsent\u201d\u00a0of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her;Explanation: With websites, such consent is usually given via a cookie consent tool. You\u2019ve most certainly come across these. Whenever you visit a website for the first time, you will usually be asked via a banner whether you agree or consent to the data processing. You can usually also make individual settings and thus decide for yourself which level of data processing you want to allow. If you do not give your consent, no personal data may be processed. Consent can of course also be given in writing, i.e. not via a tool.Personal DataDefinition according to Article 4 of the GDPRFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:\u201cpersonenal data\u201d means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data subject\u2019); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;Explanation: Personal data is all data that can identify you as a person. This is usually data such as:nameaddressemail addresspostal addressphone numberbirthdayidentification numbers such as social security number, tax identification number, ID card number or matriculation numberbanking data such as account number, credit information, account balances and more.According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), your IP address is also personal data. IT experts can use your IP address to determine at least the approximate location of your device and subsequently your location as the connection owner. Therefore, storing an IP address also requires a legal basis within the scope of the GDPR. There are also so-called \u201cspecial categories\u201d of personal data, which are particularly worthy of protection. These include:racial and ethnic originpolitical opinionsreligious or ideological beliefsUnion membershipgenetic data such as data obtained from blood or saliva samplesbiometric data (this is information about psychological, physical or behavioural characteristics that can identify an individual).health DataData relating to sexual orientation or sex lifeProfilingDefinition according to Article 4 of the GDPRFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:\u201cProfiling\u201d means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;Explanation: Profiling collects various personal data about an individual in order to learn more about that individual. On the internet, profiling is often used for advertising purposes or for credit checks. Web and advertising analysis programs e. g. collect data about your behaviour and interests on a website. This results in a special user profile that can be used to target advertising to specific target groups.ControllerDefinition according to Article 4 of the GDPRFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:\u201ccontroller\u201d means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;Explanation: In our example, we are responsible for the processing of your personal data and are therefore the \u201ccontroller\u201d. If we pass on collected data to other service providers for processing, they are considered \u201ccontract processors\u201d. For this, a \u201cData Processing Agreement (DPA)\u201d must be concluded.ProcessingDefinition according to Article 4 of the GDPRFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:\u201cprocessing\u201d means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;Note: When we talk about processing in our Privacy Policy, we talk about any type of data processing. As mentioned above in the original GDPR declaration, this includes not only the collection but also the storage and processing of data.Closing RemarksCongratulations! If you are reading these lines, you have most likely familiarised yourself with our entire Privacy Policy \u2013 or at least scrolled down here. As you can see from the scope of our Privacy Policy, we do not take the protection of your personal data lightly.We find it important to inform you about the processing of your personal data to the best of our abilities. In doing so, we not only want to tell you which data is processed but also explain to you why we use various software programs. In general, Privacy Policies have very technical and legal jargon. However, since most of you are not web developers or solicitors, we wanted to take a different approach and explain the facts in simple and clear language. Of course, this is not always possible due to the subject matter. Therefore, you can also find a more detailed explanation of the most important terms at the end of the Privacy Policy.If you have any questions about data protection on our website, please do not hesitate to contact us or the responsible body. We wish you all the best and hope to soon welcome you to our website again.All texts are copyrighted.\n            ", "length": 344911, "excerpt": "This page contains information on WolfVision's privacy policy.", "siteName": "WolfVision GmbH", "applied": false}
