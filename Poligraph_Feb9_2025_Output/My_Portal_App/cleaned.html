			<h2 style="text-align: left;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This privacy policy was last updated on 14th of July, 2021.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This privacy policy tells you how My Portal App uses your personal data when you visit our website, interact with us, and subscribe to our services.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It also tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important that you read this privacy policy, together with any other privacy policies we may provide, so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have any questions, or would like to exercise your privacy rights, please follow the instructions in this privacy policy. See How to contact My Portal App about privacy below.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Our website and the company behind My Portal App</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our website at MyPortalApp.com is the customer facing web presence that introduces the My Portal App software and enables access to the software, submission of questions and support requests. This website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My Portal App is made up of the following legal entity:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A North Carolina Corporation with the address: SaaS Services, Inc., 1321 Upland Dr. STE 6351, Houston, TX 77043</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SaaS Services, Inc. is the data controller responsible for this website and any handling of personal data carried out by or on behalf of SaaS Services, Inc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When we mention “My Portal App”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this privacy policy, we are referring to SaaS Services, Inc., which is the company responsible for handling your private data.</p>
<h2 id="eu-us-and-swiss-us-privacy-shield-framework" style="text-align: left;">Our commitment to your privacy</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The privacy of your data is a big deal to us. We’ll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or fix a software bug. We’ll never open any uploaded files unless you ask us to. We log all access to all accounts by IP address, so we can always verify that no unauthorized access has happened for as long as the logs are kept.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This policy applies to personal data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and from Switzerland that is collected, used, and retained by us in the United States.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Law Enforcement</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">While we may be required to disclose your personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, My Portal App won’t otherwise hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We flat-out reject such other requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data without a court order. And unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Third Party</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You understand that My Portal App uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to provide you with our services. These service providers may have access to your personal information. A current list of vendors is available upon request.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">PERSONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We collect a variety of information about our wonderful customers (you!) and visitors to the My Portal App website. This personal data falls into these categories:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Identity Data includes title, first name, last name, username or similar identifier and an encrypted version of your login/password. If you interact with us through social media, this may include your social media username.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Transaction Data includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Profile Data includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, preferences, feedback and survey responses, as well as any profile data which we have added (for example, using analytics and profiling).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Usage Data includes information about how you use our website, products and services.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service of the specific application, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We transfer information about you if My Portal App is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, My Portal App will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences. If you use any of these types of personal data on any functionality you design or create on myportalapp.com, we will not be able to tell. We will treat all the personal data included in any created functionality as ordinary personal data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remember, if you choose not to share personal data with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we might not be able to provide our services to you or your organization.</p>

			<h2>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS &amp; GDPR</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may have heard about the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe. GDPR gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us on the Site. Accordingly, My Portal App recognizes and will comply with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by applicable law. The rights under GDPR include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Right of Access. This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Right to Correction. This is your right to request correction of your personal information.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Right to Erasure. This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession (also known as the “Right to be forgotten”). However, if applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your information, fulfillment of your request may prevent you from using My Portal App’s services and may result in closing your account.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Right to Complain. You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</li>

<li style="text-align: left;">Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.

We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p>We have appointed a data privacy manager who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy policy.
