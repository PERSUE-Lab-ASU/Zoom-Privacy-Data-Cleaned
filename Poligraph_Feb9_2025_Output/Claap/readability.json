We have security practices and development procedures in place, such as encryption and access controls, to secure the information we collect, store, and use.&nbsp;</p><p>While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
