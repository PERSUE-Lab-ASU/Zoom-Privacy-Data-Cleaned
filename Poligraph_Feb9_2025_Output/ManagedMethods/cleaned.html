The educational institution retains full ownership rights to the personal information and education records it provides to ManagedMethods.</p><p>(2) ManagedMethods does not retain or store user generated content.</p><p>(3) ManagedMethods will not use any information in a student record for any purpose other than those required or specifically permitted by the ManagedMethods Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Student data will only be used for educational purposes (or as authorized by the parent or student).</p><p>(4) Parents, legal guardians, or eligible students may review personally identifiable information in the student’s records and correct erroneous information by contacting their educational institution. Additionally, ManagedMethods users may access, correct, update, or delete personal information in their profile by signing into console, accessing their user account, and making the appropriate changes.</p><p>(5) ManagedMethods is committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of student records. Towards this end, we take the following actions: (a) we limit employee access to student data to only those employees with a need to such access to fulfill their job responsibilities; (b) we conduct background checks on our employees that may have access to student data; (c) we conduct regular employee privacy and data security training and education; and (e) we protect personal information with technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards in order to protect against unauthorized access, release or use.</p><p>(6) In the event of an unauthorized disclosure of a student’s records Managed Methods will promptly notify Users, unless specifically directed not to provide such notification by law enforcement officials. The notification shall identify: (i) the date and nature of the unauthorized use or disclosure, (ii) the Private Data used or disclosed, (iii) general description of what occurred including who made the unauthorized use or received the unauthorized disclosure, (iv) what ManagedMethods has done or shall do to mitigate any effect of the unauthorized use or disclosure, (v) what corrective action ManagedMethods has taken or shall take to prevent future similar unauthorized use or disclosure, (vi) and who at ManagedMethods the User can contact.

When schools use our Services, the school (including a teacher, administrator or school district) is required to consent to the collection and use of personal information from students as part of signing up to use the Services.</p><p>We will not collect more information than is required to use our Services. The information collected is not made publicly available. ManagedMethods is not a platform in which a student, including children under 13, can make their information publicly available.</p><p>By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of the personal information, anonymous information, and aggregate information about your students as described in this Privacy Policy, and you confirm you are authorized to consent to the collection and use of this information.</p><p>You may withdraw your consent to our processing of the personal information of your students at any time.

Such information may include, but is not limited to, name, address, online activity, images, electronic communications, school work, etc.</p><p>ManagedMethods participates in the iKeepSafe Safe Harbor program.

You can see when the last update was by looking at the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. We won’t reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. If we make any significant changes, we’ll provide prominent notice by posting a notice on the Service or the Managed Methods Website and notifying you by email (using the email address you provided), so you can review and make sure you know about them.</p><p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time, to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of&nbsp;<strong>personal information</strong>&nbsp;through the Service and Managed Methods Website. If you don’t agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account. By continuing to use the Service or the Managed Methods Website after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy.</p><p>(13) Managed Methods will limit use of student data only in the context of a support issue with School permission. Managed Methods will use student data to troubleshoot issues within the customer environment per a support ticket.</p><p>(14) Managed Methods third-party vendors do not resell student data and only use student data in technical support with School permission. Please see the below Section 5-12 for how we require third parties to handle student data.</p><p>(15) We will only contract with future vendors that are consistent with Student Privacy Pledge principles.</p><p>(16) The below Section 5 details how we secure student personal information.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, the security of Customer Data may be compromised at any time. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of personal identifiable information and disclaim any assurance that such information will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.</p><p>If ManagedMethods becomes aware of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party or that any user data was used for an unauthorized purpose, we will comply with relevant state and other data breach laws. We will notify IT administrators of any breach resulting in unauthorized release of data electronically, at minimum, and without unreasonable delay so that you can take appropriate steps. The notification will include: date of the breach, types of information that were subject to the breach, general description of what occurred, and the steps ManagedMethods is taking to address the breach.</p><p>(12) Regarding third party service providers ManagedMethods will never sell or rent your personal information or non-personal information. We will only share personal information with a limited set of third-party service providers necessary to provide or develop our services (such as database hosting) or as required by law, and we will be transparent about who these service providers are. We will contractually require that these service providers process personal information in accordance with our instructions and consistent with this Privacy Policy and ensure that these service providers employ reasonable and comprehensive data protection and security protocols.</p><p>ManagedMethods uses the following third party service providers:</p><ul><li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Platform</a> – Hosting.
