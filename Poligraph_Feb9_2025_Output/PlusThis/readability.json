Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>\n\n            <p>Voluntary submissions of personally identifiable information can occur for various reasons, such as if you request to receive information about our services, or if you subscribe to one of our mailing lists.  If you subscribe to one of our mailing lists, we generally collect your name, email address, and optionally your telephone or other information if you provide it to us so we can customize your experience and better serve your needs.</p>\n\n            <p>In order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable information, like names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sometimes credit card information when such information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors.  Most of your customer information is stored in Infusionsoft, and not directly on our servers.  However, your credit card information is not stored by us, as it is passed through directly to Stripe for your safety and security.  We also may store limited information about our customer\u2019s customer on some software features in an audit log, so we can validate the address in order to re-run the transaction if it results in an error for some reason.</p>\n\n            <p>We will only use your personal information for the following purposes: (1) to deliver the products and/or services to you that you have requested; (2) to validate your compliance with the terms and conditions; (3) for content improvement and feedback purposes; (4) to reach you, when necessary, regarding your use of the web site or product(s); and (5) for the few situations described below to better serve you.</p>\n\n            <p>We will NEVER share your personally identifiable information with third parties unless you have given us explicit permission to do so, such as in order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted from us.

If you wish to stop seeing ads from us on Facebook, you can turn off the ad by using the following steps:</p>\n\n            <ol type=\"i\">\n                <li>From within Facebook, go to the advertisement you want to turn off.</li>\n                <li>Click on the drop-down arrow in the top corner of the ad (that may be in the top right corner or top left corner).</li>\n                <li>Click on \"Hide ad\". </li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <p>If you wish to stop seeing ads from us in Google Ads, you can turn off the ad by using the following steps:</p>\n\n            <ol type=\"i\">\n                <li>Go to the advertisement you want to turn off.</li>\n                <li>Click on the x in the top left corner.</li>\n                <li>Click on \"Stop seeing this ad\".</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <p>Other ad platforms we may use in the future have similar ways you can turn off any ad from us to stop seeing it.</p>\n\n            <p>In addition, you agree that by submitting your telephone contact information on this web site and/or registering to receive the product and/or service offered herein, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry, and/or an application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (ATSR), 16 CFR \u2018310 et seq. and any applicable state and local \u201cdo not call\u201d regulations. We retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR and the applicable state regulations.</p>\n\n            <p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may be required to disclose personal information in some instances, such as: (a) when required by law wherein we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, and/or subpoena; (b) in the event that Company is sold or acquired; or (c) in the event that we believe that the web site is being, or has been, used in violation of our terms and conditions or to commit unlawful acts.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>\n\n            <p>We also may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information to help us make your experience more enjoyable, measure site activity to identify future improvements that should be made, and compile aggregate data to help serve site visitors better.</p>\n\n            <p>For example, we may use session and persistent \u201ccookies,\u201d session logs, web beacons, GIF/pixel tags, banner ads, third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Google Analytics), third party retargeting networks that may display our advertisements to you on other sites that you visit to remind you about us, and third party networks that serve user-requested emails (e.g., for a refer-a-friend email) to collect non-personally identifiable or other aggregated information about site visitors.</p>\n\n            <p>Cookies are text files that are used by your computer\u2019s web browser to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance your user experience with our web site.

However, be aware that disabling cookies may keep you from having access to some functions or services on our web site or the web-hosted software that runs on our web site.</p>\n\n            <p>Emails or newsletters that we send electronically may use techniques such as web beacons or pixel tags to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader\u2019s experience, such as the number of emails that are opened, whether they were forwarded or printed, the type of device from which they were opened, and the location (e.g. city, state, and county) associated with the applicable IP address.</p>\n\n            <p>If you visit this site with an open ID (such as Facebook), you may also be sharing and integrating data with third-party social media sites, and we may track aggregate data about the number of visits to this site with an open ID, the number of items \u201cliked\u201d on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.</p>\n\n            <p>Other parties such as advertising partners and analytics companies may also be collecting information about your online activity across various websites over time. The information collected by those third parties may include identifiers that allow those third parties to tailor the ads that they serve to your computer or other device.</p>\n\n            <p>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals other than cookies, we do not currently respond to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals that are undefined.  We are waiting for the online industry to develop a common protocol for how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including those described herein.</p>\n\n\n            <p><strong>2.

Third Party Actions</strong></p>\n\n            <p>Our web site may contain links to web sites operated by others. Each of those third-party web sites maintains its own policies about the collection, use and security of Personal Information. Our Company is not responsible for the manner in which others use your Personal Information.

We do not guarantee that you will receive an alert when you leave our web site, and it is your responsibility to determine when you have left the web site and entered onto a third-party web site that is governed by different privacy practices. The Company recommends that you review any third-party web site's privacy policies before submitting any information. We assume no responsibility for and shall not be liable for the privacy, terms of use, or other policies of any third-party web site, any damage to, or viruses that may infect your computer equipment or other property, or for any loss or corruption of data resulting from any third-party web site that you may have navigated to or accessed from links hosted on or contained on our web site.</p>\n\n            <p>We pride ourselves in recommending quality companies.

To protect user privacy, you must send such a request from the account information we have on file or the request will not be honored. <strong>We reserve the right to retain any data that we are required to maintain under applicable laws.</strong>  Some data will be anonymized rather than deleted; this means that some of the data will be held in a form that cannot be connected to you personally.

Note To California Residents\n\n            If you live in the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request that companies who conduct business in California provide you with a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.\n\n            Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (often referred to as \"unsubscribe\") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, that the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.\n\n            This Site qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.\n\n            If you are a California resident and want to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Please send an email to the Privacy Administrator at info@plusthis.com, or you may contact us via regular mail at:\n                2490 S Gilbert Rd., Suite 200-B\n                Chandler, AZ 85286\n\n            All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled \"Your California Privacy Rights\" on the email subject line or envelope and clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.\n\n            We do not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile.
