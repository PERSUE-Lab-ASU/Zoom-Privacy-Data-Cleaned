Notice</p>\n\n<p><br>\nWe notify our job applicants, consumers, customers, suppliers and others located in the EU about the purposes for which we collect and use Personal Data, the types of third parties to which we disclose the information, the choices job applicants, consumers, customers, suppliers, and others have for limiting the use and disclosure of their information, and how to contact us about our practices concerning Personal Data.<br>\nWhen we receive Personal Data from our subsidiaries, affiliates or other entities in the EU, we will use and disclose such information in accordance with the notices provided by such entities and the choices made by the individuals to whom such Personal Data relates.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>2.

We do not use Personal Data for purposes incompatible with the purposes for which the information was originally collected without notifying the relevant consumers, customers, suppliers, and others of such uses and offering an opportunity to opt-out.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>In addition, we may disclose Personal Data (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials based on an enforceable government request or as may be required under applicable law, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>4.

This Notice outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Privacy Shield privacy principles for Personal Data.\n\n\u200b\n\nIntellectSpace\u2019s participation in the Privacy Shield is subject to investigation and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n\u200b\n\nUnder certain conditions detailed in the Privacy Shield, Data Subjects may be able to invoke binding arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel to be created by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the event we transfer Personal Data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy to a third party acting as a controller, we will do so consistent with any notice provided to Data Subjects and any consent they have given, and only if the third party has given us contractual assurances that it will (i) process the Personal Data for limited and specified purposes consistent with any consent provided by the Data Subjects, (ii) provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles and notify us if it makes a determination that it cannot do so; and (iii) cease processing of the Personal Data or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate if it makes such a determination. If IntellectSpace has knowledge that a third party acting as a controller is processing Personal Data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy in a way that is contrary to the Privacy Shield Principles, IntellectSpace will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing. IntellectSpace remains liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if an agent processes personal data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, except where IntellectSpace is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, IntellectSpace commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.

It addresses the export of personal data outside the EU.\n\n\u200b\n\nOur policy is to respect all laws that apply to our business and this includes the GDPR. We also appreciate that our customers have requirements under the GDPR that are directly impacted by their use of IntellectSpace products and services. We are committed to helping our customers stay in compliance with the GDPR and their local requirements.\n\n\u200b\n\nIntellectSpace operates internationally and transfers Personal Identifiable Information (Personal Data) to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy. We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer Personal Data around the world. These include your consent, the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, and EC approved privacy and security protections explained in this Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information when it is transferred. If you reside in or are located within the European Economic Area (\u201dEEA\u201d) and such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as you would have within the EEA to the extent feasible under applicable law. We participate in and commit to adhering to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework when transferring data from the EEA to the United States.\n\n\u200b\n\nIndividuals who reside in or are located in the EEA can access further information about their rights under the GDPR at\u00a0https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data- protection/reform/rights-citizens/my-rights/what-are-my-rights_en\n\nPrivacy Principles\n\n\u200b\n\nIntellectSpace's practices regarding the collection, storage, transfer, use and other processing of Personal Data comply with the Privacy Shield and GDPR principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity, and enforcement and oversight.\n\n\u200b\n\n1. Notice\n\n\nWe notify our job applicants, consumers, customers, suppliers and others located in the EU about the purposes for which we collect and use Personal Data, the types of third parties to which we disclose the information, the choices job applicants, consumers, customers, suppliers, and others have for limiting the use and disclosure of their information, and how to contact us about our practices concerning Personal Data.\nWhen we receive Personal Data from our subsidiaries, affiliates or other entities in the EU, we will use and disclose such information in accordance with the notices provided by such entities and the choices made by the individuals to whom such Personal Data relates.\n\n\u200b\n\n2. Purpose of Collection and Use of Personal Data\n\n\nIntellectSpace collects certain Personal Data such as name, company, title, and email address. We do not collect sensitive Personal Data of consumers, customers or suppliers, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or other sensitive information as defined by the Privacy Shield framework.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe use Personal Data of consumers, customers, suppliers and others (i) to respond to your requests, (ii) to evaluate the quality of our products and services, (iii) to communicate with you about our products, services, and related issues, (iv) to notify you of and administer offers, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions, and (v) for internal administrative and analytics purposes and to comply with our legal obligations, policies, and procedures.\n\n\u200b\n\n3.

With respect to Personal Data we share with other third parties, we provide job applicants, consumers, customers, suppliers, and others located in the EU with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing or have their Personal Data deleted (sometimes called \u201cthe right to be forgotten\u201d). Please email us via\u00a0privacy@intellectspace.com\u00a0if you would like to opt-out. We do not use Personal Data for purposes incompatible with the purposes for which the information was originally collected without notifying the relevant consumers, customers, suppliers, and others of such uses and offering an opportunity to opt-out.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn addition, we may disclose Personal Data (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials based on an enforceable government request or as may be required under applicable law, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.\n\n\u200b\n\n4. Onward Transfer of Personal Data\n\n\nWe may share Personal Data with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. We require service providers to whom we disclose Personal Data and who are not subject to laws based on the GDPR to either (i) subscribe to the Privacy Shield principles or (ii) contractually agree to provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield and GDPR principles.

We also provide a reasonable opportunity to correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate. We may limit or deny access to Personal Data where providing such access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Privacy Shield and GDPR principles.
