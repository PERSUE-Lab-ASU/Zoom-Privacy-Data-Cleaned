<p>At WPCal.io, accessible from wpcal.io, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that are collected and recorded by wpcal.io and how we use it.</p>

<p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in wpcal.io. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Consent</h3>

<p>By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Information we collect</h3>

<p>The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.</p>

<p>When you register for an Account, we may ask for your contact information, including items such as name, company name, address, email address, and telephone number.</p>
<p>We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Website. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources.</p>
<p>In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Website. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date, and time.</p>
<p>WPCal.io is not directed to children under sixteen (16) years of age and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 16. If we discover that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will promptly delete such Personal Information from our systems.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 class="document-header">Information You Provide Voluntarily</h3>

<p><strong>Appointment Information.</strong> A WPCal.io User, Invitee, or a third-party may voluntarily give us certain information. This can include names, email addresses, and phone numbers; email addresses of other people; the subject of the meeting; and any other information provided to us or as required by the WPCal.io User upon scheduling, pursuant to the WPCal.io Terms of Use.

</li>
<li><strong>Calendar Information.</strong> A WPCal.io User may connect their calendar with WPCal.io. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when you’re busy. We never store who you are meeting with, their email address, the meeting title, or any other details about the appointments in your connected calendar.</li>
<li><strong>Billing Information.</strong> If you purchase a premium version of WPCal.io, our third-party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, card type, and the expiration date.</li>

<h3 class="document-header wp-block-heading">Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<p>Like many websites, we and our Service Providers use Cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device subject to your opt-out preferences (see Your Rights and Choices section below). Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Website, improve your experience, and tailor marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><strong>Log &amp; Device data.</strong> When you use WPCal.io, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website. This log data may include the web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone or location. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</li>
<li><strong>Cookie data.</strong> Depending on how you’re accessing our services and subject to your opt-out preferences, we may use “Cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our Website, unique to your WPCal.io account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use Cookies, we may use ‘session’ Cookies (that last until you close your browser) or ‘persistent’ Cookies (that last until you or your browser deletes them). For example, we may use Cookies to keep you logged into WPCal.io. Some of the Cookies we use are associated with your WPCal.io account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other Cookies are not.</li>
<li><strong>Other Web Site Analytics Services.&nbsp;</strong>Subject to your opt-out preferences (see ‘Your Rights and Choices’ below), we use third-party Service Providers such as Google Analytics to provide certain analytics and Viewer interactions services to WPCal.io in connection with our operation of our Website, including the collection and tracking of certain data and information regarding the characteristics and activities of visitors to WPCal.io. You may opt-out of relevant cookies using opt-out features on their respective websites.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br>Data Retention</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p class="">We retain personal information regarding you or your use of the Services for as long as your Account is active or for as long as needed to provide you or our Users with the Services. We also retain personal information for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect us in the event of disputes and to enforce our agreements and to protect our and others’ interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="">The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your Account is active, while the period for which we keep a support message is based on how long has passed since the last submission in the thread.</p>
<p class="">As Users may have a seasonal site or come back to us after an Account becomes inactive, we don’t immediately delete your personal information when your trial expires or you cancel all Paid Services. Instead, we keep your personal information for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.</p>
<p class="">You may delete your Account by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@wpcal.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@wpcal.io</a> and WPCal.io will delete the personal information it holds about you (unless we need to retain it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy).</p>
<p class="">Please note that in the course of providing the Services, we collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or de-personalized information which we may retain indefinitely.</p>
<h3><br>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>

<p>Like any other website, wpcal.io uses ‘cookies’. These cookies are used to store information including visitors’ preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users’ experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors’ browser type and/or other information.</p>

<p>For more general information on cookies, please read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cookieconsent.com/what-are-cookies/">“What Are Cookies”</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">CCPA Privacy Rights (Do Not Sell My Personal Information)</h3>

<p>Request that a business delete any personal data about the consumer that a business has collected.</p>

<p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
