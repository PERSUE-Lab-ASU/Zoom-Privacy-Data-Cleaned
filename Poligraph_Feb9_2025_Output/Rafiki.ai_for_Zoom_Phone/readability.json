Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.Rafiki is the \u201cData Processor\u201d of the Rafiki Website, CRM & Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our \u201cService Providers\" processing such data will assume the role of \u201cData Processor\u201d\u201d.Rafiki is the \u201cData Processor\u201d of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the \u201cData Processor\u201d of such data; and our \"Service Providers\" who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201csub-processors\u201d of such data.Rafiki is the \u201cData Processor\u201d of Rafiki User Data. Such data is processed by Rafiki for its own purposes (as described in the Data Uses Section above), as an independent processor; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.

The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control). At Rafiki we strive to protect and secure our customers\u2019 data to the highest levels, such as the data privacy obligations in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) \u2013 primarily the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d).
