CoSo Cloud will not be held responsible or liable for poor voice quality due to insufficient Internet bandwidth or improper VLAN configurations at your location. You also acknowledge that other systems and applications sharing the same Internet connection that the voice conversations are using may affect the voice quality of those voice conversations.

Service Level Agreement.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Service Availability Objective.</strong> CoSo Cloud\u2019s objective is to make reasonable efforts to provide Service Availability of 99.99% as measured on a monthly basis for all production-managed services. Service Availability is defined as the time that the Service is capable of receiving, processing, and responding to requests and calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of minutes the Service is available during the applicable month minus the total number of minutes of Downtime (if applicable) experienced by all users in a given calendar month, all by the number of total minutes in the applicable month, excluding (a) Scheduled Maintenance, (b) Emergency Maintenance; (c) Customer Error Incidents, (d) Force Majeure, (e) Product Defects, (f) factors outside of CoSo Cloud reasonable control, and (g) errors caused by Customers exceeding provisioned capacity.</li>\n<li><strong>Remedy for Failure to Achieve Service Availability Objective.</strong> CoSo Cloud will calculate your Service Availability at your request during a given calendar month. In the event that the Service Availability Objective was not met in a given month, then for each day in such month that the duration of the Service unavailability exceeds four (4) continuous hours, you are entitled to receive a one (1) day Service credit up to a maximum of 30 days, subject to the Agreement and requirements of this Section 9 (Service Level Agreement).</li>\n<li><strong>Service Credit Claims.</strong> CoSo Cloud will only consider the Service unavailable if you opened a trouble ticket relating to the Service unavailability with the CoSo Cloud customer support department within three (3) business days of the Service unavailability. To obtain credit for CoSo Cloud\u2019s failure to meet the Service Availability Objective, you must request such credit in writing no later than the calendar month following the month of the Service unavailability giving rise to your credit request. In the event of a conflict between the data in your records and CoSo Cloud\u2019s records, the data in CoSo Cloud\u2019s records shall prevail. If you purchased the Service on a monthly or pay-per-use basis, you are not eligible for any credits arising from or relating to Service unavailability. Any Service credit due hereunder will be applied to your account at the conclusion of the then-current term for the applicable Service. The Service credit offered in this Section 9 shall be your sole and exclusive remedy for any failure of the Service or any failure of CoSo Cloud to meet the Service Availability Objective. Any unused Service credits shall expire upon termination of this Agreement.</li>\n<li><strong>Definitions.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\u201cScheduled Maintenance\u201d is defined as any maintenance performed during CoSo Cloud\u2019s standard maintenance windows:\n<ol>\n<li>US Deployments: 21:00 Friday ET to 06:00 ET Saturday</li>\n<li>European Deployments: 17:00 Saturday BST to 23:00 BST Saturday</li>\n<li>Asian Data Centers: 00:00 Sunday HKT to 06:00 HKT Sunday</li>\n<li>Any maintenance window(s) defined in the Master Service Agreement.</li>\n<li>Any other maintenance of which you are given at least forty-eight (48) hour advance notice.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>CoSo Cloud may perform maintenance on some or all of the Service to upgrade hardware or software that operates or supports the Service, implement security measures, or address any other issues it deems appropriate for its continued operation.</p></li>\n<li>\u201cEmergency Maintenance\u201d is defined as any period of time in which your environment is modified for the purposes of stabilizing or securing the system in response to immediate threats.

Term and&nbsp;Termination.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Term.</strong> This Agreement will continue until terminated in accordance with the provisions below.

You acknowledge that two-way Voice over Internet Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) conversations between your location and CoSo Cloud\u2019s data centers consume Internet bandwidth and that in order to deliver high voice quality, the Internet connection must be sized appropriately for your usage environment. You further acknowledge that disruptions in the public Internet and in the ability of you or CoSo Cloud (or any affiliate or service provider thereof) to maintain sufficient Internet bandwidth may affect the quality of any connection between you and CoSo Cloud.

CoSo Cloud will not be held responsible or liable for poor voice quality due to insufficient Internet bandwidth or improper VLAN configurations at your location. You also acknowledge that other systems and applications sharing the same Internet connection that the voice conversations are using may affect the voice quality of those voice conversations. In order to achieve the highest level of voice quality, CoSo Cloud strongly recommends that you use a dedicated Internet connection for voice traffic.

This provision does not limit any additional rights and remedies at law or in equity that CoSo Cloud may have due to unauthorized use of the Service.\n\n4.

Information disclosed orally shall be considered Confidential Information only if such information is confirmed in writing as being Confidential Information within a reasonable time after the initial disclosure. Confidential Information may also include information of a third party that is in the possession of one of the parties and is disclosed to the other party under this Agreement. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the Service, related documentation, specifications, pricing, disclosures in connection with the Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Confidential Information shall remain the sole property of the disclosing party or its licensors.\nNondisclosure. The parties agree, both during the term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years (or, as applicable, with respect to Confidential Information that is a trade secret, for an indefinite period) after its termination, to hold each other\u2019s Confidential Information in confidence and not to disclose such information in any form to any third party without the express written consent of the disclosing party, except to employees and consultants performing services for the benefit of the receiving party who are under a written non-disclosure agreement protecting the applicable Confidential Information in a manner no less restrictive than this Agreement.

A receiving party facing legal action to disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party shall promptly notify and provide the disclosing party the opportunity to oppose such disclosure or obtain a protective order and shall continue to treat such information as Confidential Information. This Section 8(c) shall not be construed as granting or conferring any rights to either party by license or otherwise, expressly or implicitly, to any Confidential Information.\nExceptions to Confidentiality.

Service Level Agreement.\u00a0\n\nService Availability Objective. CoSo Cloud\u2019s objective is to make reasonable efforts to provide Service Availability of 99.99% as measured on a monthly basis for all production-managed services. Service Availability is defined as the time that the Service is capable of receiving, processing, and responding to requests and calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of minutes the Service is available during the applicable month minus the total number of minutes of Downtime (if applicable) experienced by all users in a given calendar month, all by the number of total minutes in the applicable month, excluding (a) Scheduled Maintenance, (b) Emergency Maintenance; (c) Customer Error Incidents, (d) Force Majeure, (e) Product Defects, (f) factors outside of CoSo Cloud reasonable control, and (g) errors caused by Customers exceeding provisioned capacity.\nRemedy for Failure to Achieve Service Availability Objective. CoSo Cloud will calculate your Service Availability at your request during a given calendar month. In the event that the Service Availability Objective was not met in a given month, then for each day in such month that the duration of the Service unavailability exceeds four (4) continuous hours, you are entitled to receive a one (1) day Service credit up to a maximum of 30 days, subject to the Agreement and requirements of this Section 9 (Service Level Agreement).\nService Credit Claims. CoSo Cloud will only consider the Service unavailable if you opened a trouble ticket relating to the Service unavailability with the CoSo Cloud customer support department within three (3) business days of the Service unavailability. To obtain credit for CoSo Cloud\u2019s failure to meet the Service Availability Objective, you must request such credit in writing no later than the calendar month following the month of the Service unavailability giving rise to your credit request. In the event of a conflict between the data in your records and CoSo Cloud\u2019s records, the data in CoSo Cloud\u2019s records shall prevail. If you purchased the Service on a monthly or pay-per-use basis, you are not eligible for any credits arising from or relating to Service unavailability.
