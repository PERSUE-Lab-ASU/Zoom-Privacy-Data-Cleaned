If you directly engage with any of our partners, please note that any aspect of that engagement which is not directly related to the Services and directed by Verbit is beyond the scope of Verbit\u2019s Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy, and may therefore be governed by the partner\u2019s terms and privacy policy.\nCustomers and other Users: Customer Data\u00a0is typically shared and is available to the Users belonging to such customer\u2019s account, as well as to Viewers such data was shared with by said Users.\u00a0Verbit User Data\u00a0is shared with the administrator of the customer\u2019s account to which such User belongs (including data and communications concerning such User\u2019s account).

This would typically include information such as the e-mail address used to identify you in our systems (in which case we might require additional verification steps to ensure that you have access to that e-mail).\u00a0 Such additional data, along with details and correspondence related to your request, will be then retained by us for legal and compliance purposes (e.g., as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request, and of how the request was handled), in accordance with Section 4 above.\nWe may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data related to others.\nIn compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, and the UK Extension of the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, Verbit Inc. commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data.

Note that if you do contact us in this regard, we may share your communications with the relevant customer and its account Users; and that we may also share the contact details of the account administrator with individuals who sent us such a request or query relating to this account.\n\n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                        10. Data Controller/Processor\nCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), UK GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the \u201cdata controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cdata processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.\nVerbit is the \u201cdata controller\u201d (or \u201cbusiness\u201d) of Verbit Website, CRM & Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cdata processor\u201d.\nVerbit is both a \u201cdata controller\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d (or \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201cservice provider\u201d, respectively) of Customer Data. Where we process on behalf of our customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data; and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201csub-processors\u201d of such data), we are a \u2018processor.\u2019 Where we process such data for our own processes, namely to improve the Services and our technology, we are a \u2018controller.\u2019\nVerbit is both a \u201cdata controller\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d (or \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201cservice provider\u201d, respectively) of Verbit User Data. Such data is processed by Verbit for its own purposes (as described in Section 2 above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; While those certain portions of it which are included in\u00a0Customer Data\u00a0will be processed by us on our customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.\nAccordingly, where it is providing the Services, Verbit processes\u00a0Customer Data in accordance with our customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our data processing addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer. Each customer, as the controller (or business) of their Customer Data, is solely responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers or businesses. This includes establishing a legal basis for proceeding and providing adequate notice to data subjects whose data may be contained in Customer Data \u2013 including sufficient reference to the processing of their personal data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.\n\n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                        11.
