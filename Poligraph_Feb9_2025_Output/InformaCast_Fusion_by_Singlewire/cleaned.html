<p>Subject to exceptions permitted by applicable laws and verification of your identity, if you live in California, you may exercise the following rights with regard to your Personal Information. Capitalized terms in this Section that are not defined elsewhere in this Privacy Policy have the definitions set forth in the CCPA.</p>
<h3><em>Sharing Information</em></h3>

<ul>

<h3><em>We Do Not Use or Disclose Sensitive Information</em></h3>
<p>We do not use or disclose sensitive Personal Information for any purpose other than our business purposes, as specified under the CCPA.</p>
<h3><em>Your Rights and Choices</em></h3>
<p>The CCPA provides consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Information, subject to certain exceptions. If you live in California, this section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
<h3><u>Right to Know</u></h3>
<p>You have a right to request that we disclose certain information about you and our collection of your Personal Information over the last 12 months. Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will disclose to you as required under the CCPA:</p>

</ul>
<h3><u>Right to Delete</u></h3>
<p>Except in certain cases where the CCPA does not require us to do so or provides an exception, you have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retain. Once we receive and verify your request, we will comply with such request (and direct our service providers and other applicable third parties to do the same).</p>
<h3><u>Right to Correct</u></h3>
<p>You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we collect about you. If we receive a verifiable request, we will consider it, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information and the purposes of the processing of the Personal Information. We may deny your request if we are unable to verify your identity, or if we determine that the contested Personal Information is more likely than not accurate based on the totality of the circumstances. We may request that you provide us with documentation that is relevant to your request.</p>
<p>Please note, we may choose to delete the contested Personal Information as an alternative to correcting it if doing so would not negatively impact you or you consent to our deletion.</p>
<h3><u>Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information</u></h3>
<p>We do not sell Personal Information. You have the right to opt-out of us sharing your Personal Information with a third party for targeted advertising. To make a request, please submit a <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/8fe9d6bc-e251-4c09-8c90-4e1a107ded1d/926a4260-80b5-46aa-95c9-c88d4813d825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure request</a> or contact us using the information in the “Contact Us” section below.</p>
<h3><em>Exercising Your Rights</em></h3>
<p>In addition to any other options provided in this Privacy Policy, to exercise your rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by visiting the <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/8fe9d6bc-e251-4c09-8c90-4e1a107ded1d/926a4260-80b5-46aa-95c9-c88d4813d825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request portal</a> or contact us using the information in the “Contact Us” section below us.</p>
<h3><em>Who Can Make a Request</em></h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. See the section titled “Using an Authorized Agent” below for more information. A parent or legal guardian may make a request on behalf of their child.</p>
<h3><em>Verifying Your Request</em></h3>
<p>In order for us to process your request, you must provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information sufficient to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.</li>
<li>A request with sufficient detail to allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we receive your request to exercise your rights under the CCPA, we will: (a) acknowledge receipt of your request; (b) try to match the information you provide in making the request with information we already maintain about you; (c) if required to verify your identity, we may ask you to provide additional information, including Personal Information; and (d) consider various factors when determining how to verify your identity, such as the sensitivity and value of the data, the risk of harm, the likelihood of fraud, etc.</p>
<p>We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<h3><em>Response Timing and Format</em></h3>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (an additional 45 days up to a total of 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
<p>For right to know requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information to you.</p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. If applicable, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request.</p>
<p>If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<h3><em>Using an Authorized Agent</em></h3>
<p>You have a right to submit requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA through an authorized agent.
