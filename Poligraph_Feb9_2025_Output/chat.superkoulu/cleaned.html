    <h2>Responding to complaints</h2>
    <p>
        
        On occasion, our school and the Department’s central and regional offices receive complaints from others. 
        Our school and/or the Department’s central or regional offices will use and disclose information as considered appropriate to 
        respond to these complaints (including responding to complaints made to external organisations or agencies).

    <h2>Accessing your information</h2>
    <p>
        
        All individuals, or their authorised representative(s), have a right to access, update and correct information that our school holds about them.

    <p>
        
        In some circumstances, an authorised representative may not be entitled to information about the student.
        These circumstances include when granting access would not be in the student’s best interests or would breach our duty of care to the student, 
        would be contrary to student’s wishes or would unreasonably impact on the privacy of another person.

        When using software and contracted service providers to manage information, our school assesses these according to the appropriate processes. 
        One example of this is that staff passwords for school systems are strong and updated on a regular basis, consistent with the School’s 
        password policy.
        
    </p>
