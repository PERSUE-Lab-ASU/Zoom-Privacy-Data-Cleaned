In some states, like California, this information sharing may qualify as a “share” or a “sale,” while in other states, like Virginia, this information sharing may qualify as “targeted advertising” (collectively,“personalized advertising”). If you wish to opt-out of personalized advertising, you can opt out of said sharing by contacting us as set forth below.<strong><br><br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correction: </strong>to request the correction of inaccurate Personal Information that we may have on file about you.<strong><br><br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain additional details regarding our information practices: </strong>You may have the right to request disclosures regarding our information practices.
