Data Retention and Security</h2><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN"><strong class="framer-text">How long will we store your personal information</strong></p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">We will usually store the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out above, in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">The criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">(a) Legitimate Interests. Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.&nbsp;</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">(b) Consent. Where we are processing personal information based on your consent, we generally will retain the information until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfil the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">(c) Contract. Where we are processing personal information based on contract, we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">(d) Legal Obligation. Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfil the legal obligation. Long-term storage within the TODAY platform may particularly arise from legal obligations, including those from the tax code and the Insurance Contract Act (VVG). The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">(e) Legal Claim. We may need to apply a “legal hold” that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">(f) Contact information – if you have an account with us, we retain this for as long as you have an account on our services, and for 60 days after you close your account.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">(g) Uploaded Conversation data - We will delete uploaded conversation recordings after 180 days.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">The duration of the storage of personal data is measured by the relevant statutory retention periods (e.g. from commercial law and tax law). After expiry of the respective period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted. If data is required for the fulfilment or initiation of a contract or if we have a legitimate interest in continuing to store it, the data will be deleted when it is no longer required for these purposes or you have exercised your right of revocation or objection.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-101f1br" data-styles-preset="YJUvxCZHN">TODAY cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, technical and organisational measures designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%.
