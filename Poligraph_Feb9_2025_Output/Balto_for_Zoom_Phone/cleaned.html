<p>Balto Software, Inc. (“Balto”) provides cloud-based, AI-powered software that provides real-time guidance to contact centers.&nbsp; In this Privacy Notice we refer to the Balto hosted software and the suite of services provided through the hosted software as the “Balto Solution.” We maintain websites to market the Balto Solution at www.balto.ai and other websites controlled by us (collectively, the “Website”).</p>



<p>The Balto Solution is a business-to-business solution offered in the United States. We license the Balto Solution to entities that operate call centers (our “Clients”).&nbsp; Clients can access our Solution through our website at&nbsp;<a href="https://baltocloud.com/">https://baltocloud.com</a>. “Authorized Users” are persons who work for a Client and are authorized to access the Balto Solution on behalf of the Client.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balto knows you care about how your personal information is used and disclosed and your privacy is a top priority for us.&nbsp; We gather information about persons who interact with our Website and the Balto Solution, people who attend our marketing events, and job candidates to enhance our business. Our Privacy Notice helps you understand what information we collect and receive and how we use it and the choices you have. This Privacy Notice does not cover the practices of companies we don’t own or control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please read this Privacy Notice carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Website, purchase our goods or services, provide us with your personal information, or otherwise interact with us. By accessing or using this Website, providing us with your personal information, purchasing our goods or services, or otherwise interacting with us, you agree to this Privacy Notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As described herein, this Privacy Notice may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Website, our products or services, provision of your personal information, or other interactions with us after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Notice periodically for updates.</p>



<p>In this Privacy Notice personal information or “PI” means information that identifies, relates to or describes a particular person and information that is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are four sections to this Privacy Notice:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>PI we collect and why we collect it.</li>



<li>How we disclose PI and why we disclose it.</li>



<li>How we use online tracking technologies including cookies.</li>



<li>General concepts that apply to the PI we collect or receive.</li>
</ol>



<p class="has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color"><strong>1. PI we collect and why we collect it.</strong></p>



<p><em>The Balto Solution.</em>  The Balto Solution will provide Balto with information related to call center calls of Balto’s Clients.  The specific types of information, including PI, provided are determined by the way the related Client has configured and uses the Balto Solution and are outside of Balto’s control. PI may be contained in the content of communications Client or its Authorized Users generate using the Balto Solution and Balto does not and cannot control the content of such communications when generated. When Balto processes any such content, Balto is as a processor or service provider acting on behalf of Client. Further, Balto limits its use of personal information to the minimum required to provide and improve the Balto Solution. For example, if you are an Authorized User then you have the option of enabling call center call audio recording or transcription, or both. When you do so, Balto captures and stores call center audio recordings and transcriptions in order to provide the Balto Solution, By default, the Balto Solution is structured to exclude any content from call center audio recordings and transcriptions that is personal information through a rigorous redaction and scrubbing process that begins as soon as the information is generated. However, subject to due diligence, certain Clients may be allowed to change this default setting so that the Balto Solution will store an unredacted version of call center audio recordings and transcriptions for review by the Client’s Authorized Users. Depending on the PI involved, Balto may require the Client to store such unredacted call center audio recordings and transcriptions outside of the Balto Solution.</p>

<p>Like many website owners, Balto and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use automated data collection tools such as cookies and similar technologies to collect certain information, in order to, among other things, analyze trends, administer the Website, tracking users’ movements around the Website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>



<p>“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a website’s computers. We may use session Cookies, persistent Cookies, and Web Beacons (defined below). We use Cookies to identify that you’ve accessed the Website. We also use these tracking technologies to help us better understand your behavior and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of our Website.</p>



<p>We also use small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) (“Web Beacons”)to collect information about your engagement with us.

<p>Here is a description of the types of cookies Balto uses:</p>



<p><em>Required cookies.</em> Required cookies, including session cookies, make it possible for you to access the Website, navigate within the Website, and access information related to your account. Required cookies are necessary to operate the Website, so you can’t opt-out of them.</p>

<p class="has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color"><strong>4. General. This section outlines general concepts that apply to the PI we collect or receive.</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How we secure your PI.</li>
</ul>



<p>Balto uses appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to protect your PI, both online and offline. These measures vary based on the nature of the PI.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or data storage system is guaranteed to be 100% secure. You should only access the Website and Balto Solution within a secure environment. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below.</p>



<ul start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data Transfers.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our data centers are located in the United States. If you visit our Website or use the Balto Solution or otherwise provide PI to us then your PI will be processed and stored in the United States, which may provide a different level of data security than in your country of residence. In some cases which we describe above, Balto may disclose your PI to its data subprocessors such as its cloud hosting provider.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Text Messaging Terms</li>
</ul>



<p>By providing Balto your phone number or otherwise providing your consent to receive marketing text messages from Balto, you agree and authorize Balto (and entities or individuals working on Balto’s behalf) to deliver or cause to be delivered advertisements or telemarketing messages via text message to you, including through an automatic telephone dialing system at the phone number you provided to Balto. You are not required to provide such authorization as a condition of purchasing any property, goods, or services from Balto. You further understand and agree you are electronically signing the above authorization, which will have the same force and effect as a manual signature, and consent to provide such authorization by electronic means. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies. You can opt out of receiving text message at any time by texting “STOP”. To submit a request to opt-out, you can also contact us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below. This type of opt out does not apply to information provided to Balto as a result of a product purchase, product service experience, or other transactions.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>PI of Children</li>
</ul>



<p>The Website and Balto Solution are not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18). We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under age 18. If you are under 18, do not use or provide any information on the Website or on or through any of its features/register on the Website or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. If we discover that we have collected PI of individuals under age 18, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about an individual under 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@balto.ai"><strong>privacy@balto.ai</strong></a>.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data Protection Rights</li>
