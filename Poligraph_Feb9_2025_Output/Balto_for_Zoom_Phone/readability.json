PI we collect and why we collect it.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Balto Solution.</em>  The Balto Solution will provide Balto with information related to call center calls of Balto\u2019s Clients.  The specific types of information, including PI, provided are determined by the way the related Client has configured and uses the Balto Solution and are outside of Balto\u2019s control. PI may be contained in the content of communications Client or its Authorized Users generate using the Balto Solution and Balto does not and cannot control the content of such communications when generated. When Balto processes any such content, Balto is as a processor or service provider acting on behalf of Client. Further, Balto limits its use of personal information to the minimum required to provide and improve the Balto Solution. For example, if you are an Authorized User then you have the option of enabling call center call audio recording or transcription, or both. When you do so, Balto captures and stores call center audio recordings and transcriptions in order to provide the Balto Solution, By default, the Balto Solution is structured to exclude any content from call center audio recordings and transcriptions that is personal information through a rigorous redaction and scrubbing process that begins as soon as the information is generated. However, subject to due diligence, certain Clients may be allowed to change this default setting so that the Balto Solution will store an unredacted version of call center audio recordings and transcriptions for review by the Client\u2019s Authorized Users. Depending on the PI involved, Balto may require the Client to store such unredacted call center audio recordings and transcriptions outside of the Balto Solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>WHAT PI WE COLLECT</strong></td><td><strong>WHY WE COLLECT THIS PI</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>PI that you provide voluntarily</strong><p>We may ask you to provide PI voluntarily on parts of our Website, if you attend our marketing events or webinars, if you inquire about licensing the Balto Solution or if you apply for a job with us.</p><p>The types of PI we ask you to provide may include, as applicable, your first and last name, your contact details (phone number, email address and mailing address), employer and job title.</p></td><td>We collect this PI for these business purposes:<p>\u2013 to send you direct marketing materials about the Balto Solution including marketing offers and resources, emails, text messages, newsletters, and company updates,</p><p>\u2013 to personalize the marketing emails or text messages we send you so they are more relevant to you, based on your Website interactions or other interactions with us,</p><p>\u2013 to respond to sales inquiries, demo requests and technical support questions you submit about the Balto Solution,</p><p>\u2013 to communicate with you about job opportunities with us, and</p><p>\u2013 to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>PI that you provide voluntarily (cont\u2019d)</strong><p>If you are an Authorized User and access the Balto Solution, then you must provide an account login ID (such as your real name or a user name you create yourself), and a valid work or SSO email address to create a user account.

General. This section outlines general concepts that apply to the PI we collect or receive.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How we secure your PI.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Balto uses appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to protect your PI, both online and offline. These measures vary based on the nature of the PI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or data storage system is guaranteed to be 100% secure. You should only access the Website and Balto Solution within a secure environment. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the \u201cContact Us\u201d section below.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul start=\"2\">\n<li>Data Transfers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our data centers are located in the United States. If you visit our Website or use the Balto Solution or otherwise provide PI to us then your PI will be processed and stored in the United States, which may provide a different level of data security than in your country of residence. In some cases which we describe above, Balto may disclose your PI to its data subprocessors such as its cloud hosting provider.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Text Messaging Terms</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By providing Balto your phone number or otherwise providing your consent to receive marketing text messages from Balto, you agree and authorize Balto (and entities or individuals working on Balto\u2019s behalf) to deliver or cause to be delivered advertisements or telemarketing messages via text message to you, including through an automatic telephone dialing system at the phone number you provided to Balto. You are not required to provide such authorization as a condition of purchasing any property, goods, or services from Balto. You further understand and agree you are electronically signing the above authorization, which will have the same force and effect as a manual signature, and consent to provide such authorization by electronic means. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies. You can opt out of receiving text message at any time by texting \u201cSTOP\u201d. To submit a request to opt-out, you can also contact us in accordance with the \u201cContact Us\u201d section below.

We will use this information to verify your request is a permitted request, such as by matching your name and address with information in our records. Depending on the type of request, we may require a certain number of data points to allow for verification. Once we have verified you, we will respond and comply with your specific requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only you, or a person properly authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your personal information. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may require the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit the request. We may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we deny your request, you may have the right to appeal our decision.

Once given, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not Sell personal information, as \u201cSell\u201d is defined under the CCPA and similar U.S. state privacy laws.

However, as discussed above, the specific types of information, including PI, provided within the Balto Solution are determined by the Client and are outside of Balto\u2019s control.

The specific types of information, including PI, provided are determined by the way the related Client has configured and uses the Balto Solution and are outside of Balto\u2019s control. PI may be contained in the content of communications Client or its Authorized Users generate using the Balto Solution and Balto does not and cannot control the content of such communications when generated. When Balto processes any such content, Balto is as a processor or service provider acting on behalf of Client. Further, Balto limits its use of personal information to the minimum required to provide and improve the Balto Solution. For example, if you are an Authorized User then you have the option of enabling call center call audio recording or transcription, or both. When you do so, Balto captures and stores call center audio recordings and transcriptions in order to provide the Balto Solution, By default, the Balto Solution is structured to exclude any content from call center audio recordings and transcriptions that is personal information through a rigorous redaction and scrubbing process that begins as soon as the information is generated. However, subject to due diligence, certain Clients may be allowed to change this default setting so that the Balto Solution will store an unredacted version of call center audio recordings and transcriptions for review by the Client\u2019s Authorized Users. Depending on the PI involved, Balto may require the Client to store such unredacted call center audio recordings and transcriptions outside of the Balto Solution.\n\n\n\nWHAT PI WE COLLECTWHY WE COLLECT THIS PIPI that you provide voluntarilyWe may ask you to provide PI voluntarily on parts of our Website, if you attend our marketing events or webinars, if you inquire about licensing the Balto Solution or if you apply for a job with us.The types of PI we ask you to provide may include, as applicable, your first and last name, your contact details (phone number, email address and mailing address), employer and job title.We collect this PI for these business purposes:\u2013 to send you direct marketing materials about the Balto Solution including marketing offers and resources, emails, text messages, newsletters, and company updates,\u2013 to personalize the marketing emails or text messages we send you so they are more relevant to you, based on your Website interactions or other interactions with us,\u2013 to respond to sales inquiries, demo requests and technical support questions you submit about the Balto Solution,\u2013 to communicate with you about job opportunities with us, and\u2013 to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.PI that you provide voluntarily (cont\u2019d)If you are an Authorized User and access the Balto Solution, then you must provide an account login ID (such as your real name or a user name you create yourself), and a valid work or SSO email address to create a user account.

These measures vary based on the nature of the PI.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or data storage system is guaranteed to be 100% secure.
