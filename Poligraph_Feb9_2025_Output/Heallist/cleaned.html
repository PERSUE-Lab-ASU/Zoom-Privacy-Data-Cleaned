This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and disclose personal information of the users of our Service, including practitioners who use the Service to list their services and/or to offer treatment ("<strong>Practitioners</strong>") and customers who are interested in obtaining such services and/or treatments ("<strong>Customers</strong>"). By accessing or using our Site, Apps, or our Service, you agree that you have read and understood this PrivacyPolicy, so please review it carefully.</p><p><strong>1. HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p><p> When we use the term "personal information" we mean any information that can be used to identify you, directly or indirectly, as an individual person. &nbsp;We collect personal information in connection with your visits to and use of the Service. This collection includes information that you provide in connection with the Service, information from third parties, and information that is collected automatically, such as through the use of cookies and other technologies. </p><p>A. Information You Provide to Us Directly</p><p>•	If you create an account or a profile on our Service, we may collect your full name, phone number, email address, home or business address, state of residence, date of birth, gender, account credentials such as username and password, payment card information, licensure information, photos, videos, and we may display this information on your profile page and use it to provide you with our Service. &nbsp;</p><p>•	With your permission, Heallist may also access the contact lists available on your mobile device, your email accounts, or in other information systems you connect with the Service, in order to locate clients on the Service and to invite them to use our Service, and we may also integrate our Service with your calendar system (such as Google Calendar) in order to sync your calendar entries with your Heallist schedule.</p><p>•	If you contact us, we may collect your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, or any other personal information you provide to us, and use it to communicate with you, to enhance our Service, and to manage and grow our organization.</p><p>B. Information We Collect Automatically Through Your Use of the Service</p><p>•	Our web servers keep log files that record data every time a device accesses those servers. As such, when you access the Site, we will automatically collect information such as your browser type and version, device and connection information, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the Internet, and standard web log information. &nbsp;We may collect general geographic location based on your IP address or more precise geolocation with your permission when accessing our Service through a mobile device.<br>•	As our Service includes, among other features, a video calling/conferencing feature, either provided by us or through a third party, which transmits and which may capture screen activity, Heallist may inadvertently collect information while you use this feature. This information may include physical addresses, email address, phone number, information related to contacts, photos, videos, web browsing history and other information visible on your screen while using this feature, which could also include personal data about you and/or others including without limitation data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data, health data, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation. Heallist encourages all users to close out any information displayed on their screens before using the video calling/conferencing feature. To the extent personal data is captured during a session, it will be stored, secured and accessible only in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>•	We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Service, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, "tracking technologies"). For example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID (that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or your account), and other such information. We also collect information about the way you use our Service, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, and other actions you take on the Service. Most internet browsers allow you to remove or manage cookie functions and adjust your privacy and security preferences. For information on how to do this, access the ‘help’ menu on your internet browser, or access http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-control-cookies. Please note, however, that disabling our cookies may mean that you will not be able to take full advantage of the Service.</p><p>•	When you access our Service from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our Apps (including, for example, a UDID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data (with your permission), including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.</p><p>•	We may obtain information from other sources, including through third-party information providers or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. We may combine this information with other information we collect from or about you. In these cases, our Privacy Policy governs the handling of the combined personal information. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages about products and services that may be of interest to you. We may also collect information about you that is publicly available.</p><p>•	We may receive personal information about you from third parties and combine that with information we collect through our Service. For example, when you interact with us through a social media site or third-party service, such as when you like, follow, or share Heallist content on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other sites, we may receive information from the social network, including your profile information, picture, user ID associated with your social media account, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive from these third-party sites is dependent upon that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Service.</p><p>•	Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we are not able to respond to ‘Do Not Track’ signals from your browser at this time.</p><p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p><p>We use the information we collect for purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed to you on our Service or in connection with our Service.
