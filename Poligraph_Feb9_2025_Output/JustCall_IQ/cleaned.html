                                <p>We collect different types of information from or through the Service. The legal
                                    bases for JustCall's processing of Personal Data are primarily that the processing
                                    is necessary for providing the Service in accordance with our Terms of Service and
                                    that the processing is carried out in JustCall's legitimate interests, which are
                                    further explained in the section “How do we use your information?” of this Policy.
                                    We may also process data upon your consent, asking for it as appropriate.</p>

                                <p>When you use the Service, as a User or as a Visitor, you may provide, and we may
                                    collect Personal Data. Examples of Personal Data include name, email address, mobile
                                    phone number, and credit card or other billing information. Personal Data also
                                    includes other information, such as geographic area or preferences, when any such
                                    information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual. You may
                                    provide us with Personal Data in various ways on the Service. For example, when you
                                    register for an Account, use the Service, post Client Data, interact with other
                                    users of the Service through communication or messaging capabilities, or send us

                                    centralized databases and with service providers located in the US. The US may not
                                    have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using
                                    the Services. When we transfer Personal Data to the US, we will protect it as
                                    described in this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>

                                <p>The Service is hosted in the United States if you choose to use the service from the

                                    personal information from Europe to the US. Also, we may transfer your data to the

                                <p>JustCall does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or
                                    processed by a Client or User via the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled
                                    to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. JustCall is largely
                                    unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client
                                    or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as
                                    authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its
                                    Users.</p>

                                <p>Because JustCall does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained
                                    in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such
                                    Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses
                                    of such Personal Data, JustCall is not acting in the capacity of data controller in
                                    terms of the European-Union's General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)
                                    2016/679, "GDPR") and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR.
                                    JustCall should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users
                                    as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements
                                    of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, JustCall does not
                                    independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with
                                    the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except
                                    to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of JustCall in
                                    connection with JustCall's provision of Services to Clients. Such actions are
                                    performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.</p>

                                <p>The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client
                                    Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such
                                    Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and
                                    means of the processing of such Personal Data.</p>

                                <p>JustCall is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the
                                    Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors'
                                    servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is JustCall responsible for the
                                    manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or

                                <p>We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User's
                                    account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to
                                    fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise
                                    required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our

                                    interact with one of their advertisements on the Site; and (2) advertising networks,

                                <h4 style="color:#003BB3;padding-bottom:36px;">Fair Information Practices</h4>

                                <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
                                    United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the
                                    development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
                                    Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
                                    comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information</p>

                                <p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
                                        following responsive action, should a data breach occur</strong>: We will notify
                                    you via email or via in-site notification whitin 7 business days. We also agree to
                                    the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
                                    legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to
                                    adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
                                    enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
                                    courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
                                    processors.</p>
