  - Depending on how you interact with us, we gather various information from different
    sources.
  - During your participation in the Scout Insider Beta Testing Program, we may collect
    various types of data, including but not limited to, usage patterns, GPS location,
    driving behavior, system events, and feedback you provide regarding the software
    and services.
  - For example, we may collect demographic and marketing data about you from third
    parties for marketing research and analysis to improve our products/services,
    obtain updated address information from our shippers, or collect information from
    other vendors that promote and distribute our products through their own brands.
  - Please note that for the Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) feature, we may share
    data with the original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") of the vehicle.
  - 'Specifically, when you use the Telenav Software on connected vehicles to search
    for a point of interest or an address, or to create a route, we receive and store
    the following information: (i) a unique hashed identifier assigned by the vehicle
    manufacturer (e.g., BYD or Chang''An); (ii) your current GPS location, planned
    route, and destination information; (iii) your search requests for addresses or
    points of interest and the search results you select; and (iv) information about
    your use of the location and routing search service, including its performance
    and your related actions and selections.'
  - This data is used to provide you with accurate navigation and search services,
    including real-time traffic flow data and responses to requests for nearby points
    of interest, such as gas stations, restaurants, and shopping centers.
  - We collect data during the beta testing phase to evaluate the performance of the
    software, understand how users interact with the features, and assess the potential
    effectiveness of future insurance products.
  - We keep all information collected confidential and will only use the information
    for the particular purpose for which it was originally collected.
  - We may also collect Personal Data and Other Information that you voluntarily provide.
  - We may also use this information to enhance our products and services, improve
    map coverage, and develop new features that enrich your user experience.
  - We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any
    of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information
    to establish or exercise yours, ours, or others' legal rights, or to defend against
    legal claims.
  - When you access, use, register on and/or fill out a form (e.g., Request a Demo)
    on one of our Telenav websites (including telenav.com , scoutgps.com , scoutgpslink.com
    , skobbler.com , skobbler.de or chatbaka.com ), or register for services using
    the Telenav Platform, we collect data from you in several ways.
  - When you request information about our products or services, either from the Telenav
    Platform or from one of our partners through which we may offer our products or
    services, such as a mobile telecommunications provider, we collect information
    such as your name, nicknames, phone number, and email address, and, if you are
