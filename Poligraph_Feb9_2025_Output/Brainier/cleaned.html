<p><strong>Information from Cookies, Scripts, and Related Automated Technologies:</strong></p>
<p>We and third-party partners use various automated data collection technologies, which may include “cookies,” scripts, pixel tags, or similar technology, to gather information about users of our Services – such as pages visited and how often they are visited – and to enable certain features on the Services. “Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website or click on a URL.</p>
<p>While the automated data collection technologies we use may change from time to time, they generally fall into one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Necessary cookies.</em></strong>These cookies are necessary for you to use the services, load and view content, and access your account.</li>
<li><strong><em>Functionality cookies.</em></strong>These cookies help us remember you and personalize features and content for you on the Services.</li>
<li><strong><em>Advertisement cookies.</em></strong>These cookies allow us to better understand your interests and to place advertisements on our or other websites, measure their effectiveness, and personalize their content to you. These cookies may collect information about your online activities over time and across websites.</li>
<li><strong><em>Analytics cookies.</em></strong>These cookies help us compile statistics and analytics about users, including traffic, usage, and trend data, which enable us to understand how users engage with the Website. For example, we use Google Analytics to understand how our Services are used.

Please be aware that disabling cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of certain features on the Services.</p>
<p><u>Do Not Track Policy:</u><br>
Some browsers have “Do Not Track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. As these features are not all uniform and no accepted standard for how such signals should be interpreted, we do not currently respond to those signals.</p>

If we have sent you a promotional email, you may send us a return email asking to be omitted from future email distributions.</li>
<li><strong>Updating, Correcting, and Deleting Data. </strong>We provide an individual who has submitted information in their profile on the Website with the ability to review, correct, and request the deletion of the information that was entered in their profile.
