If you require any further information about how we use your personal information, please let us know.</li>\n<li><strong>Request </strong><strong>access</strong><strong> </strong>to your personal information (commonly known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Request </strong><strong>correction</strong><strong> </strong>of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>\n<li><strong>Request erasure </strong>of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it (for instance, we may need to continue using your personal data to comply with our legal obligations). You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>\n<li><strong>Object</strong><strong> to processing </strong>of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to us using your information on this basis and we do not have a compelling legitimate basis for doing so which overrides your rights, interests and freedoms (for instance, we may need it to defend a legal claim). You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>\n<li><strong>Request</strong><strong> the restriction of processing </strong>of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Request</strong><strong> the transfer </strong>of your personal information to another party where you provided it to us and we are using it based on your consent, or to carry out a contract with you, and we process it using automated means.</li>\n<li><strong>Withdraw consent.</strong> In the limited circumstances where we are relying on your consent (as opposed to the other bases set out above) to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate interest in doing so.</li>\n<li><strong>Lodge a complaint</strong>. If you think that we are using your information in a way which breaches data protection law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection supervisory authority (if you are in the UK, this will be the ICO).\n<p>If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please email <a href=\"mailto:customercare@paprika-software.com\">customercare@paprika-software.com</a>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>No fee usually required. </strong>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</li>\n<li><strong>What we may need from you. </strong>We may need to request specific information from you to help us understand the nature of your request, to confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</li>\n<li><strong>Timescale. </strong>Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We will respond to your request as soon as we can.

You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.\nRequest the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.\nRequest the transfer of your personal information to another party where you provided it to us and we are using it based on your consent, or to carry out a contract with you, and we process it using automated means.\nWithdraw consent.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us understand the nature of your request, to confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights).
