In those instances PublicInput.com is only processing those responses on behalf of the Partner.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PublicInput.com uses data in the ways described below, for legitimate interests pursued by it which are described in this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The data impacted by this section includes:\n<ul>\n<li>Survey type, question type and responses (at an aggregated and anonymized level only);</li>\n<li>Device data</li>\n<li>Log data</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>PublicInput.com will use automated processes and machine learning, to analyze survey responses, which in turn helps us to:\n<ul>\n<li>Aggregate response data and activity: We will aggregate responses, activity and behavior of Respondents so that we can identify trends, build product features that optimize responses, and help Partners improve response rates.</li>\n<li>Extract and analyze usage patterns: By understanding response data and Respondent interaction in different types of surveys we can:\n<ul>\n<li>improve our services and ease of use: for example, we might identify when respondents prefer multiple choice versus open text questions and make predictive response suggestions when certain question types are selected. We might also use this data to help improve analysis of responses,</li>\n<li>undertake personalization for survey Partners and Respondents (for example by customizing the page on our website which a Respondent sees at the end of a survey),</li>\n<li>improve user experience (for example, by collecting and using device and browser information from Respondents to improve how our survey service operates on those devices and in those browsers), and</li>\n<li>identify insightful data trends (which never identifies any individuals).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We process personal data about you where:\n<ul>\n<li>You have consented or;</li>\n<li>PublicInput.com has legitimate interests of improving service experience and developing new products and service features.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Partner and Respondent trust is paramount to everything we do and so when we do use data about Respondents, we put Partners and Respondents first.
