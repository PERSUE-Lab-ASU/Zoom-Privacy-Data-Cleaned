This is a cloud communications platform as a service (CPaaS) which allows to make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs. Twilio hosts telephony infrastructure and provides connectivity between HTTP and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) through its APIs. Our platform can use its own Twilio account (with per-client dedicated numbers) but also allows clients to connect their own Twilio accounts. Separate Twilio numbers can be used for an entire company (all recruiters and communication) and personalized numbers for each recruiter. We have integrated Twilio in our App with the following functionality:&nbsp;</span></p>\n                                                                </li>\n                                                                <ul>\n                                                                    <li>\n                                                                        <p><span>Messaging.

Our App is using Twilio Voice API for voice calls (CallTran) functionality. Clients can initiate calls to Applicants from the application. Voice calls are being recorded and transcribed. Transcribe log is added to the Inbox chat as in a form of text messages (separately from the Applicant and from the recruiter). Call records are available for Clients as mp3 files for downloading.</span></p>\n                                                                    </li>\n                                                                    <li>\n                                                                        <p><span>Video calls. The App is using Twilio Video for video calls. Video calls are also being recorded and available for Clients in mp4 files. A recruiter can initiate a call and if the Applicant accepts it, then a video room is created, participants are joined and can talk to each other. Applicants have to allow access to their cameras and microphones for this feature to work.</span></p>\n                                                                    </li>\n                                                                </ul>\n                                                                <li>\n                                                                    <p><span>Microsoft Azure.

If a candidate chooses to use messaging applications, then his personal data are processed by these messaging applications (or telecommunication operators in case of SMS service) which provide internet connectivity required by the messaging applications. Presently, XORbots can be used with the following messaging applications:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                                                        SMS\n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                        Viber\n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                        Telegram\n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                        WhatsApp\u00a0\n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                        Facebook Messenger\n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                        Avito Messenger\n                                                                    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                    Twilio. This is a cloud communications platform as a service (CPaaS) which allows to make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs. Twilio hosts telephony infrastructure and provides connectivity between HTTP and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) through its APIs. Our platform can use its own Twilio account (with per-client dedicated numbers) but also allows clients to connect their own Twilio accounts. Separate Twilio numbers can be used for an entire company (all recruiters and communication) and personalized numbers for each recruiter. We have integrated Twilio in our App with the following functionality:\u00a0\n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                                                        Messaging.

Our App is using Twilio Voice API for voice calls (CallTran) functionality. Clients can initiate calls to Applicants from the application. Voice calls are being recorded and transcribed. Transcribe log is added to the Inbox chat as in a form of text messages (separately from the Applicant and from the recruiter). Call records are available for Clients as mp3 files for downloading.\n                                                                    \n                                                                    \n                                                                        Video calls. The App is using Twilio Video for video calls. Video calls are also being recorded and available for Clients in mp4 files. A recruiter can initiate a call and if the Applicant accepts it, then a video room is created, participants are joined and can talk to each other. Applicants have to allow access to their cameras and microphones for this feature to work.\n                                                                    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                    Microsoft Azure.

If we transfer personal data to a third country, it shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of GDPR, the conditions laid down in Chapter V of GDPR are complied with by the Company or other third parties in their capacity of processors, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an international organization to another third country or to another international organization.\n                                                            Obligatory contracts for onward transfers\n                                                            In cases when personal data are transferred from the EU or Switzerland to outside the EU or Switzerland only for processing purposes, we, in our capacity of data processor, conclude contracts, regardless of our participation in the Privacy Shield.

The Privacy Shield organization must enter into a contract with the recipient third-party controller that provides for the same level of protection as is available under the Privacy Shield, not including the requirement that the third-party controller be a Privacy Shield organization or have an independent recourse mechanism, provided it makes available an equivalent mechanism.\n                                                            Following the CJEU\u2019s judgement in the Schrems II case (C-311/18), we rely upon standard contractual clauses for transfers to third countries and all contracts we sign with Clients and subcontractors include standard contractual clauses as appendix. If you are a Client of ours and have signed a contract with us before the CJEU\u2019s judgement in the Schrems II case was issued, then by accepting the present Privacy Policy, you also accept the terms of the standard contractual clauses. If a Client does not accept the standard contractual clauses, the Client must quit using our Services and let us know by e-mail. The standard contractual clauses are available to all Clients upon e-mail request sent to us.\n                                                            Limiting the use and disclosure of personal

transferred to the US to decide, by either opt-in or opt-out, as may be required by relevant local laws, rules or regulations (including, the Privacy Shield Principles), whether their personal data may be disclosed to a third-party that is not an agent or used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by that
