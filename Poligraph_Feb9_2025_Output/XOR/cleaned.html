This is a cloud communications platform as a service (CPaaS) which allows to make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs. Twilio hosts telephony infrastructure and provides connectivity between HTTP and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) through its APIs. Our platform can use its own Twilio account (with per-client dedicated numbers) but also allows clients to connect their own Twilio accounts. Separate Twilio numbers can be used for an entire company (all recruiters and communication) and personalized numbers for each recruiter. We have integrated Twilio in our App with the following functionality:&nbsp;</span></p>
