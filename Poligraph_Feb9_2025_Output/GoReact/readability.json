Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Service.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cookies and other technologies</em></strong>. We use technologies like&nbsp;cookies and pixel tags&nbsp;to provide, improve, protect and promote our Service. For example, cookies and other technologies help us with things like remembering your username and preferences for your next visit, understanding how you interact with our Service including things like clicks, mouse actions, text entered, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and other related information, and then improving the Service based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this will limit your ability to use the Service.&nbsp;We obtain your consent for use of cookies.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Video information</em></strong>.&nbsp; You may sometimes use the Service in connection with your participation in an activity in which your image, words, or actions are recorded by the Service.
