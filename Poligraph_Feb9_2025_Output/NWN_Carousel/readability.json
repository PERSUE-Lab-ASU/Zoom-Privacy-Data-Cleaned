If we combine Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated as PII for as long as it remains combined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PII refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>PII Collected Through Website.</span> The PII we collect through our Website generally relates to your identity and contact information, such as, your name, company name, job title, company address, e-mail address and phone number. We may request PII when you register on the Website, purchase or utilize Services that we offer, or when you request or receive information regarding our Services. We collect PII only when you voluntarily provide it to us so if you do not want us to use or collect this information, please do not provide us with it. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to use or access certain content on our Website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>PII Collected Through Services</span>.&nbsp;The PII we collect through your use of our Services generally relates to your identity and contact information, such as, your name, company name, job title, company address, e-mail address and phone number. Our processing of this information is subject to agreements NWN Carousel has with our Clients, who control whether and to what extent our Services process your PII.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-PII refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. The Non-PII we collect when you visit our Website may include the Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d) of the Web site that you came from before visiting our Website, which pages you visit on our Website, which URL you go to next, which browser you used to come to our Website, your Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address, your device ID, and any search terms entered on our Website. Our Website may automatically collect Non- PII, including the web page from which a visitor enters our Website, which pages a visitor visits on our Website, and how much time a visitor spends on each page, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Passwords</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to certain parts of our Website requires a username and password, including the Experience Management Platform. A username and password permit us to track certain information, such as software license operations. You are responsible for any action connected with the use of your password, and you should not share your password with anyone. To request a new password, please follow the instructions on the relevant Website login page. NWN Carousel customers with a current maintenance agreement may request customer support via our Website. For customer support, a customer will generally be required to submit his/her name, Organization ID and contact information, such as phone number, email address and/or facsimile number.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2-cookies\">2. <strong>Cookies</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that your internet browser places on your device so that it can be recognized when it returns in the future.
