<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-how-we-collect-information-about-you">1. <strong></strong><strong>How We Collect Information About You</strong></h3>



<p>The information we collect through your use of our Website and Services generally falls into two categories: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”). If we combine Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated as PII for as long as it remains combined.</p>



<p><strong><em>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</em></strong></p>



<p>PII refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PII Collected Through Website.</span> The PII we collect through our Website generally relates to your identity and contact information, such as, your name, company name, job title, company address, e-mail address and phone number. We may request PII when you register on the Website, purchase or utilize Services that we offer, or when you request or receive information regarding our Services. We collect PII only when you voluntarily provide it to us so if you do not want us to use or collect this information, please do not provide us with it. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to use or access certain content on our Website.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PII Collected Through Services</span>.&nbsp;The PII we collect through your use of our Services generally relates to your identity and contact information, such as, your name, company name, job title, company address, e-mail address and phone number. Our processing of this information is subject to agreements NWN Carousel has with our Clients, who control whether and to what extent our Services process your PII.</p>



<p><strong><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)</em></strong></p>



<p>Non-PII refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. The Non-PII we collect when you visit our Website may include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the Web site that you came from before visiting our Website, which pages you visit on our Website, which URL you go to next, which browser you used to come to our Website, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your device ID, and any search terms entered on our Website. Our Website may automatically collect Non- PII, including the web page from which a visitor enters our Website, which pages a visitor visits on our Website, and how much time a visitor spends on each page, etc.</p>



<p><strong><em>Passwords</em></strong></p>



<p>Access to certain parts of our Website requires a username and password, including the Experience Management Platform. A username and password permit us to track certain information, such as software license operations. You are responsible for any action connected with the use of your password, and you should not share your password with anyone. To request a new password, please follow the instructions on the relevant Website login page. NWN Carousel customers with a current maintenance agreement may request customer support via our Website. For customer support, a customer will generally be required to submit his/her name, Organization ID and contact information, such as phone number, email address and/or facsimile number.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-cookies">2. <strong>Cookies</strong></h3>

<p>Some of the most common cookies, along with their primary purposes, that we use on our Website are listed below:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Google Analytics (_ga, _gid)</span>. In order to market to anonymous visitors, we use Google Analytics to support digital advertising using data collected from Website visitors as they anonymously browse the Websites. We use the data from Google Analytics to ensure that our marketing is targeting the appropriate Website visitors. Website visitors may use the Ads Settings to opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads by going to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190717211308/https:/www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>.&nbsp;Google Analytics’ currently available opt outs are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190717211308/https:/tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.</a>&nbsp;Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics Cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the Double Click cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Websites.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TechTarget (TS01fac3f6)</span>. TechTarget cookies may be used to build a profile of your interests in order to show you advertisements that may be relevant to you on other sites.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LinkedIn Insight Tag</span>. The LinkedIn Insight Tag is a piece of lightweight JavaScript code that we have added to our websites to enable in-depth campaign reporting and to help us unlock valuable insights about our website visitors. We use the LinkedIn Insight Tag to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and unlock additional insights about members interacting with our LinkedIn adverts.</p>



<p>The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of metadata such as IP address information, timestamp, and events such as page views. All data is encrypted and retained for 180 days. The LinkedIn browser cookie is stored in a visitor’s browser until they delete the cookie or the cookie expires (there’s a rolling six-month expiration from the last time the visitor’s browser loaded the Insight Tag).</p>



<p>You can opt out of cookies from LinkedIn on your LinkedIn settings page&nbsp;and recommend you read their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy" target="_blank">Cookie Policy&nbsp;</a>for more information.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demandbase Cookie</span> (<a href="https://support.demandbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000463206-FAQs-Cookie-based-identification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://support.demandbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000463206-Cookie-based-identification-FAQs</a>).

<p><strong><em>The Lawful Basis for Processing European Personal Information</em></strong></p>

We do not disclose your contact information to third-parties for their marketing purposes. When we collect information about you through your use of our Services, the lawful basis on which we process your personal information is because it is necessary to perform contractual obligations to you or our 4847-0956-7946.1 Clients (i.e. processing the data is necessary in order for us to provide you or our Clients with Services). In addition, we may process your personal information in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-how-we-protect-your-information">4. <strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></h3>



<p>We use reasonable, standard industry technological and physical safeguards to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Transactions, access to transactional records, or access to account information occurs over a server that has safeguards such as secure server software (SSL) which encrypts information before transmission. You can confirm that pages are encrypted, and we urge you to do so before submitting or transmitting sensitive information, by viewing the lock icon on the bottom of most browsers. However, no safeguards are infallible.</p>
