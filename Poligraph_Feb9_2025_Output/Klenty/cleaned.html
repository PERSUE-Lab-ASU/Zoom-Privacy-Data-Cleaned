          </p>
          <h4>LEGAL BASIS</h4>
          <p>
            The legal bases for Klenty’s processing of personal data are
            primarily that the processing is necessary for providing the Service
            in accordance with Klenty’s
            <a href="/terms-of-service" data-faitracker-click-bind="true">Terms of Service</a> and that the
            processing is carried out in Klenty’s legitimate interests, which
            are further explained in the section “How We Use the Information We
            Collect” of this Policy. We may also process data upon your consent,
            asking for it as appropriate.
          </p>
          <h3>II. WHAT INFORMATION DOES KLENTY COLLECT?</h3>
          <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
          <h4>A. Information You Provide to Us:</h4>
          <p>
            Your Personal Information: We receive and store any information you
            knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect Personal
            Information such as your name, email address, and browser
            information. You can choose not to provide us with certain
            information such as your credit card information, but then you may
            not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our
            features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Customers’ Personal Information: In order to provide you with
            the Services, we also receive and store any information you choose
            to provide us with respect to your customers (“Prospect” or
            “Prospects”). The Prospects information (“Prospects Information”) we
            receive and store typically includes names, phone numbers and email
            addresses of your customers, but will consist of any information you
            choose to provide us with. If you are using open, click tracking,
            Klenty collects the recipient’s activities (for example: opens,
            clicks, replies). Klenty has no direct relationship with the
            individuals whose Personal Data it hosts as part of Client Data.
            Each Client is responsible for providing notice to its customers and
            third persons concerning the purpose for which Client collects their
            Personal Data and how this Personal Data is processed in or through
            the Service as part of Client Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In keeping with standard online privacy practices, users should not
            include any highly sensitive information (such as social security
            numbers, financial information, or “protected health information”)
            in any emails so that such data does not transfer to our servers
            (even if only temporarily)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our
            site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We
            will automatically send your friend one or more emails inviting him
            or her to visit the site. Klenty stores this information for the
            sole purpose of sending this communication, and tracking the success
            of our referral program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your friend may contact us at <a data-faitracker-click-bind="true">support@Klenty.com</a> to request
            that we remove this information from our database.

            authorize an Integrated Service to provide Personal Data or other
            information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated

            Integrated Service makes available to us, including Prospects’s
            Personal Data, and other data such as email content and to use and
            disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your
            privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand what
            information that Integrated Service makes available to us, and make
            changes as appropriate. Please review each Integrated Service’s
            terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their
            services and connecting to our Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may provide us with credentials to access your email – this
            could be either by providing us with your username/ password (incase
            of SMTP / IMAP connections) or with Oauth Tokens, which permit us to

            copy of any emails that you receive from Prospects for the purposes
            of presenting the relevant information to you in Klenty.

            <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" data-faitracker-click-bind="true">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use Requirements.
          </p>
          <h4>B. Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
          <p>
            Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and
            record information on our server logs from your browser including
            your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested.
            “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile
            device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and
            tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited by you. You
            may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile
            device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of
            cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of
            our Website’s features. If you click on a link to a third party
            website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This
            Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third
            parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you visit the Website, whether as a Klenty customer or a
            non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record
            information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website
            (“Log Data”). For example, Log Data may include information such as
            your computer’s IP address, browser type or the webpage you were
            visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that
            you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for
            on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use
            this information to monitor and analyze use of the Website and the
            Services and for the Website’s technical administration, to increase
            our Website’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better
            tailor it to our visitors’ needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you
            to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services
            (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish
            such operators to track certain of your online activities over time
            and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not
            Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect
            information about your online activity both while you are using the
            Services and after you leave our Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, as part of our provision of the Services to you, if
            you install certain software code provided by us on your website, we
            will also track and collect Prospect usage information on your
            website. We also use third parties to collect publicly available
            information relating to your Prospects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google Workspace APIs are not used to develop, improve, or train generalized AI and/or ML models.
          </p>
          <h4>C. Third Party Analytics Services</h4>
          <p>
            We use third party analytics services in order to better understand
            user engagement with the Services. When a user browses or uses the
            Services, these third party analytics services may collect the
            user’s IP address, browser type, and approximate location (based on
            the IP address). They may also use web logs or web beacons and may
            set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In order to
            refine our understanding of user engagement, we provide these
            services with a user’s name and email address (which we collected as
            part of the user’s account registration process).
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of cookies by our tracking utilities is not covered by our
            privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
            Our tracking utilities use both session ID and persistent cookies to
            enable us to design a better experience for our customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our third party partners also employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
            Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage
            content on our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you browse Klenty and other websites, online ad networks we work
            with may place anonymous cookies on your computer, and use similar
            technologies, in order to understand your interests based on your
            (anonymous) online activities, and thus to tailor more relevant ads
            to you.
          </p>
          <h4>D. E-mail and Other Communications:</h4>
          <p>
            We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may

            still govern your use of the Website, and you are responsible for
            reviewing such legal notices for changes.

            A. Trusted Third Parties: We employ other companies and people to
            perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with
            them to provide the Services to you. Unless we tell you differently,
            such third parties do not have any right to use the Personal
            Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist
            us. This includes third party companies and individuals employed by
            us to facilitate our Services, including the provision of
            maintenance services, database management, Web analytics and general
            improvement of the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            B. Business Transfers: We may be involved in a reorganization,
            merger or sale of our assets. In these types of transactions,
            customer information is typically one of the business assets that is
            transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are
            acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go
            through some other change of control, Personal Information would be
            one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. You
            will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site
            of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as
            well as any choices you may have regarding your personal
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            C. Protection of Klenty and Others: We reserve the right to access,
            read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably
            believe is necessary to comply with law or a court order; enforce or
            apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the
            rights, property, or safety of Klenty, our employees, our users, or
            others. This includes exchanging information with other companies
            and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
          </p>
          <h3>VI. CAN KLENTY ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
          <p>
            We can access two types of information: personal (name, email
            address, company information) and general statistical information
            (average reply rates, open rates, click rates, the overall number of
            sent messages, the average number of emails per campaign etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            We may access your personal information for accounting/billing
            purposes (such as invoicing), updating (letting you know about
            recent changes to our Service), in case of breaking our
            <a href="/terms-of-service" data-faitracker-click-bind="true">Terms</a> (or suspicion of it), such as
            sending SPAM messages, prohibited content, or using inappropriate
            language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Customer Success team (support) may access your Klenty account
            upon your request in order to answer specific questions related to
            the Service or solving some problems you’ve reported or which have
            been reported to us automatically by our system
          </p>
          <p>
            We may access your general statistical information from your Account
            for efficient and proactive customer support and for benchmarking
            purposes. We will only use this numerical information in order to:
            track the general progress of efficiency of our Service, diagnose
            potential problems with your email campaigns (low deliverability,
            low open rates, high bounce rates) and help you solve them as
            quickly as possible. We may use your statistical information to
            compute benchmarks – which can help all of our users understand how
            to use the Service more effectively.
          </p>
