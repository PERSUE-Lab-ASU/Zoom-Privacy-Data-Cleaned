They may also use web logs or web beacons and may\n            set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In order to\n            refine our understanding of user engagement, we provide these\n            services with a user\u2019s name and email address (which we collected as\n            part of the user\u2019s account registration process).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The use of cookies by our tracking utilities is not covered by our\n            privacy policy.

Our Services do not support Do Not\n            Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect\n            information about your online activity both while you are using the\n            Services and after you leave our Services.\n          \n          \n            Additionally, as part of our provision of the Services to you, if\n            you install certain software code provided by us on your website, we\n            will also track and collect Prospect usage information on your\n            website. We also use third parties to collect publicly available\n            information relating to your Prospects.\n          \n          \n            Google Workspace APIs are not used to develop, improve, or train generalized AI and/or ML models.\n          \n          C. Third Party Analytics Services\n          \n            We use third party analytics services in order to better understand\n            user engagement with the Services. When a user browses or uses the\n            Services, these third party analytics services may collect the\n            user\u2019s IP address, browser type, and approximate location (based on\n            the IP address). They may also use web logs or web beacons and may\n            set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In order to\n            refine our understanding of user engagement, we provide these\n            services with a user\u2019s name and email address (which we collected as\n            part of the user\u2019s account registration process).\n          \n          \n            The use of cookies by our tracking utilities is not covered by our\n            privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.\n            Our tracking utilities use both session ID and persistent cookies to\n            enable us to design a better experience for our customers.\n          \n          \n            Our third party partners also employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web\n            Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage\n            content on our site.\n          \n          \n            As you browse Klenty and other websites, online ad networks we work\n            with may place anonymous cookies on your computer, and use similar\n            technologies, in order to understand your interests based on your\n            (anonymous) online activities, and thus to tailor more relevant ads\n            to you.\n          \n          D. E-mail and Other Communications:\n          \n            We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may\n            communicate with you about your use of the Website or Services.

Providing your information is crucial to set up an\n            account, process payment transactions and it\u2019s necessary for us to\n            provide you with the Service. Your information, whether public or\n            private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any\n            other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other\n            than for the purpose of delivering the Service and improving the\n            Service. In the event of breaking the\n            Terms of Service (such as sending\n            SPAM or other prohibited content defined in the\n            Terms of Service) it helps us\n            identify breach if terms more effectively.\n          \n          \n            Apart from the Service, we also collect your information to\n            personalize your experience with the Website, Blog and promotional\n            materials we distribute via social media platforms and\n            GoogleAdwords.\n          \n          IV. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\n          \n            The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and\n            stored and processed at, a destination in the United States or other\n            countries that we choose to use.

We will take all\n            steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is\n            treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

WILL KLENTY SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?\n          \n          \n            We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information or your\n            Prospects\u2019 Personal Information in personally identifiable form to\n            anyone. We share such Personal Information in personally\n            identifiable form with third parties as described below.\n          \n          \n            A. Trusted Third Parties: We employ other companies and people to\n            perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with\n            them to provide the Services to you. Unless we tell you differently,\n            such third parties do not have any right to use the Personal\n            Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist\n            us.

Business Transfers: We may be involved in a reorganization,\n            merger or sale of our assets. In these types of transactions,\n            customer information is typically one of the business assets that is\n            transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are\n            acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go\n            through some other change of control, Personal Information would be\n            one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. You\n            will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site\n            of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as\n            well as any choices you may have regarding your personal\n            information.\n          \n          \n            C.

This includes exchanging information with other companies\n            and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n          \n          VI. CAN KLENTY ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION\n          \n            We can access two types of information: personal (name, email\n            address, company information) and general statistical information\n            (average reply rates, open rates, click rates, the overall number of\n            sent messages, the average number of emails per campaign etc.).\n          \n          \n            We may access your personal information for accounting/billing\n            purposes (such as invoicing), updating (letting you know about\n            recent changes to our Service), in case of breaking our\n            Terms (or suspicion of it), such as\n            sending SPAM messages, prohibited content, or using inappropriate\n            language.\n          \n          \n            Our Customer Success team (support) may access your Klenty account\n            upon your request in order to answer specific questions related to\n            the Service or solving some problems you\u2019ve reported or which have\n            been reported to us automatically by our system\n          \n          \n            We may access your general statistical information from your Account\n            for efficient and proactive customer support and for benchmarking\n            purposes. We will only use this numerical information in order to:\n            track the general progress of efficiency of our Service, diagnose\n            potential problems with your email campaigns (low deliverability,\n            low open rates, high bounce rates) and help you solve them as\n            quickly as possible. We may use your statistical information to\n            compute benchmarks \u2013 which can help all of our users understand how\n            to use the Service more effectively.\n          \n          VII.
