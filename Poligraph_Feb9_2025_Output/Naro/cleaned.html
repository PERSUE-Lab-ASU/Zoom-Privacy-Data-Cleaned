In the ordinary course of providing these services, we may process personal data on behalf and at the direction of our enterprise customers. We are not the controllers of such personal data and our processing of such data is governed by the agreement in place between Naro and the applicable enterprise customer. The enterprise customer’s privacy policy or other agreement between the enterprise customer and you or your organization, and not this Privacy Policy, applies to such processing. If we process your personal data on behalf of one of our enterprise customers and you wish to&nbsp; discontinue such processing or otherwise exercise rights that may be available to you under applicable privacy laws, please contact the enterprise customer on whose behalf we are processing such data.</p><p>As we continually work to improve our Services, we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will alert you of material changes by placing a notice on the Naro website, by sending you an email and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>What this Privacy Policy Covers</strong></h4><p>This Privacy Policy covers how we treat Personal Data that we gather when you access or use our Services. “Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual and also includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” or “sensitive personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules or regulations.
