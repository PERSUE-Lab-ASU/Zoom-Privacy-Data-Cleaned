In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.</p><p>This policy is split into sections. For your convenience, links to each of those sections is as follows:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>What we collect and why</li><li>When we access or disclose your information</li><li>Your rights with respect to your information</li><li>How we secure your data</li><li>What happens when you delete content in your product accounts</li><li>Data retention</li><li>Location of site and data</li><li>Changes and questions</li></ul><p>This policy applies to all products built and maintained by AskElephant, Inc. including AskElephant (all versions), and associated products (together, \"AskElephant\"). If you are applying for a job at AskElephant, Inc., please review our Recruitment Privacy policy.</p><p>This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors, prospective customers, and customers and authorized users (in relation to their procurement of the services and management of their relationship with AskElephant, Inc.). We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as \"you\" throughout this policy.</p><p>However, this policy does not cover information about a customer's end users that AskElephant, Inc. receives from a customer, or otherwise processes on a customer's behalf, in connection with the services provided by AskElephant, Inc. to the customer pursuant to an applicable services agreement (including the content of messages of customer end users (\"End User Communications\")). AskElephant, Inc. processes End User Communications under the instructions of the relevant customer, which is the \"data controller\" or \"business\" (or occupies a similar role as defined in applicable privacy laws), as described in the applicable services agreement between such customer and AskElephant, Inc.. AskElephant, Inc.'s obligations as a \"data processor\" or \"service provider\" with respect to such information are defined in such services agreement and applicable data protection addendum and are not made part of this policy.</p><p>If you are a customer's end user and you have questions about how your information is collected and processed through the services, please contact the organization who has provided your information to us for more information.</p><p>\u200d</p><h2>What we collect and why</h2><p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:</p><h3>Identity and access</h3><p>When you sign up for an AskElephant, Inc. product, we ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and maybe a company name. That's so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you product updates and other essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you use our products and to make improvements. With your consent, we will send you our newsletter and other updates. We sometimes also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products.</p><p>We'll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.</p><h3>Billing information</h3><p>If you sign up for a paid AskElephant, Inc. product, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address. Credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn't hit AskElephant, Inc. servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address so we can charge you for service, calculate any sales tax due, send you invoices, and detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We occasionally use aggregate billing information to guide our marketing efforts.</p><h3>Product interactions</h3><p>We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in your AskElephant, Inc. product accounts. This is so you can use our products as intended, for example, to create projects in AskElephant or to receive email in associated products. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we'll delete the content within 60 days.</p><h3>General Geolocation data</h3><p>For most of our products, we log the full IP address used to sign up a product account and retain that for use in mitigating future spammy signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Access: You have the right to request copies of your personal information.</li><li>Rectification: You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.</li><li>Erasure: You have the right to request that we erase your personal information, under certain conditions.</li><li>Restriction of Processing: You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information, under certain conditions.</li><li>Object to Processing: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal information, under certain conditions.</li><li>Data Portability: You have the right to request that we transfer the information we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li></ul><h3>Website interactions</h3><p>We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they took to load, and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are signed in, these web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer active. The web analytics we use are described further in the Advertising and Cookies section.</p><h3>Advertising and Cookies</h3><p>AskElephant, Inc. runs contextual ads on various third-party platforms such as Google, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Users who click on one of our ads will be sent to the AskElephant marketing site. Where permissible under law, we may load an ad-company script on their browsers that sets a third-party cookie and sends information to the ad network to enable evaluation of the effectiveness of our ads, e.g., which ad they clicked and which keyword triggered the ad, and whether they performed certain actions such as clicking a button or submitting a form.</p><p>We also use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and perform A/B testing as well as support some analytics.</p><p>A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although our apps won't work and other aspects of our service may not function properly if you turn cookies off.</p><h3>Voluntary correspondence</h3><p>When you email AskElephant, Inc. with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future. We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so with your express consent.</p><p>\u200d</p><h2>How we approach mobile app permissions</h2><p>We offer optional desktop and mobile apps for some of our products. Because of how the platforms are designed, our apps typically must request your consent before accessing contacts, calendar, camera, and other privacy-sensitive features of your device. Consent is always optional and our apps will function without it, though some features may be unavailable. There are a few exceptions, for example: reference or use. We will only do so with your express consent.</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Our iOS apps will ask for permission to use push notifications upon first sign-in.</li><li>Android apps do not require permission to send push notifications.</li><li>For our AskElephant app on Android 5, the OS will prompt for permission upon installation to read and write to your device files so that you can select attachments from your device to upload to the app, and can download files from the app to your device.</li></ul><p>\u200d</p><h2>When we access or disclose your information</h2><h3>To provide products or services you've requested</h3><p>We use some third-party subprocessors to help run our applications and provide the Services to you. You can view the third-party subprocessors we use for each of our products: AskElephant, and associated products. We also use third-party processors for other business functions such as managing newsletter subscriptions, sending customer surveys, and providing our company storefront.</p><p>We may disclose your information at your direction if you integrate a third-party service into your use of our products. For example, we may allow you, at your option, to connect your Gmail account to your AskElephant account so that you can use AskElephant to receive and respond to your Gmail email. Email that you receive and respond to through AskElephant from your Gmail address will be stored by both AskElephant and Google and will be available to you from your Gmail account as well as your AskElephant account.</p><h3>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses</h3><p>We offer a 14-day free trial to new users who register with the Services. The account will not be charged and the subscription will be suspended until upgraded to a paid version at the end of the free trial.</p><p>\u200d</p><h2>Aggregated and de-identified data</h2><p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the services. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including marketing or analytics.</p><p>\u200d</p><h2>When required under applicable law</h2><p>AskElephant, Inc. is a U.S. company and all data infrastructure are located in the U.S.</p><p>\u200d</p><h2>Requests for user data</h2><p>Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to disclose data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is AskElephant, Inc.'s policy to notify affected users before we disclose data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.</p><p>\u200d</p><h2>Preservation requests</h2><p>Similarly, AskElephant, Inc.'s policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not disclose preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period..</p><p>If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to disclose billing-related information. If that happens, we will disclose only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.</p><p>Finally, if AskElephant, Inc. is acquired by or merges with another company \u2014 we don't plan on that, but if it happens \u2014 we'll notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p><p>\u200d</p><h2>Your rights with respect to your information</h2><p>At AskElephant, Inc., we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold.

In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li><li><strong>Right to Complain:</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.</li><li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of the sale of your personal information.

Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you.</p><p>In some cases, we also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests.
