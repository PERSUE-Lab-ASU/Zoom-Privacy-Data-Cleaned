    The Association for Computing Machinery (“ACM“, “we“, “us” or
    “our“) is committed to protecting the privacy of its members and other individuals with whom it
    interacts.
</p>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    This Privacy Policy (“Policy“) explains how we use and maintain the privacy of personal information
    we collect online in connection with the acm.org web site (the “Web Site“). For the purposes of any
    applicable data protection laws (including the EU General Data Protection Regulation), the data controller in
    relation to your personal information is the Association for Computing Machinery, 1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, New
    York, NY 10019-7434.
</p>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    This Policy will apply to personal information ACM collects or otherwise receives about third parties
    (“you“), including ACM members (“Members“), when you use our Web Site or otherwise
    engage with us. Personal information which is provided to us, or otherwise obtained by us, from which you can be
    identified (“Personal Information“) will only be used in the manner set out in this Policy. By
    visiting and/or contacting us through the Web Site (or otherwise engaging with us), you need to be aware that we may
    collect, use and transfer your Personal Information in the manner described in this Policy.
</p>

<h4 _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information</h4>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    ACM only collects Personal Information that is relevant to its activities and seeks to ensure the Personal
    Information is accurate and up-to-date. Personal Information collected by ACM may include: your name, address and
    contact details, including your email address and telephone number, age range, gender, whether you identify as a
    member of an underrepresented group, and if you have a disability. The Personal Information that ACM collects and
    that you provide to us may occasionally be used to improve our Web Site and wider offerings (on a confidential
    basis) or to enable us to comply with our legal obligations. Aside from this we will only use your personal
    Information for staying in touch with you (as described in more detail below) and generally for the purposes for
    which you provided it, including in order to:
</p>
<ul _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
        process your request to join ACM as a member, and for the renewal and update (and general administration) of
        your membership;
    </li>
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
        process orders and supply the products and/or services you have requested and to provide information or support
        to you in respect of those products and/or services;
    </li>
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">process your application and registration for a conference, contest or other activity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">Member Databases</h4>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    ACM maintains member databases that contain mailing, billing, and Member profile information (such as your name,
    address and contact details), as well as a record of each Member’s product and service purchases. ACM also maintains
    databases of Member and non-member purchases and of registrations for conferences and other ACM activities. The
    information in these databases is used by authorized ACM staff members to process orders; mail invoices, purchases,
    renewal notices, and announcements; respond to Member inquiries; and help us improve our offerings. Member records
    are maintained as long as an individual is an ACM member and for two years following a membership lapse. Purchases
    and credit card transactions are retained for as long as required to meet contractual, tax, or auditing needs.
</p>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    All personally identifiable information contained in ACM membership, purchase, and registration databases is treated
    as confidential and will be used only for the purposes stated in this Policy, except where required by law.
</p>

<h4 _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">ACM Emails</h4>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">From time to time, ACM may send emails to Members or other visitors to the Web Site, such as:</p>
<ul _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
        “Must Have” messages that help to service ACM Members including answers to Member questions; acknowledgments of
        the receipt of membership applications, renewal notices, and other orders;
    </li>
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
        Occasional “Member Update” announcements about ACM services that we believe to be of some importance to Members.
        These announcements are short, straightforward messages that contain pointers to online resources where members
        can explore the information more fully;
    </li>
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
        Email messages that are a part of a program for which a Member has registered (e.g. an ACM Digital Library early
        alert email system); and
    </li>
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
        Where we have the consent of Members or users, emails targeted at specific ACM groups and which are on
        distribution lists (e.g. special interest group members, chapter officers, etc.). Only ACM headquarters staff
        can create and support “acm.org” email distribution lists.
    </li>
</ul>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    ACM does not sell, rent, or exchange email addresses of its Members and customers. If at any time you decide that
    you no longer wish to receive any of the emails described above, you may do so by using the “unsubscribe”
    instructions set out at the bottom of each email.
</p>

<h4 _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">ACM Web Accounts</h4>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    Some portions of the ACM Web Site, specifically the ACM Digital Library, require an ACM Web Account for both Members
    and visitors. To create an account, ACM Members and customers must provide their name, Member number (if
    applicable), and email address. They are assigned a “username” (which they may change) and asked to create a
    password and provide the day and month of their birth (for account verification purposes).
</p>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    Non-members are asked for their name and email address when they create their account. ACM may send information
    about ACM products and services which we think may be of interest to non-member ACM Web account holders via email.
    If at any point you decide that you do not want to receive these emails, you may do so by using the “unsubscribe”
    instructions set out at the bottom of each email.
</p>

<h4 _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">Postal Mail</h4>
<ul _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
        ACM also sends information to its Members via post, using the address details provided by Members via the Web
        Site when they join. ACM provides two postal mailing list options to its Members, as follows.
    </li>
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
        ACM Subscription &amp; Renewal Notices: receive only products subscribed to plus renewal invoices.
        ACM Announcements: information about ACM’s Member Value Plus Program (a program offering discounts on products
        and services other than ACM’s.
        You can withdraw your consent to us sharing your Personal Information with our Member Value Plus Program
        partners in this way at any time. To do so, or to otherwise update your postal tolerance, you will need to
        contact ACM’s Member Services Department by phone: +1-212-626-0500, 1-800-342-6626, fax: +1-212-944-1318, or
        email: <a _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="" href="mailto:acmhelp@acm.org" target="_blank">acmhelp@acm.org</a>. You can also go to myacm.acm.org.
    </li>
    <li _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
        Technical Personal Information Other than in the restricted-access portions of the Web Site that require an ACM
        Web Account, ACM does not log the identity of visitors. However, we may keep access logs, for example containing
        a visitor’s IP address and search queries. We may analyze log files periodically to help maintain and improve
        our Web Site and enforce our online service polices. ACM only uses analytical cookies and does not use any
        user-specific targeting cookies. A cookie is a small file of letter and numbers that is placed on your device.
        Cookies are only set by ACM when you visit restricted portions of our Web Site and help us to provide you with
        an enhanced user experience. Raw log files are treated as confidential. Information collected about ACM Web
        account usage (including logs of Web pages visited, searches performed, and Digital Library content downloaded)
        will be stored in an anonymized form and used to improve the ACM Digital Library and other ACM Web offerings.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">Third Parties</h4>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    From time to time, we may share Personal Information about ACM Members and customers with third parties where we
    have your explicit consent or it is necessary (i) for the performance or provision of the goods or services you have
    requested, (ii) in response to valid legal process (for example, a search warrant, subpoena, or court order), or
    (iii) our legitimate business interests. Third parties with whom your Personal Information may be shared include
    outside contractors, auditors, consultants, and others hired by ACM to assist in carrying out financial or
    operational activities. ACM informs these third parties about safeguarding personal information, and requires them
    to use it only for an authorized purpose consistent with this Policy, and to return it to ACM or destroy it upon
    completion of the activity.
</p>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    Conversely, ACM may receive Personal Information from these third parties that they collect from you in the course
    of any engagement you have with them. Where this is the case, once ACM is holding your Personal Information it will
    be treated in accordance with this Policy.
</p>

<h4 _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">Global Transfer of Personal Information</h4>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    The Personal Information you provide to ACM will be transferred to and stored on servers in the United States of
    America, and we take steps to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and against unlawful
    processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.ACM is an international organization and in using and processing
    your Personal Information, it may on occasion be transferred to, stored and/or processed by our offices located
    outside of your country of residence. Similarly, ACM may also transfer your Personal Information from your country
    of residence in connection with our use and retention of your Personal Information as described in this Policy. By
    submitting your Personal Information, you are acknowledging this transfer, storage and processing. As ACM recognizes
    the importance of data security, we require all of our offices to handle your data in accordance with this Policy or
    equivalent data protection provisions, subject to their compliance with local law requirements.
</p>

<h4 _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">Links</h4>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    Our Web Site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the web sites of third parties. If you follow a link
    to any of these web sites, please note that these web sites have their own privacy policies and that we do not
    accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any
    Personal Information to these web sites.
</p>

<h4 _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">Security</h4>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c1159048047="">
    The security of personal information is important to ACM. ACM maintains all personal data with technical,
    administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse,
    modification, and improper disclosure. No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every
    possible hazard. ACM provides reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect personal information against
    foreseeable hazards.

<h5 _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">Informal Negotiations</h5>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">
    To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each
    a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively,
    the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
    provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations
    commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
</p>

<h5 _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">Binding Arbitration</h5>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">
    If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
    expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
    WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be
    commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and,
    where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of
    which are available at the
    <a _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="" sigchi-external-link="" href="https://www.adr.org/" _nghost-ng-c3839765984="" target="_blank"><div _ngcontent-ng-c3839765984="" class="label">
    American Arbitration Association (AAA) website
</div>
</a>. Your
    arbitration fees and your share of
    arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA
    Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and
    expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The
    arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either
    Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
    Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
    The United States, Massachusetts. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
    arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award
    entered by the arbitrator.
</p>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">
    If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted
    in the state and federal courts located in New York, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of
    lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and
    federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and
    the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.
</p>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">
    In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one
    (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
    Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
    unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
    jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
</p>
<h5 _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">Restrictions</h5>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">
    The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full
    extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
    authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
    there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the
    general public or any other persons.
</p>
<h5 _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h5>
<p _ngcontent-ng-c3426695529="">
    The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal
    negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any
