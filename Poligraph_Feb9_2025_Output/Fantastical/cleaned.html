        <p>
          Flexibits, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our”) works hard to build and maintain a relationship of trust with you. This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) governs our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information (as defined below) in connection with your use of our website(s) on which this Privacy Policy is linked (the “Sites”), such as www.flexibits.com and any services, transactions, or other engagements you might have with us including your use of our applications (collectively, “Services”).
        </p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you, how we use or disclose such information, how to exercise any rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information (including any rights to opt-out of certain uses of your information), and the safeguards we have in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and use. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the Personal Information (defined below) of our employees, independent contractors, and job applicants.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please carefully read this Privacy Policy, which is part of our Terms of Service, before using our Sites and/or Services. If you do not agree with our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, you must refrain from using our Sites/Services. By accessing or using our Sites or Services, you agree to our use of your information consistent with our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.

        <h2>ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

        <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy is subject to change. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently for any revisions or amendments. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Sites and will be effective immediately upon posting. You will be deemed to have been made aware of and have accepted the changes by your continued use of our Sites or Services. If we determine that a change to this Privacy Policy will result in using your Personal Information acquired before the change being used in a materially new way, we will provide you notice before using your Personal Information in the new way such as by sending you an email, posting a notice on our Sites, or sending a notice through our applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Conflict Between this Policy and Laws and Regulations</h3>

        <p>
          When federal, state, or local laws and regulations require a higher level of protection for your Personal Information, they take precedence over this Privacy Policy. The specific requirements of this Privacy Policy apply unless disallowed by applicable laws or regulations.

        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

        <h3>Personal Information</h3>

        <p>
          We collect information that personally identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with you (“Personal Information”), including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Identifiers</em> such as name, email address, IP address, billing address, phone number, device ID;
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Commercial Information</em> such as transaction history, payment method information, content of correspondence with us such as emails, chats, or text messages, crash reports, usage analytics, customer satisfaction surveys;
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>User-Created Data</em> such as events, tasks, meeting proposals, reminders, contacts, calendar names, meeting templates, notes; and
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Geolocation Information</em> (approximate).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The specific Personal Information we collect about you may vary based on how you use the Sites and/or Services and your relationship with us such as if you are a user of our products or if you are a contact person for a company with which we do business.
        </p>

        <h3>User-Created Data</h3>

        <p>
          When using our Services, you may create data such as calendars, events, tasks, and more that we refer to in this Privacy Policy as “User-Created Data”. We believe that User-Created Data should be kept on-device and not sent to us to the greatest extent possible; however, there will be times when User-Created Data will need to be sent to us in connection with providing the Services to you. We also believe that it is important for our users to understand how their User-Created Data is handled. Accordingly, we have created a <a href="/privacy/faq">Privacy at Flexibits FAQ</a> which explains in more detail the instances when we need to receive and process User-Created Data off-device and steps we take to limit our ability to access User-Created Data as much as reasonably possible when it is stored on or transmitted through our servers.
        </p>

        <h3>Sites Activity</h3>

        <p>
          We may automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Sites using a tool called <a href="https://matomo.org">Matomo</a>. For example, each time you visit our website, we may automatically collect the type of web browser you use, the type of device you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, the pages you view, referring and exit pages, the date and time of your visit, the number of clicks to, from, and within the Sites, and the duration of your visits to the Sites. This information is anonymized and therefore is not considered Personal Information as defined in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Usage Analytics</h3>

        <p>
          Depending on which of our applications you use, we may collect analytics information about your use of our applications in order to understand how our applications are being used so we can improve them. This analytics data is transmitted to us approximately every 24-48 hours. This data may be anonymized and therefore, if anonymized, is not considered Personal Information as defined in this Privacy Policy. If you are using an application that collects analytics data, we will give you the option to disable analytics in your in-application account settings.
        </p>

        <h3>Communication Recordings</h3>

        <p>
          We may retain the content of text messages or other written/electronic communications between you and us. By communicating with us, you consent to our recording and retention of communications.
        </p>

      <section id="how-we-collect">
        <h2>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h2>

        <h3>Voluntary Disclosure</h3>

        <p>
          We may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you communicate with us (online or offline), use the Sites, purchase Services, and at other times. You are not required to provide us your Personal Information; however, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Sites or Services or we may not be able to fulfill your requested interaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>

        <p>
          You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information we have collected about you.

        </p>

        <h3>Right to Correction</h3>

        <p>
          You may request that we correct information you believe to be inaccurate. When you make your request, please be sure to provide us the specific information that you believe is inaccurate and the correct information. You should also provide us with any documentation you believe supports your proposed correction, and we will take that documentation into consideration. We will only correct the information if we determine, based on the totality of the circumstances, that your correction is more likely than not accurate. We may also choose to delete the allegedly inaccurate information instead of correcting it.
        </p>

        <h3>Right to Appeal</h3>

        <p>
          You have the right to appeal our decision to deny, in full or in part, your exercise of privacy rights by submitting a request to appeal.

        <h2>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PERSONS LOCATED IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, SWITZERLAND, OR THE UNITED KINGDOM</h2>

        <p>
          Flexibits informs you below in accordance with Art. 12, 13 GDPR about the processing of personal data by the Fantastical and Cardhop services as well as about your respective privacy rights.
        </p>

        <p>
          You will find a list of personal data processed by Flexibits in the sections "What personal information do we collect?" and "What data is sent to Flexibits when using Fantastical Openings?". The purpose of processing is to provide the Flexibits services and all functions of our specific services. In addition, Flexibits may process your location to provide weather forecasts and location-specific information. Flexibits also collects data about your use of Flexibits services in order to continuously develop and improve its services.
        </p>

        <p>The legal bases for data processing are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, where processing is required to make the provision of the services to you possible at all;
          </li>
          <li>
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR, to the extent that Flexibits is legally obliged to retain certain data or provide it to authorities;
          </li>
          <li>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR, in cases where Flexibits asks you for your consent to certain data processing;</li>
          <li>
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the legitimate interests of Flexibits and your rights and freedoms do not prevail.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When using Flexibits services, personal data is transferred to servers located in the USA. The legal basis for this transfer is the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission agreed between you and Flexibits. Flexibits maintains comprehensive measures to protect your data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your data will be stored as long as you maintain your accounts. As soon as you delete data or your account, Flexibits will also delete your data from its servers. There may be short delays for technical reasons. We must retain certain data, such as invoices, for a longer period due to retention obligations under tax law.
        </p>

        <p>
          Providing your data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, it is possible that Flexibits will not be able to provide you with its services or individual services if you do not provide certain data.
        </p>

        <p>Automated decision-making, in particular profiling, does not take place.</p>

        <p>
          Under the conditions of the statutory provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the following rights as a data subject:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Access pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR to the personal data stored about you in the form of meaningful information on the details of the processing and a copy of your data;
          </li>
          <li>Rectification in accordance with Art. 16 GDPR of incorrect or incomplete data stored by Flexibits;</li>
          <li>
            Erasure pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR of data stored by Flexibits, unless the processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims;
          </li>
          <li>
            Restriction of processing in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR if the accuracy of the data is disputed, the processing is unlawful, Flexibits no longer needs the data and you refuse to delete it because you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or you have lodged an objection to the processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data portability pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, insofar as you have provided Flexibits with personal data on the basis of consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or on the basis of a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR and these have been processed by Flexibits using automated procedures. You will receive your data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or Flexibits will transmit the data directly to another controller if this is technically feasible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Objection pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR to the processing of your personal data, insofar as this is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e, f GDPR and there are reasons for this arising from your particular situation or the objection is directed against direct advertising. The right to object does not exist if overriding, compelling legitimate grounds for the processing can be demonstrated or the processing is carried out for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. If the right to object does not exist for individual processing operations, this is indicated there.
          </li>
          <li>Withdrawal of your consent in accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR with effect for the future.</li>
          <li>
