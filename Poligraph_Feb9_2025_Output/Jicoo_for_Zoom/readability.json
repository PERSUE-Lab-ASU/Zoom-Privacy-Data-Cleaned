All of the text, data, information, software, graphics, photographs and more that we and our affiliates may make available to you, plus our websites and any services, plug-ins, software, or applications (including Jicoo Click, Jicoo for Chrome, Jicoo for Firefox, and any Jicoo applications) that we may provide all together constitute the Jicoo \u201cWebsite.\u201d Jicoo \u201cUsers\u201d are the people who have created a Jicoo account, and \u201cJicoo Invitees\u201d are people who have scheduled a meeting with a Jicoo User but may or may not have registered with Jicoo. A Jicoo \u201cViewer\u201d is a person who visits the Jicoo Website but may or may not be a Jicoo User or Jicoo Invitee.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAny terms defined in the Terms of Use not otherwise defined in this Privacy Notice are hereby adopted by reference in this Privacy Notice.\u00a0\n\n\n\nInformation We Collect\n\n\n\nWe collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Website.

For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date, and time.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJicoo is not directed to children under sixteen (16) years of age and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 16. If we discover that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will promptly delete such Personal Information from our systems.\u00a0\n\n\n\nInformation You Provide Voluntarily\n\n\n\nJicoo collects the following information, either directly from Jicoo Users, Invitees, or Viewers, or through third-parties regarding Users, Invitees, or Viewers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAppointment Information: A Jicoo User, Invitee, or a third-party may voluntarily give us certain information.

Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don\u2019t book you when you\u2019re busy.
