<p>Jicoo Inc., (“Jicoo”, “we”, or “us”) recognizes the importance of privacy. We want you to feel confident using our services, and this privacy notice (“Privacy Notice” or “Notice”) is to help you understand and describe how we collect, use, and disclose your information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout this document, we will use a few terms to describe various products and roles. All of the text, data, information, software, graphics, photographs and more that we and our affiliates may make available to you, plus our websites and any services, plug-ins, software, or applications (including Jicoo Click, Jicoo for Chrome, Jicoo for Firefox, and any Jicoo applications) that we may provide all together constitute the Jicoo “Website.” Jicoo “Users” are the people who have created a Jicoo account, and “Jicoo Invitees” are people who have scheduled a meeting with a Jicoo User but may or may not have registered with Jicoo. A Jicoo “Viewer” is a person who visits the Jicoo Website but may or may not be a Jicoo User or Jicoo Invitee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any terms defined in the Terms of Use not otherwise defined in this Privacy Notice are hereby adopted by reference in this Privacy Notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>



<p>We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Website. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Website. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date, and time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jicoo is not directed to children under sixteen (16) years of age and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 16. If we discover that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will promptly delete such Personal Information from our systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Information You Provide Voluntarily</strong></p>



<p>Jicoo collects the following information, either directly from Jicoo Users, Invitees, or Viewers, or through third-parties regarding Users, Invitees, or Viewers.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Appointment Information: A Jicoo User, Invitee, or a third-party may voluntarily give us certain information. This can include names, email addresses, and phone numbers; email addresses of other people; the subject of the meeting; and any other information provided to us or as required by the Jicoo User upon scheduling, pursuant to the Jicoo Terms of Use. If you receive an invitation from a Jicoo User but do not wish to become a Jicoo User, please contact the Jicoo User who sent the invitation through other means to set up your meeting.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Calendar Information: A Jicoo User may connect their calendar with Jicoo. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when you’re busy. We never store who you are meeting with, their email address, the meeting title, or any other details about the appointments in your connected calendar.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Billing Information: If you purchase a premium version of Jicoo, our third-party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, card type, and the expiration date.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></p>



<p>Like many websites, we and our Service Providers use Cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device subject to your opt-out preferences (see&nbsp;<strong>Your Rights and Choices section</strong>&nbsp;below).

Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone.

When we use Cookies, we may use ‘session’ Cookies (that last until you close your browser) or ‘persistent’ Cookies (that last until you or your browser deletes them).

<p><strong>Sharing Personal Information</strong></p>



<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to a third-party for a business purpose.

</ol>



<p><strong>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</strong></p>

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will delete (and direct our Service Providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable California Resident request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The request must:</p>



<ol>
<li>Provide sufficiently detailed information to allow Jicoo to reasonably verify that you are the person to whom the requested Personal Information pertains or their authorized representative.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Include sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jicoo will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Response Timing and Format</strong></p>



<p>We will attempt to respond to California Resident requests in as timely a fashion as possible. In the event of delays over 60 days, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable receipt of a California Resident’s request. The response we provide will explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
