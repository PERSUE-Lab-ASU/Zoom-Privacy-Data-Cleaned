                Sensitive information is a sub-set of personal information that
                is given a higher level of protection under the Australian
                Privacy Principles. <strong>Sensitive information</strong> means
                information relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political
                opinions, religion, trade union or other professional
                associations or memberships, philosophical beliefs, sexual
                orientation, sexual practices or sex life, criminal records,
                health information or biometric information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Provided you consent, your sensitive information may only be
                used and disclosed for purposes relating to the primary purpose
                for which the sensitive information was collected. Sensitive
                information may also be used or disclosed if required or
                authorised by law.

                Our responsibilities as a ‘controller’ under the GDPR

                Controllers are defined by the GDPR as natural or legal persons,
                a public authority, agency or other body to which personal
                information or personal data has been disclosed, whether via a
                third party or not, and who determines the purposes and means of
                processing personal information. We are a controller under the
                GDPR as we collect, use and store your personal information to
                enable us to provide you with our goods and/or services.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a controller, we have certain obligations under the GDPR when
                collecting, storing and using the personal information of EU
                citizens. If you are an EU citizen, your personal data will:

                  us;
                </li>
                <li>
                  only be collected for the specific purposes we have identified
                  in the ‘collection and use of personal information’ clause
                  above and personal information will not be further processed
                  in a manner that is incompatible with the purposes we have
                  identified;

                  to what is necessary in relation to the purpose for which the
                  personal information is processed;

                  control to do so (please let us know if you would like us to
                  correct any of your personal information);

                <li>
                  be kept in a form which permits us to identify you, but only
                  for so long as necessary for the purposes for which the

              </ul>
              <p>
                We also apply these principles to the way we collect, store and
                use the personal information of our Australian customers or
                clients.
              </p>

                  personal information, how it is stored and where it goes after
                  we get it, in order to protect your personal information.

                  <strong>Right to ask us to restrict data processing</strong>:
                  You may ask us to limit the processing of your personal
                  information where you believe that the personal information we
                  hold about you is wrong (to give us enough time to verify if
                  the information needs to be changed), or where processing data
                  is unlawful and you request us to restrict the processing of
                  personal information rather than it being erased.

                We are committed to ensuring that the personal information we
                collect is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or
                disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic
                and managerial procedures such as the pseudonymisation and
                encryption of personal information, to safeguard and secure
                personal information and protect it from misuse, interference,
                loss and unauthorised access, modification and disclosure.
              </p>
              <p>
                We cannot guarantee the security of any information that is
                transmitted to or by us over the Internet. The transmission and
                exchange of information is carried out at your own risk.
                Although we take measures to safeguard against unauthorised
                disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that the
                personal information we collect will not be disclosed in a
                manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

                We may use cookies on our Site from time to time. Cookies are
                text files placed in your computer’s browser to store your
                preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email
                address or other personally identifiable information. However,
                they do allow third parties, such as Google and Facebook, to
                cause our advertisements to appear on your social media and
                online media feeds as part of our retargeting campaigns. If and
                when you choose to provide our Site with personal information,
                this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

                We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time. Web
                beacons (also known as Clear GIFs) are small pieces of code
                placed on a web page to monitor the visitor’s behaviour and
                collect data about the visitor’s viewing of a web page. For
                example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a
                web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor
                viewing that page.
