Overview of Workspace ONE UEM</strong></p><p>Workspace ONE UEM (\u201cUEM\u201d) enables Customers to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Customer systems and information that are accessed by Users from corporate-owned and User-owned devices. UEM provides the Customer with controls which enable them to manage the access and security of its User\u2019s devices. UEM consists of a Customer-specific console, which enables the Customer to manage its Users\u2019 devices (\u201cConsole\u201d) and software that is installed on a User\u2019s device, which (i) facilitates communication between the User\u2019s device and the Console, as well as other third-party endpoints (e.g. Apple or Google API) depending on Customer\u2019s configuration, and (ii) provides the User with various productivity applications (i.e. an email client, a web browser, etc.). The specific features available to a Customer or a Customer\u2019s Users will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased, how the Customer configures UEM, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. The Console may be hosted by the Customer in its own IT environment (\u201cOn-Prem\u201d) or may be hosted by Omnissa (\u201cHosted Service\u201d).</p><p><strong>b. Console controls</strong></p><p>The Console provides Customers with controls to assist them in complying with their legal obligations and internal compliance programs and requirements. The specific features available to a Customer or a Customer\u2019s Users will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased, how the Customer configures UEM, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. For example, the Customer can set password complexity, password expiration, and the timing for screen lockouts through the Console for the User\u2019s device. Customer can also choose to enable different settings for corporate-owned devices and User-owned devices. Some of the other options available to Customers are outlined below:</p><p><strong>i. Infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;The Customer chooses whether to host the Console On-Prem or whether to have the Console hosted by Omnissa through the Hosted Service. If a customer wants to maintain greater control over the environment hosting the Console, including the security thereof, the Customer can choose to host the Console On-Prem rather than having the Console hosted by Omnissa. The collected data is available to the Customer via the Console and Omnissa has no access to the data. If the Customer has chosen the Hosted Service, then Omnissa will also have access to the data collected through the Console; however, Omnissa only uses that data as stated in Omnissa\u2019s General Terms&nbsp;and this Privacy Notice.</p><p><strong>ii. Data collection.</strong>&nbsp;Using the Console, the Customer has the ability to control the types of information they collect about Users\u2019 devices. Additionally, the Console gives the Customer the ability to have different data collection practices for corporate-dedicated, corporate-shared, and User-owned devices. For example, through the Console, the Customer can enable or disable the collection of the following data:</p><ul><li>GPS data</li><li>Carrier/Country code</li><li>Roaming status</li><li>Cellular usage data</li><li>Call usage</li><li>SMS usage</li><li>Device phone number</li><li>Personal applications</li><li>Unmanaged profiles</li><li>Public IP address</li></ul><p><strong>iii. Device commands</strong>. Using the Console, the Customer can elect to allow/prevent certain commands and can decide whether the execution of a command requires the User\u2019s permission:</p><ul><li>Device wipe</li><li>Clear device passcode/lock device</li><li>File manager access</li><li>Remote control</li><li>Registry manager</li><li>Request device log</li><li>Command line/remote shell access</li></ul><p><strong>iv. Display of User data</strong>.&nbsp;The Console also contains settings that enable the Customer to decide what User data should be visible to its IT administrators via the Console. For example, the Customer can decide whether the following User data is visible to its IT administrators in the Console:</p><ul><li>First name</li><li>Last name</li><li>Phone number</li><li>Email accounts</li><li>User name</li></ul><p><strong>c. Collection of User and device&nbsp;data through the UEM</strong><br>User data that may be collected by UEM varies depending on the specific version/bundle purchased by the Customer, how the Customer configures UEM, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. Examples of the data that may be collected by UEM are provided below.</p><p><strong>i. General User and device data collected by UEM</strong><br>In connection with its core enterprise mobility management functions, UEM collects user and device data such as the following:</p><p><em><strong>Identity and authentication information</strong></em></p><ul><li>Identity details (including name, email address, phone number, etc.)</li><li>Login credentials and security authentication data (including certificates, domain information, login and logout dates and times, usernames, enrollment IDs, etc.). Workspace ONE UEM does not store user credentials derived from customer Active Directory (AD) integration.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Employment information</strong></em></p><ul><li>Employer, job title, work address, employee number</li><li>Information maintained in the Customer\u2019s Active Directory</li></ul><p><em><strong>Device information</strong></em></p><ul><li>Device type, name, make, model, manufacturer, and device identifiers such as universal unique identifier (\u201cUUID\u201d), International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (\u201cIMEI\u201d), mobile equipment identifier (\u201cMEID\u201d), serial number, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (\u201cIMSI\u201d) number, Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address and Media Access Control (\u201cMAC\u201d) address</li><li>Last seen information (i.e., when the device last connected to the Console), log data</li><li>Information about the device\u2019s operating system (including operating system build, version, firmware/kernel versions, etc.)</li><li>Battery capacity and availability, memory capacity and availability, storage capacity and availability</li><li>Installed profiles on the device, including configuration data of Users\u2019 devices and compliance status concerning requirements defined by the Customer in its Console settings</li><li>Information about the device\u2019s file manager and registry manager (Android/Windows devices)</li></ul><p>UEM also may collect user and device data in connection with the following:</p><p><em><strong>Data about Customer-Managed Applications</strong></em></p><p>\u201cCustomer-Managed Applications\u201d are Customer approved applications that are either pushed to User devices by the Customer or made available for download through the Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub app (formerly the AirWatch Agent), Workspace ONE App Catalog, or Customer application catalogues. These mobile applications may be public applications or internally-created applications. Information collected in connection with Customer-Managed Applications may include:</p><ul><li>Names and details of Customer-Managed Applications installed on the device, such as application name, version number, file size, configuration settings, installation progress status, app failure error codes, etc.</li><li>Technical data generated from the use of Customer-Managed Applications, such as launch activities, clickstream data, crash reports and log files, which may contain personal data about the User.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Data about Personal Applications:</strong></em>&nbsp;\u201cPersonal Applications\u201d are the applications Users purchase or download from a public app store (e.g. the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store) to their devices. They are not automatically pushed to the User\u2019s devices by Customer and are not managed via UEM. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, UEM may collect limited details about Personal Applications to assist the Customer in knowing/verifying that its Users do not download Personal Applications which may pose a security threat. UEM does not collect or have access to any data inside any Personal Applications. The information collected about Personal Applications may include:</p><ul><li>Name, version, identifier, and total size of Personal Applications installed on the deviceh</li></ul><p><em><strong>File manager access:</strong></em>&nbsp;File manager access is functionality that allows read-only access to a device\u2019s internal and external storage. Certain mobile applications (such as Workspace ONE Content, formerly known as Omnissa Content Locker) may request file manager access from a User so that data may be synced between the User\u2019s device and the Customer\u2019s systems, files could be attached to emails that the User wants to send, etc. When enabled, UEM may collect the contents of the device storage, including the SD card and locally stored files. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, certain applications like Workspace ONE Assist may have read and write access to the device file system based on the platform type and the permissions granted by the User.</p><p><em><strong>Telecom and network information:&nbsp;</strong></em>UEM may collect certain telecom data, such as carrier information, roaming status, and networks being used. This information helps the Customer know how the device is connected, to communicate with the device, and to enforce any restrictions implemented by Customer in its use of UEM, such as preventing large applications from automatically being pushed to a device that is roaming. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, this telecom and network information may include the following:</p><ul><li>Carrier information (including carrier settings versions, phone number, signal strength, roaming status, current and subscriber mobile country code and country location, current and subscriber mobile network code, SIM Carrier Network information, etc.)</li><li>Information about the device\u2019s cellular technology (such as its Global System for Mobile Communications Standard (\u201cGSM\u201d) and Code Division Multiple Access (\u201cCDMA\u201d))</li><li>SSID, Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) and Media Access Control (\u201cMAC\u201d) addresses for the Wi-Fi network being used</li><li>Amount of data used by the network connections, cellular data usage, and aggregated information about Wi-Fi bandwidth consumption (excluding content)</li></ul><p><em><strong>Communication data:</strong></em>&nbsp;The Customer may configure UEM to collect usage information, such as the number of calls and text messages sent or received. This information may assist the Customer in managing SMS limits on the Customer\u2019s cellular plan. UEM does not collect or have access to the contents of text messages, phone calls, or personal email accounts. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, this communications data may include:</p><ul><li>The amount of data used, the number of SMS sent or received, phone call usage statistics (number of calls sent or received, duration of calls), broken down on an enrolled device phone number basis</li><li>Name of sender, name of recipient, date, time</li></ul><p><em><strong>Geo-location data:&nbsp;</strong></em>Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, UEM may collect geo-location data. By default, it does not collect geo-location data. UEM enables the Customer to collect geo-location data as it may enable a Customer to locate lost devices or to distribute functionality and content based on certain geo-fenced locations. Depending on the operating system and platform of the device, the User may be presented with an operating system notice, asking for the User\u2019s consent to collect geo-location data. The User can change their selection by going into their device settings and revoking the geo-location permission.</p><p><em><strong>Data via remote access:&nbsp;</strong></em>The Customer can use UEM to establish remote control access, which allows a Customer\u2019s IT administrators to assist in troubleshooting a User\u2019s device issue by remotely taking control of the device. A remote-control application must be installed on the device and, depending on platform and configuration, remote control may need to be approved by the User at the time when remote control is to be taken. This functionality enables the Customer to remotely access or control the device, including the use of remote locks, screen capture, remote device reboots or remote restart (for the device or applications).</p><p><strong>ii. Additional data for specialized Omnissa Mobile App functionality</strong><br>Omnissa provides various mobile applications in connection with UEM (\u201cOmnissa Mobile Apps\u201d). Some of these Omnissa Mobile Apps collect or share additional data in order to support their specialized functionality. For example, Omnissa Mobile Apps that provide VPN or internet browsing functionality (such as Boxer and Web) collect the URLs visited through those Omnissa Mobile Apps. The data collected and shared will vary depending on the functionality provided by the mobile application, as detailed further in the product documentation. Below are some examples of this additional data collected by specific Omnissa Mobile Apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Omnissa Workspace ONE Boxer.&nbsp;</strong>Workspace ONE Boxer provides access to enterprise email, calendar and contacts. Boxer does not host the email or calendar content; instead, Boxer provides direct communication between the Customer\u2019s backend email system and the User\u2019s device. To operate, Boxer collects certain email header information (such as sender/recipient name, date, time, subject line, etc.) If configured to do so, Boxer has access to User device calendars to overlay the User\u2019s corporate calendar and access to User device contacts to display them in Boxer as well as to write corporate contacts to the device contact app for call identification purposes. Boxer may also be configured to collect header information and snippets of the email body in order to generate a contextual notification and send to a User\u2019s mobile device to deliver updates of incoming messages. The User can enable/disable these features via the UEM Console and mobile device operating system settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Workspace ONE Boxer\u2019s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google Accounts will adhere to&nbsp;Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</li><li><strong>Omnissa Workspace ONE Web.&nbsp;</strong>Workspace ONE Web provides Users with secure VPN access to internet and intranet sites. It may also provide single sign-on capabilities allowing Users with access to the Customer designated web sites and web apps without the need to enter credentials. Web enables direct communication between Web on the User\u2019s device and Customer\u2019s backend systems. To operate, Web collects certain additional information such as the browser information and browsing history on the User\u2019s device. Web records the URLs of websites and web pages viewed using Web but Web does not give Omnissa access to the content viewed using Web. (For clarity, UEM may have access to that content to the extent the Customer maintains the content in Omnissa Hosted Services.)</li><li><strong>Omnissa Workspace ONE Content.</strong>&nbsp;Workspace ONE Content allows Customer content to be uploaded, stored, edited, shared and accessed from a User\u2019s device. The content is stored in a corporate container on the User\u2019s device or in a managed server-side repository, which the Customer may host using UEM (either On-Prem or in the Hosted Service, depending on the Customer\u2019s deployment) or which the Customer may maintain in third-party services. The Content mobile app allows the User to securely access, distribute and collaborate on content from their device. The Customer may configure Content to allow or limit access to certain content. If Content is used, UEM will have access to data such as the date and times when files are accessed and shared, file size, file names, a history of User actions inside the Content, and details regarding with whom the User interacts through Content. Content has a geo-fencing feature that allows the Customer\u2019s IT administrators to place geo-fencing restrictions on access to content stored in Content. The geo-fencing feature does not transmit the User\u2019s geo-location data to the Console; instead, the Content mobile application uses the geo-location data locally on the device to perform the geo-fencing.</li><li><strong>Omnissa Workspace ONE Assist.</strong>&nbsp;The Workspace ONE Assist application provides Customer\u2019s IT and support personnel with the ability to remotely view and control the device screen and applications, managed files and run commands with the User\u2019s permission. Assist also provides the ability to capture screenshots and record the device screen for troubleshooting and training purposes. The level of access is configurable by the Customer.</li><li><strong>OEM Supplements to Agent App.&nbsp;</strong>For certain Customers, Omnissa operates customized OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer referring to the hardware or platform manufacturer) mobile applications that accompany its standard Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub, used for mobile device management. These OEM mobile applications may offer additional functionality and collect additional data points based on the Customer\u2019s and/or device\u2019s specifications. For example, this may include information about carrier codes, battery health, and other data related to the Customer\u2019s device or product specifications.</li><li><strong>Workspace ONE Tunnel App</strong>. The app is used to securely provide either per-App or Full Device VPN capabilities across all employees\u2019 devices and is delivered with a modern Zero Trust architecture. It is a part of the <em>AnyWhere Workspace</em> solution set for enabling remote work and enforcing endpoint compliance.To operate, Tunnel collects certain additional information such as application bundle IDs, URLs accessed through managed applications, device network information, diagnostic information such as crash logs, service start/stop events, network errors, and runtime exceptions. Tunnel provides the user to opt out for data collection for information such as crash logs.</li><li><strong>Workspace ONE Launcher</strong>&nbsp;application helps organizations securely manage shared Android devices, especially for frontline workers. It allows devices to be configured in&nbsp;single&nbsp;or&nbsp;multi-app kiosk mode, ensuring that workers only have access to the apps and settings they need to perform their tasks. This tool improves security by locking devices to specific configurations and also supports&nbsp;check-in/check-out functionality, allowing different users to share a device while keeping their sessions secure and private.&nbsp;Customer administrators can fully customize the user interface (UI), manage device settings remotely, and enforce device restrictions, such as disabling notifications or access to certain settings. The Omnissa Workspace ONE Launcher is particularly beneficial in industries where shared devices are common, such as logistics, retail, and healthcare, as it simplifies device management while maintaining a high level of security and worker productivity. The Omnissa Workspace ONE Launcher collects the following permissions and data:<ol><li><p>Permissions required to be granted by the user manually:&nbsp;</p><p>a. Mandatory</p><ul><li><em>UsageAccess Permission</em></li><li><em>DrawOverOtherApps Permission&nbsp;</em></li></ul><p>b. As needed for the features configured</p><ul><li><em>Notifications Access permission &nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Write Settings Permission &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>All File Access permission &nbsp;</em></li></ul></li><li><p>Permission acquired automatically from the Device Policy Controller DPC/Workspace ONE Hub</p><p>a. Location access:&nbsp;depending on the customer configuration, this could be coarse location or precise location</p><p>b. Internet Usage, such as&nbsp;content download/upload, API Calls, communication, etc.</p><p>c. Network state</p><p>d. \u201cRead phone state\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;which is an Android permission that allows Omnissa Workspace ONE Launcher to access a device's phone number, current network information, and the status of any calls,&nbsp;</p><p>e. Call Phone&nbsp;allowing or denying ability to make a phone call</p><p>f. Read and write external storage</p><p>g. Post Notifications (i.e., &nbsp;ability to send and control app notifications)</p></li></ol></li></ul><p><strong>iii. Software Development Kit (SDK).&nbsp;</strong>The Workspace ONE Software Development Kit (\u201cWorkspace ONE SDK\u201d) is a code library that mobile app developers can use to build security, configurations and management capabilities into their own, non-Omnissa mobile applications. Apps that use the Workspace ONE SDK collect and transmit certain data back to Omnissa, such as identity and authentication information and device information as described above, as well as crash reporting data and analytics data as described below. When an app uses the Workspace ONE SDK to provide tunneling functionality, the app also transmits to Omnissa\u2019s systems the URLs of the sites accessed using that tunneling functionality. Developers of third-party apps that use the Workspace ONE SDK also may configure the Workspace ONE SDK to collect other custom data points as they determine in their discretion. This Privacy Disclosure describes only Omnissa\u2019s collection of user data from the Workspace ONE SDK; it does not address the practices of third-party developers that may incorporate the Workspace ONE SDK into their non-Omnissa mobile apps.</p><p><strong>d. Intel Device Health and Chip to Cloud</strong></p><p>This section covers Intel Device Health and Chip to Cloud, which are optional add-on features powered by Intel and available for select Workspace ONE SKUs.</p><p><strong>i. Overview of the Intel Device Health service.&nbsp;</strong>Intel Device Health (IDH) helps Customers to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Customer systems and information that are accessed by Users from corporate-owned and User-owned laptops. IDH does this by helping to detect threats to the security of those laptops, particularly firmware-related threats. IDH threat analysis information is fed back to the Workspace ONE console where Customers can see and evaluate potential vulnerabilities of enrolled laptops. Customers may use this information to respond to threats by, for example, requiring end users to update their OS.</p><p><strong>ii. IDH data collection.</strong> If IDH is enabled, enrolled laptops send data directly to Intel. Collected data includes information about installed operating system, Intel-based applications, drivers and BIOS; information about the device such as manufacturer, model number, serial number, SKU, and motherboard and CPU details; and country.&nbsp; Intel sends threat analysis results to Omnissa for display in the Workspace ONE console.</p><p><strong>iii. Use of IDH data by Intel.</strong> Intel uses the data collected not only to deliver the IDH threat analysis service, but also to enhance its own threat intelligence and threat detection capabilities. For information about how Intel will use that data, see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/privacy/intel-privacy-notice.html\">Intel Privacy Notice</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>iv. Chip to Cloud.</strong> Chip to Cloud functionality enables administrators to remotely perform power actions on Intel Active Management Technology (AMT)-enabled managed devices such as Power On, Power Off, Reset, and Power Cycle. Administrators may also remotely access the device to assume KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) control, including seeing the end user\u2019s screen, if the end user provides consent to such remote access at that time.</p><p><strong>e. Device wiping</strong></p><p>UEM allows for two different types of device wiping:</p><ul><li><em>Enterprise Wipe&nbsp;</em>\u2013 An Enterprise Wipe deletes all Customer-Managed Applications and any information stored in the Customer-Managed Applications. Enterprise Wipes will not remove Personal Applications or photos, videos, text messages, or personal email stored in Personal Applications.</li><li><em>Full Device Wipe&nbsp;</em>\u2013 A Full Device Wipe is a complete full factory reset. Full Device Wipes will remove all data and applications from the device.</li></ul><p>The Customer\u2019s IT administrator may select which device wiping feature is enabled and can perform these wipes from the Console, either manually or via an automated compliance action. The ability to perform a Full Device Wipe for a device cannot be turned on for a particular device after enrollment, meaning if the setting is off when the User enrolls the device, the Customer cannot perform a Full Device Wipe on a User\u2019s device even if the Customer enables the Full Device Wipe setting in the Console. Depending on the Customer\u2019s configuration, Users may be able to choose to perform an Enterprise Wipe on their devices from the self-service portal.</p><h3>PART II: Omnissa Access</h3><p>This section covers&nbsp;Omnissa Access&nbsp;(formerly Omnissa Identity Manager, \"Access\"), which enables identity and access management as part of the Workspace ONE platform. Omnissa Access use cases include but are not limited to single sign on, multifactor authentication, conditional access, and identity security.</p><p><strong>a. Overview of Omnissa Access</strong></p><p>Omnissa Access combines the User\u2019s identity with factors such as device and network information to make intelligence driven, conditional access decisions for applications delivered by Workspace ONE. Access acts as a broker to other identity stores and providers (such as Active Directory (AD), Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Azure AD, Okta and Ping Identity) that Customers may already be using to enable authentication across on-premises, SaaS, web and native applications without the need to rearchitect the identity environment.</p><p><strong>b. Collection of User and device data through Access</strong></p><p><strong>i. User data.&nbsp;</strong>Omnissa Access collects data about Users who are using the Workspace ONE platform. Typically, the data is synced from Customer\u2019s directory with certain required attributes, as well as optional attributes that Customers can configure. Required User data that is synced with Access:</p><ul><li>Username</li><li>Email</li><li>First and last name</li></ul><p>Customers can customize additional attributes to sync to Access for the purposes of policy creation or application entitlements.</p><p><strong>ii. Authentication data.</strong>&nbsp;When Users log in to the Workspace ONE platform using their username and password credentials, Omnissa does not store credentials in Access, but validates Users\u2019 input by reaching out to Customer\u2019s directory that Access has been integrated with, and validating the credentials.</p><p>In some cases, Access may cache credentials for the duration of User sessions on a User\u2019s device to enable features such as integration with other applications like Omnissa&nbsp;Horizon\u00ae or Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops to prevent double prompting when Users launch virtual resources. This functionality can be configured or disabled by Customer\u2019s IT admin using Access.</p><p>Customers can also enable other authentication methods that do not involve credentials such as certificate-based authentication. To use certificate authentication, Customer IT administrators must upload root certificates and intermediate certificates to the Omnissa Access connector. The certificates are copied to the local certificate store on the User device. These certificates are not replicated in the Omnissa Access database.</p><p><strong>iii. Logging data.&nbsp;</strong>Omnissa Access will also generate audit logs for all User activity. For instance, what applications User is launching, time of the launch, authentication methods used, etc. These logs can be retained within Omnissa Access, or they can be sent to Omnissa Intelligence for analytical purposes. For example, User login activity data can be used in Omnissa Intelligence to identify user behavior anomalies and notify the Customer IT administrator. Sending logs to Omnissa Intelligence is configurable and optional functionality.</p><h3>PART III: Omnissa Workspace ONE Hub Services</h3><p>This section covers Workspace ONE Hub Services (\u201cHub Services\u201d), which provide Users with a single destination to access, discover, and connect with corporate resources, applications, teams, and workflows via the Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub application.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>a. Overview of Workspace ONE Hub Services</strong></p><p>Hub Services provide a collection of services that are co-located with Omnissa Access and can be deployed On-Prem or as a Hosted Service. Customers can choose to enable one or more Hub Services capabilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Hub catalog.</strong>&nbsp;Provides a branded and customized enterprise app store for native, web and virtual Customer apps for discovery and Single-Sign-On access by Users.</li><li><strong>Notifications.</strong>&nbsp;Provides personalized push and in-app notifications to Users of Customer communications including system downtimes, survey participation, and updates around enrollments.</li><li><strong>People.&nbsp;</strong>Provides employee directory for quick lookup of colleague information along with an organization chart.</li><li><strong>Custom Tab.</strong>&nbsp;Provides access to Customer resources through embeddable intranet or company portal within a customizable tab.</li><li><strong>Support.</strong>&nbsp;Provides self-service capability for Users to access helpful links and manage their devices.</li><li><strong>Virtual assistant.&nbsp;</strong>Provides Users the ability to find answers to common Customer questions, troubleshoot issues and complete workflows like ordering a new device through a chatbot style interaction.</li></ul><p><strong>b. Collection of User and device data through Hub Services</strong></p><p><strong>i. Authentication.</strong>&nbsp;Hub Services relies on UEM or Access for user authentication as defined by Customer\u2019s IT administrator in the UEM Console as part of source of authentication configuration.</p><p><strong>ii. User data.</strong>&nbsp;Customers can use Hub Service admin console to create and send push notifications to Users. In addition, notifications can be generated based on changes in third-party business systems when integrated via Workspace ONE Mobile Flows. Notification related data generated through Hub Services admin console or Mobile Flows is stored in Hub Services data store. In addition to the notification content, Hub Service collects individual notification acted on state, and target User device identifiers including UUID.</p><p>Customers can turn on the app rating feature to collect User feedback. When enabled, Hub Services collects User\u2019s external Id and app Id. Customer IT administrators can download a report of aggregated app ratings with following data points: app name, app ID, platform, app version, app type, catalog provider, likes and dislikes. Hub Services does not disclose individual User ratings for different apps to Customer\u2019s IT administrator.</p><p>When User favorites/unfavorites an app, Hub Services stores app Id favorited/unfavorited by User along with the device type to indicate the platform from which User has favorited/unfavorited the app from.</p><p>When User searches for a colleague using People tab, Hub Services stores the most recent search result for that User.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>iii. Logging data.&nbsp;</strong>Workspace ONE Hub Services generates audit logs for User activity. Hub Services logs the source of authentication (UEM or Access), username, external Id and app Id. For instance, app Id is logged: 1) when Users favorites or unfavorites an app; 2) when Users change the order of apps in favorites tab; 3) when install action is invoked on an app; or 4) when apps are launched from Hub Services app.</p><h3>PART IV: Omnissa Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense and Mobile Applications Powered by Lookout</h3><p>This section covers Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense service (\u201cMTD\u201d), which is an optional feature add-on available for Hub Services and is a Hosted Service powered by Lookout, Inc., including the related mobile applications.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>a.&nbsp;Overview of Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense service</strong><br>Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense service helps Customers to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Customer systems and information that are accessed by Users from corporate-owned and User-owned devices by helping to detect and protect against threats to the security of those devices. MTD provides the Customer with controls which enable them to respond to threats to enrolled mobile devices. MTD consists of a Customer-specific console, which enables the Customer to monitor threats to its Users\u2019 devices (\u201cConsole\u201d), and software that is installed on a User\u2019s device. The specific features available, and the applicable on-device software application, will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased, how the Customer configures MTD, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) are used by the Users.

Overview of Workspace ONE UEMWorkspace ONE UEM (\u201cUEM\u201d) enables Customers to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Customer systems and information that are accessed by Users from corporate-owned and User-owned devices. UEM provides the Customer with controls which enable them to manage the access and security of its User\u2019s devices. UEM consists of a Customer-specific console, which enables the Customer to manage its Users\u2019 devices (\u201cConsole\u201d) and software that is installed on a User\u2019s device, which (i) facilitates communication between the User\u2019s device and the Console, as well as other third-party endpoints (e.g. Apple or Google API) depending on Customer\u2019s configuration, and (ii) provides the User with various productivity applications (i.e. an email client, a web browser, etc.). The specific features available to a Customer or a Customer\u2019s Users will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased, how the Customer configures UEM, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. The Console may be hosted by the Customer in its own IT environment (\u201cOn-Prem\u201d) or may be hosted by Omnissa (\u201cHosted Service\u201d).b. Console controlsThe Console provides Customers with controls to assist them in complying with their legal obligations and internal compliance programs and requirements. The specific features available to a Customer or a Customer\u2019s Users will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased, how the Customer configures UEM, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. For example, the Customer can set password complexity, password expiration, and the timing for screen lockouts through the Console for the User\u2019s device. Customer can also choose to enable different settings for corporate-owned devices and User-owned devices. Some of the other options available to Customers are outlined below:i. Infrastructure.\u00a0The Customer chooses whether to host the Console On-Prem or whether to have the Console hosted by Omnissa through the Hosted Service. If a customer wants to maintain greater control over the environment hosting the Console, including the security thereof, the Customer can choose to host the Console On-Prem rather than having the Console hosted by Omnissa. The collected data is available to the Customer via the Console and Omnissa has no access to the data. If the Customer has chosen the Hosted Service, then Omnissa will also have access to the data collected through the Console; however, Omnissa only uses that data as stated in Omnissa\u2019s General Terms\u00a0and this Privacy Notice.ii. Data collection.\u00a0Using the Console, the Customer has the ability to control the types of information they collect about Users\u2019 devices. Additionally, the Console gives the Customer the ability to have different data collection practices for corporate-dedicated, corporate-shared, and User-owned devices. For example, through the Console, the Customer can enable or disable the collection of the following data:GPS dataCarrier/Country codeRoaming statusCellular usage dataCall usageSMS usageDevice phone numberPersonal applicationsUnmanaged profilesPublic IP addressiii. Device commands. Using the Console, the Customer can elect to allow/prevent certain commands and can decide whether the execution of a command requires the User\u2019s permission:Device wipeClear device passcode/lock deviceFile manager accessRemote controlRegistry managerRequest device logCommand line/remote shell accessiv. Display of User data.\u00a0The Console also contains settings that enable the Customer to decide what User data should be visible to its IT administrators via the Console. For example, the Customer can decide whether the following User data is visible to its IT administrators in the Console:First nameLast namePhone numberEmail accountsUser namec. Collection of User and device\u00a0data through the UEMUser data that may be collected by UEM varies depending on the specific version/bundle purchased by the Customer, how the Customer configures UEM, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. Examples of the data that may be collected by UEM are provided below.i. General User and device data collected by UEMIn connection with its core enterprise mobility management functions, UEM collects user and device data such as the following:Identity and authentication informationIdentity details (including name, email address, phone number, etc.)Login credentials and security authentication data (including certificates, domain information, login and logout dates and times, usernames, enrollment IDs, etc.). Workspace ONE UEM does not store user credentials derived from customer Active Directory (AD) integration.Employment informationEmployer, job title, work address, employee numberInformation maintained in the Customer\u2019s Active DirectoryDevice informationDevice type, name, make, model, manufacturer, and device identifiers such as universal unique identifier (\u201cUUID\u201d), International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (\u201cIMEI\u201d), mobile equipment identifier (\u201cMEID\u201d), serial number, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (\u201cIMSI\u201d) number, Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address and Media Access Control (\u201cMAC\u201d) addressLast seen information (i.e., when the device last connected to the Console), log dataInformation about the device\u2019s operating system (including operating system build, version, firmware/kernel versions, etc.)Battery capacity and availability, memory capacity and availability, storage capacity and availabilityInstalled profiles on the device, including configuration data of Users\u2019 devices and compliance status concerning requirements defined by the Customer in its Console settingsInformation about the device\u2019s file manager and registry manager (Android/Windows devices)UEM also may collect user and device data in connection with the following:Data about Customer-Managed Applications\u201cCustomer-Managed Applications\u201d are Customer approved applications that are either pushed to User devices by the Customer or made available for download through the Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub app (formerly the AirWatch Agent), Workspace ONE App Catalog, or Customer application catalogues. These mobile applications may be public applications or internally-created applications. Information collected in connection with Customer-Managed Applications may include:Names and details of Customer-Managed Applications installed on the device, such as application name, version number, file size, configuration settings, installation progress status, app failure error codes, etc.Technical data generated from the use of Customer-Managed Applications, such as launch activities, clickstream data, crash reports and log files, which may contain personal data about the User.Data about Personal Applications:\u00a0\u201cPersonal Applications\u201d are the applications Users purchase or download from a public app store (e.g. the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store) to their devices. They are not automatically pushed to the User\u2019s devices by Customer and are not managed via UEM. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, UEM may collect limited details about Personal Applications to assist the Customer in knowing/verifying that its Users do not download Personal Applications which may pose a security threat. UEM does not collect or have access to any data inside any Personal Applications. The information collected about Personal Applications may include:Name, version, identifier, and total size of Personal Applications installed on the devicehFile manager access:\u00a0File manager access is functionality that allows read-only access to a device\u2019s internal and external storage. Certain mobile applications (such as Workspace ONE Content, formerly known as Omnissa Content Locker) may request file manager access from a User so that data may be synced between the User\u2019s device and the Customer\u2019s systems, files could be attached to emails that the User wants to send, etc. When enabled, UEM may collect the contents of the device storage, including the SD card and locally stored files. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, certain applications like Workspace ONE Assist may have read and write access to the device file system based on the platform type and the permissions granted by the User.Telecom and network information:\u00a0UEM may collect certain telecom data, such as carrier information, roaming status, and networks being used. This information helps the Customer know how the device is connected, to communicate with the device, and to enforce any restrictions implemented by Customer in its use of UEM, such as preventing large applications from automatically being pushed to a device that is roaming. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, this telecom and network information may include the following:Carrier information (including carrier settings versions, phone number, signal strength, roaming status, current and subscriber mobile country code and country location, current and subscriber mobile network code, SIM Carrier Network information, etc.)Information about the device\u2019s cellular technology (such as its Global System for Mobile Communications Standard (\u201cGSM\u201d) and Code Division Multiple Access (\u201cCDMA\u201d))SSID, Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) and Media Access Control (\u201cMAC\u201d) addresses for the Wi-Fi network being usedAmount of data used by the network connections, cellular data usage, and aggregated information about Wi-Fi bandwidth consumption (excluding content)Communication data:\u00a0The Customer may configure UEM to collect usage information, such as the number of calls and text messages sent or received. This information may assist the Customer in managing SMS limits on the Customer\u2019s cellular plan. UEM does not collect or have access to the contents of text messages, phone calls, or personal email accounts. Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, this communications data may include:The amount of data used, the number of SMS sent or received, phone call usage statistics (number of calls sent or received, duration of calls), broken down on an enrolled device phone number basisName of sender, name of recipient, date, timeGeo-location data:\u00a0Depending on how the Customer has configured UEM, UEM may collect geo-location data. By default, it does not collect geo-location data. UEM enables the Customer to collect geo-location data as it may enable a Customer to locate lost devices or to distribute functionality and content based on certain geo-fenced locations. Depending on the operating system and platform of the device, the User may be presented with an operating system notice, asking for the User\u2019s consent to collect geo-location data. The User can change their selection by going into their device settings and revoking the geo-location permission.Data via remote access:\u00a0The Customer can use UEM to establish remote control access, which allows a Customer\u2019s IT administrators to assist in troubleshooting a User\u2019s device issue by remotely taking control of the device. A remote-control application must be installed on the device and, depending on platform and configuration, remote control may need to be approved by the User at the time when remote control is to be taken. This functionality enables the Customer to remotely access or control the device, including the use of remote locks, screen capture, remote device reboots or remote restart (for the device or applications).ii. Additional data for specialized Omnissa Mobile App functionalityOmnissa provides various mobile applications in connection with UEM (\u201cOmnissa Mobile Apps\u201d). Some of these Omnissa Mobile Apps collect or share additional data in order to support their specialized functionality. For example, Omnissa Mobile Apps that provide VPN or internet browsing functionality (such as Boxer and Web) collect the URLs visited through those Omnissa Mobile Apps. The data collected and shared will vary depending on the functionality provided by the mobile application, as detailed further in the product documentation. Below are some examples of this additional data collected by specific Omnissa Mobile Apps:Omnissa Workspace ONE Boxer.\u00a0Workspace ONE Boxer provides access to enterprise email, calendar and contacts. Boxer does not host the email or calendar content; instead, Boxer provides direct communication between the Customer\u2019s backend email system and the User\u2019s device. To operate, Boxer collects certain email header information (such as sender/recipient name, date, time, subject line, etc.) If configured to do so, Boxer has access to User device calendars to overlay the User\u2019s corporate calendar and access to User device contacts to display them in Boxer as well as to write corporate contacts to the device contact app for call identification purposes. Boxer may also be configured to collect header information and snippets of the email body in order to generate a contextual notification and send to a User\u2019s mobile device to deliver updates of incoming messages. The User can enable/disable these features via the UEM Console and mobile device operating system settings.\u00a0\u00a0Workspace ONE Boxer\u2019s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google Accounts will adhere to\u00a0Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.Omnissa Workspace ONE Web.\u00a0Workspace ONE Web provides Users with secure VPN access to internet and intranet sites. It may also provide single sign-on capabilities allowing Users with access to the Customer designated web sites and web apps without the need to enter credentials. Web enables direct communication between Web on the User\u2019s device and Customer\u2019s backend systems. To operate, Web collects certain additional information such as the browser information and browsing history on the User\u2019s device. Web records the URLs of websites and web pages viewed using Web but Web does not give Omnissa access to the content viewed using Web. (For clarity, UEM may have access to that content to the extent the Customer maintains the content in Omnissa Hosted Services.)Omnissa Workspace ONE Content.\u00a0Workspace ONE Content allows Customer content to be uploaded, stored, edited, shared and accessed from a User\u2019s device. The content is stored in a corporate container on the User\u2019s device or in a managed server-side repository, which the Customer may host using UEM (either On-Prem or in the Hosted Service, depending on the Customer\u2019s deployment) or which the Customer may maintain in third-party services. The Content mobile app allows the User to securely access, distribute and collaborate on content from their device. The Customer may configure Content to allow or limit access to certain content. If Content is used, UEM will have access to data such as the date and times when files are accessed and shared, file size, file names, a history of User actions inside the Content, and details regarding with whom the User interacts through Content. Content has a geo-fencing feature that allows the Customer\u2019s IT administrators to place geo-fencing restrictions on access to content stored in Content. The geo-fencing feature does not transmit the User\u2019s geo-location data to the Console; instead, the Content mobile application uses the geo-location data locally on the device to perform the geo-fencing.Omnissa Workspace ONE Assist.\u00a0The Workspace ONE Assist application provides Customer\u2019s IT and support personnel with the ability to remotely view and control the device screen and applications, managed files and run commands with the User\u2019s permission. Assist also provides the ability to capture screenshots and record the device screen for troubleshooting and training purposes. The level of access is configurable by the Customer.OEM Supplements to Agent App.\u00a0For certain Customers, Omnissa operates customized OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer referring to the hardware or platform manufacturer) mobile applications that accompany its standard Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub, used for mobile device management. These OEM mobile applications may offer additional functionality and collect additional data points based on the Customer\u2019s and/or device\u2019s specifications. For example, this may include information about carrier codes, battery health, and other data related to the Customer\u2019s device or product specifications.Workspace ONE Tunnel App. The app is used to securely provide either per-App or Full Device VPN capabilities across all employees\u2019 devices and is delivered with a modern Zero Trust architecture. It is a part of the AnyWhere Workspace solution set for enabling remote work and enforcing endpoint compliance.To operate, Tunnel collects certain additional information such as application bundle IDs, URLs accessed through managed applications, device network information, diagnostic information such as crash logs, service start/stop events, network errors, and runtime exceptions. Tunnel provides the user to opt out for data collection for information such as crash logs.Workspace ONE Launcher\u00a0application helps organizations securely manage shared Android devices, especially for frontline workers. It allows devices to be configured in\u00a0single\u00a0or\u00a0multi-app kiosk mode, ensuring that workers only have access to the apps and settings they need to perform their tasks. This tool improves security by locking devices to specific configurations and also supports\u00a0check-in/check-out functionality, allowing different users to share a device while keeping their sessions secure and private.\u00a0Customer administrators can fully customize the user interface (UI), manage device settings remotely, and enforce device restrictions, such as disabling notifications or access to certain settings. The Omnissa Workspace ONE Launcher is particularly beneficial in industries where shared devices are common, such as logistics, retail, and healthcare, as it simplifies device management while maintaining a high level of security and worker productivity. The Omnissa Workspace ONE Launcher collects the following permissions and data:Permissions required to be granted by the user manually:\u00a0a.

Software Development Kit (SDK).\u00a0The Workspace ONE Software Development Kit (\u201cWorkspace ONE SDK\u201d) is a code library that mobile app developers can use to build security, configurations and management capabilities into their own, non-Omnissa mobile applications. Apps that use the Workspace ONE SDK collect and transmit certain data back to Omnissa, such as identity and authentication information and device information as described above, as well as crash reporting data and analytics data as described below. When an app uses the Workspace ONE SDK to provide tunneling functionality, the app also transmits to Omnissa\u2019s systems the URLs of the sites accessed using that tunneling functionality. Developers of third-party apps that use the Workspace ONE SDK also may configure the Workspace ONE SDK to collect other custom data points as they determine in their discretion. This Privacy Disclosure describes only Omnissa\u2019s collection of user data from the Workspace ONE SDK; it does not address the practices of third-party developers that may incorporate the Workspace ONE SDK into their non-Omnissa mobile apps.d. Intel Device Health and Chip to CloudThis section covers Intel Device Health and Chip to Cloud, which are optional add-on features powered by Intel and available for select Workspace ONE SKUs.i. Overview of the Intel Device Health service.\u00a0Intel Device Health (IDH) helps Customers to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Customer systems and information that are accessed by Users from corporate-owned and User-owned laptops. IDH does this by helping to detect threats to the security of those laptops, particularly firmware-related threats. IDH threat analysis information is fed back to the Workspace ONE console where Customers can see and evaluate potential vulnerabilities of enrolled laptops. Customers may use this information to respond to threats by, for example, requiring end users to update their OS.ii. IDH data collection. If IDH is enabled, enrolled laptops send data directly to Intel. Collected data includes information about installed operating system, Intel-based applications, drivers and BIOS; information about the device such as manufacturer, model number, serial number, SKU, and motherboard and CPU details; and country.\u00a0 Intel sends threat analysis results to Omnissa for display in the Workspace ONE console.iii. Use of IDH data by Intel. Intel uses the data collected not only to deliver the IDH threat analysis service, but also to enhance its own threat intelligence and threat detection capabilities. For information about how Intel will use that data, see the\u00a0Intel Privacy Notice.\u00a0iv. Chip to Cloud. Chip to Cloud functionality enables administrators to remotely perform power actions on Intel Active Management Technology (AMT)-enabled managed devices such as Power On, Power Off, Reset, and Power Cycle. Administrators may also remotely access the device to assume KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) control, including seeing the end user\u2019s screen, if the end user provides consent to such remote access at that time.e. Device wipingUEM allows for two different types of device wiping:Enterprise Wipe\u00a0\u2013 An Enterprise Wipe deletes all Customer-Managed Applications and any information stored in the Customer-Managed Applications. Enterprise Wipes will not remove Personal Applications or photos, videos, text messages, or personal email stored in Personal Applications.Full Device Wipe\u00a0\u2013 A Full Device Wipe is a complete full factory reset. Full Device Wipes will remove all data and applications from the device.The Customer\u2019s IT administrator may select which device wiping feature is enabled and can perform these wipes from the Console, either manually or via an automated compliance action. The ability to perform a Full Device Wipe for a device cannot be turned on for a particular device after enrollment, meaning if the setting is off when the User enrolls the device, the Customer cannot perform a Full Device Wipe on a User\u2019s device even if the Customer enables the Full Device Wipe setting in the Console. Depending on the Customer\u2019s configuration, Users may be able to choose to perform an Enterprise Wipe on their devices from the self-service portal.PART II: Omnissa AccessThis section covers\u00a0Omnissa Access\u00a0(formerly Omnissa Identity Manager, \"Access\"), which enables identity and access management as part of the Workspace ONE platform. Omnissa Access use cases include but are not limited to single sign on, multifactor authentication, conditional access, and identity security.a. Overview of Omnissa AccessOmnissa Access combines the User\u2019s identity with factors such as device and network information to make intelligence driven, conditional access decisions for applications delivered by Workspace ONE. Access acts as a broker to other identity stores and providers (such as Active Directory (AD), Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Azure AD, Okta and Ping Identity) that Customers may already be using to enable authentication across on-premises, SaaS, web and native applications without the need to rearchitect the identity environment.b. Collection of User and device data through Accessi. User data.\u00a0Omnissa Access collects data about Users who are using the Workspace ONE platform. Typically, the data is synced from Customer\u2019s directory with certain required attributes, as well as optional attributes that Customers can configure. Required User data that is synced with Access:UsernameEmailFirst and last nameCustomers can customize additional attributes to sync to Access for the purposes of policy creation or application entitlements.ii. Authentication data.\u00a0When Users log in to the Workspace ONE platform using their username and password credentials, Omnissa does not store credentials in Access, but validates Users\u2019 input by reaching out to Customer\u2019s directory that Access has been integrated with, and validating the credentials.In some cases, Access may cache credentials for the duration of User sessions on a User\u2019s device to enable features such as integration with other applications like Omnissa\u00a0Horizon\u00ae or Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops to prevent double prompting when Users launch virtual resources. This functionality can be configured or disabled by Customer\u2019s IT admin using Access.Customers can also enable other authentication methods that do not involve credentials such as certificate-based authentication. To use certificate authentication, Customer IT administrators must upload root certificates and intermediate certificates to the Omnissa Access connector. The certificates are copied to the local certificate store on the User device. These certificates are not replicated in the Omnissa Access database.iii. Logging data.\u00a0Omnissa Access will also generate audit logs for all User activity. For instance, what applications User is launching, time of the launch, authentication methods used, etc. These logs can be retained within Omnissa Access, or they can be sent to Omnissa Intelligence for analytical purposes. For example, User login activity data can be used in Omnissa Intelligence to identify user behavior anomalies and notify the Customer IT administrator. Sending logs to Omnissa Intelligence is configurable and optional functionality.PART III: Omnissa Workspace ONE Hub ServicesThis section covers Workspace ONE Hub Services (\u201cHub Services\u201d), which provide Users with a single destination to access, discover, and connect with corporate resources, applications, teams, and workflows via the Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub application.\u00a0a. Overview of Workspace ONE Hub ServicesHub Services provide a collection of services that are co-located with Omnissa Access and can be deployed On-Prem or as a Hosted Service. Customers can choose to enable one or more Hub Services capabilities:Hub catalog.\u00a0Provides a branded and customized enterprise app store for native, web and virtual Customer apps for discovery and Single-Sign-On access by Users.Notifications.\u00a0Provides personalized push and in-app notifications to Users of Customer communications including system downtimes, survey participation, and updates around enrollments.People.\u00a0Provides employee directory for quick lookup of colleague information along with an organization chart.Custom Tab.\u00a0Provides access to Customer resources through embeddable intranet or company portal within a customizable tab.Support.\u00a0Provides self-service capability for Users to access helpful links and manage their devices.Virtual assistant.\u00a0Provides Users the ability to find answers to common Customer questions, troubleshoot issues and complete workflows like ordering a new device through a chatbot style interaction.b. Collection of User and device data through Hub Servicesi. Authentication.\u00a0Hub Services relies on UEM or Access for user authentication as defined by Customer\u2019s IT administrator in the UEM Console as part of source of authentication configuration.ii. User data.\u00a0Customers can use Hub Service admin console to create and send push notifications to Users. In addition, notifications can be generated based on changes in third-party business systems when integrated via Workspace ONE Mobile Flows. Notification related data generated through Hub Services admin console or Mobile Flows is stored in Hub Services data store. In addition to the notification content, Hub Service collects individual notification acted on state, and target User device identifiers including UUID.Customers can turn on the app rating feature to collect User feedback. When enabled, Hub Services collects User\u2019s external Id and app Id. Customer IT administrators can download a report of aggregated app ratings with following data points: app name, app ID, platform, app version, app type, catalog provider, likes and dislikes. Hub Services does not disclose individual User ratings for different apps to Customer\u2019s IT administrator.When User favorites/unfavorites an app, Hub Services stores app Id favorited/unfavorited by User along with the device type to indicate the platform from which User has favorited/unfavorited the app from.When User searches for a colleague using People tab, Hub Services stores the most recent search result for that User.\u00a0iii. Logging data.\u00a0Workspace ONE Hub Services generates audit logs for User activity. Hub Services logs the source of authentication (UEM or Access), username, external Id and app Id. For instance, app Id is logged: 1) when Users favorites or unfavorites an app; 2) when Users change the order of apps in favorites tab; 3) when install action is invoked on an app; or 4) when apps are launched from Hub Services app.PART IV: Omnissa Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense and Mobile Applications Powered by LookoutThis section covers Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense service (\u201cMTD\u201d), which is an optional feature add-on available for Hub Services and is a Hosted Service powered by Lookout, Inc., including the related mobile applications.\u00a0a.\u00a0Overview of Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense serviceWorkspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense service helps Customers to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Customer systems and information that are accessed by Users from corporate-owned and User-owned devices by helping to detect and protect against threats to the security of those devices. MTD provides the Customer with controls which enable them to respond to threats to enrolled mobile devices. MTD consists of a Customer-specific console, which enables the Customer to monitor threats to its Users\u2019 devices (\u201cConsole\u201d), and software that is installed on a User\u2019s device. The specific features available, and the applicable on-device software application, will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased, how the Customer configures MTD, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) are used by the Users. The Console is hosted by Omnissa\u2019s service provider, Lookout, Inc.\u00a0\u00a0b.\u00a0Console controlsThe specific features and settings available through the Console will depend on the specific version/bundle purchased and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) are used by the Users. Customer can also choose to enable different settings for corporate-owned devices and User-owned devices. In the Console, Customers can customize threat classifications and set their own threat response policies accordingly (e.g., Alert, Warn, Block, etc.). Some of the other options available to Customers are outlined below:\u00a0i. Data collectionCustomer may elect for the Console to maintain a username and email address for each enrolled device, or may elect for the Console to rely solely on a pseudonymized Device ID provided by the UEM platform. With the latter option, Customers\u2019 administrators would need access to the UEM platform to make the association between the device threat data within the Console and the individual User.\u00a0ii. Display of User dataCustomers may elect to redact certain fields within threat data from administrators\u2019 view within the Console. Fields that may be redacted include IP address and resultant geolocation, SSID of suspect networks, name of suspect apps, and suspect or blocked URLs and domains.c.\u00a0Collection of User and device data for MTDUser data that may be collected by MTD varies depending on the specific version/bundle purchased by the Customer, how the Customer configures MTD, and which devices/platforms (i.e., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) and mobile applications are used by the Users. Examples of data collected by MTD are provided below.Device and User identifiersDevice type, name, make, model and manufacturerUsername, email address, IP addressFirmware / OS / Configuration dataInformation about the device\u2019s operating system (including operating system build, version, firmware/kernel versions, configurations, etc.)Various security hygiene details such as developer mode status, whether storage encrypted, whether side loading of apps allowed, whether Bluetooth is enabled, whether lock screen is enabledApplication dataNo user-generated data from within applications is processed or collected (e.g., messages within a messaging app are not processed or collected)For Android devices, a list of installed apps and version details are collected for analysis. If the device is managed using Android\u2019s \u2018Work Profile,\u2019 the analyzed apps may be limited to those in the Work Profile.For iOS devices, the list of installed apps is only collected if Customer configures Workspace ONE UEM to provide such information. Customer may configure Workspace ONE UEM to limit the list to work apps.The name of an app installed on a specific User\u2019s device is only available to the Customer if the app is suspected of posing a threat and if the Customers\u2019 privacy controls permit administrators to see names of suspect apps.App data collected includes SHA-1 hash, Package name, APK file, Bundle ID & Team ID, app/file name, app bundle/package names, application metadataNetwork dataNetwork name (SSID) and network analysis details are collected for suspect WiFi networks only. Whether the suspect SSID is visible to Customer administrators depends on the Customer\u2019s privacy controls.Phishing and Content Protection (PCP) cataData collected includes blocked and suspect URLs and domains, number of URLs and domains checked and number of URLS and domains blocked or detected as suspectURLs and domains that Users click on are processed against lists of suspect and blocked URLs and domains. URLs and domains clicked on are not recorded by MTD unless flagged as suspect or blocked. Block lists are established by Customers.The fact that a User tried to access a blocked or suspect URL or domain, and why the URL or domain was flagged as suspect or blocked, is visible to the Customer Administrators, but the specific blocked or suspect URL or domain is not visible to Customer Administrators.For Android devices, Customers may configure PCP to apply only to URLs and domains clicked on from apps in the \u2018Work Profile.\u2019For iOS devices, no apps bypass PCP; all URLs and domains clicked on are analyzed.PART V: Omnissa Intelligence SoftwareThis section covers\u00a0Omnissa Intelligence\u00a0(\u201cIntelligence\u201d), which is a Hosted Service built for the Omnissa Workspace ONE platform that provides insights, analytics and automation for the entire digital workspace.\u00a0a. Overview of Omnissa IntelligenceOmnissa Intelligence Software provides insights into a Customer\u2019s digital workspace by aggregating and correlating device, application and User data together from multiple data sources in one place to give Customer\u2019s IT administrators a complete view of their entire digital workspace environment. Customers can use reports and dashboards to monitor trends and take actions using the automation feature to mitigate issues. Customers opt-in for Omnissa Intelligence using the UEM console to access the Intelligence console and configure the data sources that Customer wishes to use. Omnissa Intelligence is able to ingest data from the following sources:Workspace ONE UEMOmnissa AccessCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) data from its\u00a0databaseApp Analytics data from Omnissa Intelligence SDKWorkspace ONE Trust Network data from technology partnersb. Collection of User and device data through Omnissa Intelligence Softwarei. Data collection from UEM. UEM data flows to Intelligence only after Customer has opted in. The type of data collected from UEM depend on the privacy controls that the Customer has configured. Refer to the UEM section for details on privacy controls.The Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub app also sends app health, and device health data from corporate-dedicated and corporate-shared Windows devices directly to Intelligence once Customer opts in to this feature in the UEM console. This data may include app crashes, app hang, OS crashes, boot time, logon/shutdown time, windows service start/stop events, sleep and wake events, and device performance monitoring data. This feature is not available for User-owned devices (BYOD).Customers can use this data set to create dashboards and reports to monitor different key performance indices (KPIs) for maintenance and visibility. Customers can also use the automation feature to take actions on devices, and issue notifications.ii. Data collection from Access.\u00a0Customers configure Access integration in Intelligence to allow data from Access to flow into the Intelligence platform. The type of data may include app logon and logout events. Please refer to Access section for details.For example, Customers can use this data set to check User login trend, unique User logins, login failure by authentication method and top 5 apps launched in last week.iii. Data collection from CVE.\u00a0Intelligence retrieves a list of common vulnerabilities and exposure entries from the CVE database. This list includes publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Customers can use this data to measure security threats to their digital workspace and take actions to mitigate issues. Details of these integration and data collection are also provided in Omnissa Intelligence documentation.iv. Data collection from Trust Network technology partners and other technology partners.\u00a0The type of data collected\u00a0or ingested\u00a0by Intelligence depends upon the privacy settings and terms of agreement between Customer and Trust Network technology partners and other partners.\u00a0Workspace ONE Intelligence can integrate with Trust Network technology partners by configuring technology partner\u2019s APIs in Intelligence to ingest data or allowing Customer to create credentials for technology partner to use Intelligence APIs to send data to Intelligence. The type of integration is determined by the Customer.Sample data available in Intelligence from Trust Network and other technology partners may include but is not limited to:Device Unique IDs \u2013 UDID, IP, MAC, Serial NumberEnd user\u2019s nameEmail addressApps detailsNetwork informationApps usage dataSecurity health of devicesIncident data, such as incident data collected by ServiceNow, containing incident ID, description, device name, caller name and email address, and other details.Customers can use this data set to improve visibility across their organization for security threats and take actions using the automation feature to take actions to mitigate the risks.v.
