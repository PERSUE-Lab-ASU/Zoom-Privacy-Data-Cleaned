<h1>Ayoa Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>What this policy covers</h2>

<p>This is the privacy policy of OpenGenius Limited (hereinafter referred to as “<strong>OpenGenius</strong>”). At OpenGenius, your privacy is important to us and OpenGenius does not sell, publish or share any information about our customers with any third party that would use the data for the purpose of marketing non-OpenGenius, third party products, unless given express permission to do so.</p>

<p>Please read this policy carefully. Further information about privacy and data protection issues including the online Register of Data Controllers can be found on the website of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues, at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://ico.org.uk/</a>. OpenGenius is registered on the ICO’s online Register of Data Controllers with registration number Z1521108.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect about you when you use our products or services, or otherwise interact with Ayoa (for example, at an Ayoa event), unless a different privacy policy is displayed.</p>

<p>Our website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.</p>

<p>If you do not agree with this policy, do not access or use our services or interact with any other aspect of our business.</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>We are OpenGenius Limited, a company registered in England and Wales – No. 05653541.</p>

<p>Our registered office is at: <br><br>OpenGenius Ltd., <br>Tec Marina, <br>Terra Nova Way, <br>Penarth, <br>United Kingdom, <br>CF64 1SA. <br><br><a href="/contact-us/">Contact us via email</a></p>

<p>When we refer to “<strong>Ayoa</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, or “<strong>us</strong>” in this policy, we mean OpenGenius Ltd., which controls the information Ayoa collects when you use our services. Ayoa offers collaborative tools, including our web and mobile products, which help you stay productive and organized, as well as interact and communicate with others. We also own and operate several websites and offer related services, like support. We refer to all these products, together with our other services and websites as “<strong>Services</strong>” in this policy.</p>

<h2>Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>

<p>The processing of users’ personal data is necessary to provide the main components of the Services, so contract is our lawful basis for the processing. Before we process any user’s personal data, we offer our terms and conditions which must be accepted as a legally binding agreement between us and the user. The contractual exchange between parties is the Services offered by us, and the subscription payments offered by the subscribers to our Services. Some users intend to enter into a subscription, and agree to our terms and conditions in order to trial the Services before purchase. In the case of users who wish to trial the Services before purchase, the element of exchange offered by the users is the data we use for analysis to improve the Services we offer.</p>

<p>We process the personal data of our users to comply with our obligations under the contract and to carry out what they ask. The processing is necessary for performing the contract, and is a targeted and proportionate way of carrying out the purposes for processing.</p>

<p>Some purposes for processing are non-essential components of the Services. Consent is the lawful basis for processing users’ personal data for the non-essential components of the Services. The non-essential components of the Services include communicating with users for notifications, mentions, reminders, daily summaries, and direct marketing related to the Services. Consent may be given for each non-essential item individually to allow granular control over the processing of users’ personal data.</p>

<h2>Purposes for processing and how we use the information we collect about you</h2>

<p>If you register for an Ayoa account, we will use your information to provide the Services to you. When you register with us or buy from us, the information you provide will be used for the purposes:</p>

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address which we do not link to any personally identifiable information) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for us and providing other services to us relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p></li>

If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, OpenGenius will comply with such restrictions.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sales">Processing personal data belonging to sales leads</h2>

<p>We declare that we carefully and respectfully process personal data belonging to data subjects who we identify as potential customers. In this case, legitimate interests is the legal basis we rely upon to justify the processing of this personal data. When using legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing personal data, we balance our legitimate interests, and the necessity to process the personal data, against the interests, rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned, always considering the particular circumstances.</p>

<p>When relying upon legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing personal data, we always consider the purpose for processing the personal data, to ensure there is a legitimate interest behind the processing. Our purpose and legitimate interests for processing any personal data belonging to potential customers is to communicate with those individuals who we identify as suitable users of our products, to convert them to paying customers, and to increase sales. We also ensure the processing is necessary for the purpose. The processing of personal data is always a proportionate and adequately targeted way of achieving the purpose and is only carried out when no less intrusive alternatives can be identified to achieve the purpose. And we ensure our legitimate interests are balanced against, and not overridden by our data subjects’ interests, rights or freedoms. We always ensure there are no risks to our data subjects’ interests, rights or freedoms which would override our legitimate interests in processing their personal data, taking consideration of physical, financial or any other impact, including the ability to exercise rights, the control over the use of their personal data, and any social or economic advantages. We do not process any highly confidential or sensitive types of data, and do not process special category data, criminal offence data or personal data belonging to children, and our legitimate interests are balanced against the interests, rights and freedoms of the individuals.</p>

<p>Any personal data which we process must only be carried out in a way which satisfies the reasonable expectations of our data subjects, and is not processed in ways the individuals would not reasonably expect. Processing of personal data is carried out in a way which would be expected, to ensure our data subjects can maintain control over the use of their data, and so they are in an informed position to exercise their rights. Where we use legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing any personal data belonging to our data subjects, we always assess and ensure that our data subjects would reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place.</p>

<p>We may not necessarily have a pre-existing relationship with some of our data subjects whose personal data we may process. Whenever we obtain personal data from third parties, we ensure that our data subjects were informed at the time the data was provided that it may be passed for use by other parties, and that we qualify as a suitable party for processing the data, and the processing satisfies reasonable expectations. Whenever data is obtained from other sources, we ensure that our data subjects should reasonably expect their personal data to be available from those sources and that it is reasonably expected that their personal data would be processed in the ways which satisfy our purpose for processing.</p>

<h2>Google User Data</h2>

<p>We support integrations with several Google services and therefore access, collect, use and store information about you that you provide when you register to use Ayoa. The use of this Google user data is limited to the following practices if enabled:</p>

</ul>

<h2> OpenAI AI Beta user Data</h2>

</p>

<h2>How we keep your information secure</h2>

<p>OpenGenius Ltd is ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certified, reflecting our commitment to industry-leading practices in Information Security Management. This certification ensures our adherence to the highest standards for safeguarding customer data.</p>

<p>We keep your information secure by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage. The data for our Services is predominantly hosted on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform within the US. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number to purchase OpenGenius products and services), we encrypt such information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>View more information on our <a href="/security/">security page</a>.</p>

<h2>How long do we keep your information?</h2>

<p>We will only retain your information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your information, the purposes for which we process your information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>

<h2>Access and Control of the data we collect about you</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us in the following ways:</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact-us/" rel="noopener">Contact via email</a>
Postal address: OpenGenius Ltd, Tec Marina, Terra Nova Way, Penarth, CF64 1SA, UK<p></p>

<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the ICO at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ico.org.uk/</a>. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.</p>

<p>You have the right to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”).</em> This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Request the information OpenGenius has stored about you.</em> <a href="/contact-us/">Please contact us</a>. You will not have to pay a fee to access your information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</em> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Request erasure of your personal data.</em> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Delete your account at any time.</em> Follow the steps outlined in our <a href="https://support.ayoa.com/deleting-your-ayoa-account/">support guide</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Object to processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.</em> These circumstances may occur where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.</em> This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
</p><ul>
<li><p>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</p></li>
<li><p>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. </p></li>
<li><p>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p></li>
<li><p><em>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.</em> We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.</em> However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Our policy towards children</h2>

<p>The Services are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact our support services.</p>

<h2>Joint Data Controllers</h2>

<p>For some users of the Services, Ayoa offers a network of carefully selected Partner Affiliates to deliver high quality customer support and communications in an expanding range of languages. Where this service is available, some users may consent to one of our Partner Affiliates being a joint controller of their data. This consent will be given on signing up or subscribing to Ayoa.</p>
