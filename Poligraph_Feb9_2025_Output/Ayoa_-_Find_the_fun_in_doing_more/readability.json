If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, OpenGenius will comply with such restrictions.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"sales\">Processing personal data belonging to sales leads</h2>\n\n<p>We declare that we carefully and respectfully process personal data belonging to data subjects who we identify as potential customers. In this case, legitimate interests is the legal basis we rely upon to justify the processing of this personal data. When using legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing personal data, we balance our legitimate interests, and the necessity to process the personal data, against the interests, rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned, always considering the particular circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>When relying upon legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing personal data, we always consider the purpose for processing the personal data, to ensure there is a legitimate interest behind the processing. Our purpose and legitimate interests for processing any personal data belonging to potential customers is to communicate with those individuals who we identify as suitable users of our products, to convert them to paying customers, and to increase sales. We also ensure the processing is necessary for the purpose. The processing of personal data is always a proportionate and adequately targeted way of achieving the purpose and is only carried out when no less intrusive alternatives can be identified to achieve the purpose. And we ensure our legitimate interests are balanced against, and not overridden by our data subjects\u2019 interests, rights or freedoms. We always ensure there are no risks to our data subjects\u2019 interests, rights or freedoms which would override our legitimate interests in processing their personal data, taking consideration of physical, financial or any other impact, including the ability to exercise rights, the control over the use of their personal data, and any social or economic advantages. We do not process any highly confidential or sensitive types of data, and do not process special category data, criminal offence data or personal data belonging to children, and our legitimate interests are balanced against the interests, rights and freedoms of the individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Any personal data which we process must only be carried out in a way which satisfies the reasonable expectations of our data subjects, and is not processed in ways the individuals would not reasonably expect. Processing of personal data is carried out in a way which would be expected, to ensure our data subjects can maintain control over the use of their data, and so they are in an informed position to exercise their rights. Where we use legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing any personal data belonging to our data subjects, we always assess and ensure that our data subjects would reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place.</p>\n\n<p>We may not necessarily have a pre-existing relationship with some of our data subjects whose personal data we may process. Whenever we obtain personal data from third parties, we ensure that our data subjects were informed at the time the data was provided that it may be passed for use by other parties, and that we qualify as a suitable party for processing the data, and the processing satisfies reasonable expectations. Whenever data is obtained from other sources, we ensure that our data subjects should reasonably expect their personal data to be available from those sources and that it is reasonably expected that their personal data would be processed in the ways which satisfy our purpose for processing.</p>\n\n<h2>Google User Data</h2>\n\n<p>We support integrations with several Google services and therefore access, collect, use and store information about you that you provide when you register to use Ayoa.

We may retain your information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>\n\n<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your information, the purposes for which we process your information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>\n\n<h2>Access and Control of the data we collect about you</h2>\n\n<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us in the following ways:</p>\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ayoa.com/contact-us/\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact via email</a>\nPostal address: OpenGenius Ltd, Tec Marina, Terra Nova Way, Penarth, CF64 1SA, UK</p>\n\n<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the ICO at <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://ico.org.uk/</a>.

In this case, legitimate interests is the legal basis we rely upon to justify the processing of this personal data. When using legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing personal data, we balance our legitimate interests, and the necessity to process the personal data, against the interests, rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned, always considering the particular circumstances.\n\nWhen relying upon legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing personal data, we always consider the purpose for processing the personal data, to ensure there is a legitimate interest behind the processing. Our purpose and legitimate interests for processing any personal data belonging to potential customers is to communicate with those individuals who we identify as suitable users of our products, to convert them to paying customers, and to increase sales. We also ensure the processing is necessary for the purpose. The processing of personal data is always a proportionate and adequately targeted way of achieving the purpose and is only carried out when no less intrusive alternatives can be identified to achieve the purpose. And we ensure our legitimate interests are balanced against, and not overridden by our data subjects\u2019 interests, rights or freedoms. We always ensure there are no risks to our data subjects\u2019 interests, rights or freedoms which would override our legitimate interests in processing their personal data, taking consideration of physical, financial or any other impact, including the ability to exercise rights, the control over the use of their personal data, and any social or economic advantages. We do not process any highly confidential or sensitive types of data, and do not process special category data, criminal offence data or personal data belonging to children, and our legitimate interests are balanced against the interests, rights and freedoms of the individuals.\n\nAny personal data which we process must only be carried out in a way which satisfies the reasonable expectations of our data subjects, and is not processed in ways the individuals would not reasonably expect. Processing of personal data is carried out in a way which would be expected, to ensure our data subjects can maintain control over the use of their data, and so they are in an informed position to exercise their rights. Where we use legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing any personal data belonging to our data subjects, we always assess and ensure that our data subjects would reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place.\n\nWe may not necessarily have a pre-existing relationship with some of our data subjects whose personal data we may process. Whenever we obtain personal data from third parties, we ensure that our data subjects were informed at the time the data was provided that it may be passed for use by other parties, and that we qualify as a suitable party for processing the data, and the processing satisfies reasonable expectations. Whenever data is obtained from other sources, we ensure that our data subjects should reasonably expect their personal data to be available from those sources and that it is reasonably expected that their personal data would be processed in the ways which satisfy our purpose for processing.\n\nGoogle User Data\n\nWe support integrations with several Google services and therefore access, collect, use and store information about you that you provide when you register to use Ayoa.
