When you submit Personal Data via the website, your data is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect Personal Data, that data is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way.

Only employees who need access to the information to perform a specific job are granted access to Personal Data. The computers/servers in which we store Personal Data are kept in a secure environment. While we follow generally accepted standards to protect Personal Data, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices and signing out of websites after your sessions. How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data?\u00a0  We may retain your Personal Data for a period of time consistent with any legal purpose of collection that applies to your interaction with us. We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).\u00a0 After expiration of the applicable retention periods, your Personal Data will be deleted. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of such data.
