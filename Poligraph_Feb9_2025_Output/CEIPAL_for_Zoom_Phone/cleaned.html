<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1)&nbsp;<u>What this Privacy Policy Covers</u></h4>



<p>This Privacy Policy covers how we treat Personal Data that we gather when you access or use our Site. “Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual and also includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules or regulations. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies we don’t own or control or people we don’t manage.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2)&nbsp;<u>What Information Does Ceipal Collect</u>?</h4>



<p><strong>A. Personal Data Collected for Ceipal</strong>‘s<strong> Customers Via Our ATS or WorkForce Platforms (the “Ceipal Services”)</strong></p>



<p>When Ceipal collects and uses Personal Data in the performance of the Ceipal Services for our business customers the following provisions will apply:</p>



<p><em>The Personal Data Collected for Ceipal</em>‘s<em> Customers</em></p>



<p>Ceipal may collect, receive, process, and store Personal Data under the direction of its customers in the course of providing those customers with the Ceipal Services. This Personal Data may include, but is not limited to, Personal Data as your name, phone number, job title, employer name, mailing address, email addresses, and other information identifiable to you such as information one would ordinarily expect to find on a resume. In addition, we collect Personal Data from our customers’ authorized users and account administrators (typically, their employees or agents) in order to provide them with accounts to access the Ceipal Services.&nbsp; This information may include, but is not limited to, credential and profile data (such as name, contact information, employer, job title, and other relevant information).</p>



<p>Ceipal has no direct relationship with the consumers whose Personal Data Ceipal collects in the course of providing the Ceipal Services.&nbsp; All such information is owned and controlled by our customers, who are the data controllers for such information with respect to data protection laws.</p>



<p><em>How We Use the Personal Data Collected by Ceipal</em>‘s<em> Customers</em></p>



<p>Ceipal may use this information for various purposes for the benefit of its customers, including, but not limited to, providing them with contracted Ceipal Services.</p>



<p><em>Access to Personal Data Controlled by Ceipal’s Customers</em></p>



<p>Ceipal has no direct relationship with the consumers whose Personal Data Ceipal receives in the course of providing the Ceipal Services to its customers. An individual consumer who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Personal Data should direct his query to Ceipal’s customer. If the customer then requests Ceipal to correct, amend, or delete the data in Ceipal’s possession or control, we will respond to their request promptly.</p>



<p><em>Retention of Personal Data</em></p>



<p>Ceipal will retain Personal Data we receive in the course of providing the Ceipal Services to our customers for as long as (i) directed by the customers or otherwise agreed to with them, (ii) otherwise needed to provide the Ceipal Services to the customers and (iii) as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="section-10">10)&nbsp;<u>California Resident Rights</u></h4>



<p>If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. Please note that we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers.

<p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:compliance@ceipal.com">compliance@ceipal.com</a>.</p>



<p><em><u>Access</u></em></p>



<p>You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:</p>



<ul>
<li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>



<li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.</li>



<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.</li>



<li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.</li>



<li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
</ul>



<p>If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third-party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data sold to each category of third-party recipient.</p>



<p><em><u>Deletion</u></em></p>



<p>You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Site or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.</p>



<p><em><u>Exercising Your Rights</u></em></p>



<p>To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>



<p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>



<p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p>



<ul>
<li>Call us at: +1-585-296-4563</li>



<li>Email us at:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:compliance@ceipal.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compliance@ceipal.com</a></li>
</ul>



<p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p>



<p><em><u>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</u></em></p>



<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Site as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.</p>



<p><em><u>Other California Resident Rights</u></em></p>

<p>If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.</p>



<p>For this Section 12, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. Ceipal Corp. and its affiliates will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with your use of the Site.</p>



<p>Where applicable, this Section 12 is intended to supplement, and not replace, the other provisions of the Privacy Policy. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:compliance@ceipal.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compliance@ceipal.com</a>.

<p><strong>What do you use the information for?</strong></p>



<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>To personalize your experience</li>



<li>To improve our website</li>



<li>To improve customer service</li>

<p>We use a secure server, so all supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems.<br>After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.</p>



<p><strong>Do you use Cookies?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser that enables the sites’ or service providers’ systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

<li>Protect and defend the rights or property of Ceipal and its family of websites</li>

Both you and Ceipal acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Ceipal’s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.<br><br><em>(a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</em>. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Monroe County, New York. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. <br><br><em>(b) Costs of Arbitration</em>. The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Ceipal will pay all&nbsp;<em>arbitration</em>&nbsp;fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Ceipal will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.<br><br><em>(c) Small Claims Court; Infringement</em>. Either you or Ceipal may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Monroe County, New York or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.<br><br><em>(d) Waiver of Jury Trial</em>. YOU AND Ceipal WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Ceipal are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Ceipal over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND CEIPAL WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.<br><br><em>(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ARISING OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT, ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Ceipal is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.<br><br><em>(f) Opt-out</em>. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 687 Lee Road, Suite 208A, Rochester, NY 14606 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.<br><br><em>(g) Exclusive Venue</em>. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Ceipal to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Ceipal agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Monroe County, New York, or the federal district in which that county falls.<br><br><em>(h) Severability</em>. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Ceipal.</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li><strong>General Information</strong>.&nbsp; The failure of Ceipal to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.&nbsp; If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.&nbsp; You may not assign these Terms or transfer any of your rights or obligations hereunder without Ceipal’s express written consent.&nbsp; These Terms inure to the benefit of Ceipal’s successors, assigns and licensees.&nbsp; These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Ceipal with respect to the subject matter herein.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Anti-Spam Guidance</h2>



<p><strong>A Compliance Guide for Business</strong></p>



<p>Do you use email in your business? The CAN-SPAM Act, a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>



<p>Despite its name, the CAN-SPAM Act doesn’t apply just to bulk email. It covers all commercial messages, which the law defines as “any electronic mail message the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service,” including email that promotes content on commercial websites. The law makes no exception for business-to-business email. That means all email – for example, a message to former customers announcing a new product line – must comply with the law.</p>



<p>Each separate email in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act is subject to penalties of up to $41,484, so non-compliance can be costly. But following the law isn’t complicated. Here’s a rundown of CAN-SPAM’s main requirements:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t use false or misleading header information:</strong>&nbsp;Your “From,” “To,” “Reply-To,” and routing information – including the originating domain name and email address – must be accurate and identify the person or business who initiated the message.</li>



<li><strong>Don’t use deceptive subject lines:</strong>&nbsp;The subject line must accurately reflect the content of the message.</li>



<li><strong>Identify the message as an ad:</strong>&nbsp;The law gives you a lot of leeway in how to do this, but you must disclose clearly and conspicuously that your message is an advertisement.</li>



<li><strong>Tell recipients where you’re located:</strong>&nbsp;Your message must include your valid physical postal address. This can be your current street address, a post office box you’ve registered with the U.S. Postal Service, or a private mailbox you’ve registered with a commercial mail receiving agency established under Postal Service regulations.</li>



<li><strong>Tell recipients how to opt out of receiving future email from you:</strong>&nbsp;Your message must include a clear explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting email from you in the future. Craft the notice in a way that’s easy for an ordinary person to recognize, read, and understand. Creative use of type size, color, and location can improve clarity. Give a return email address or another easy Internet-based way to allow people to communicate their choice to you. You may create a menu to allow a recipient to opt out of certain types of messages, but you must include the option to stop all commercial messages from you. Make sure your spam filter doesn’t block these opt-out requests.</li>



<li><strong>Honor opt-out requests promptly:</strong>&nbsp;Any opt-out mechanism you offer must be able to process opt-out requests for at least 30 days after you send your message. You must honor a recipient’s opt-out request within 10 business days. You can’t charge a fee, require the recipient to give you any personally identifying information beyond an email address, or make the recipient take any step other than sending a reply email or visiting a single page on an Internet website as a condition for honoring an opt-out request. Once people have told you they don’t want to receive more messages from you, you can’t sell or transfer their email addresses, even in the form of a mailing list. The only exception is that you may transfer the addresses to a company you’ve hired to help you comply with the CAN-SPAM Act.</li>



<li><strong>Monitor what others are doing on your behalf:</strong>&nbsp;The law makes clear that even if you hire another company to handle your email marketing, you can’t contract away your legal responsibility to comply with the law. Both the company whose product is promoted in the message and the company that actually sends the message may be held legally responsible.</li>
</ul>



<p>Q. How do I know if the CAN-SPAM Act covers email my business is sending?</p>



<p>A. What matters is the “primary purpose” of the message. To determine the primary purpose, remember that an email can contain three different types of information:</p>



<ul>
<li>Commercial content – which advertises or promotes a commercial product or service, including content on a website operated for a commercial purpose</li>



<li>Transactional or relationship content – which facilitates an already agreed-upon transaction or updates a customer about an ongoing transaction</li>



<li>Other content – which is neither commercial nor transactional or relationship</li>
</ul>



<p>If the message contains only commercial content, its primary purpose is commercial and it must comply with the requirements of CAN-SPAM. If it contains only transactional or relationship content, its primary purpose is transactional or relationship. In that case, it may not contain false or misleading routing information, but is otherwise exempt from most provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act.</p>



<p>Q. How do I know if what I’m sending is a transactional or relationship message?</p>



<p>A. The primary purpose of an email is transactional or relationship if it consists only of content that:</p>



<ul>
<li>Facilitates or confirms a commercial transaction that the recipient already has agreed to</li>



<li>Gives warranty, recall, safety, or security information about a product or service</li>



<li>Gives information about a change in terms or features or account balance information regarding a membership, subscription, account, loan or other ongoing commercial relationship</li>



<li>Provides information about an employment relationship or employee benefits</li>



<li>Delivers goods or services as part of a transaction that the recipient already has agreed to</li>
</ul>



<p>Q. What if the message combines commercial content and transactional or relationship content?</p>



<p>A. It’s common for email sent by businesses to mix commercial content and transactional or relationship content. When an email contains both kinds of content, the primary purpose of the message is the deciding factor. Here’s how to make that determination: If a recipient reasonably interpreting the subject line would likely conclude that the message contains an advertisement or promotion for a commercial product or service or if the message’s transactional or relationship content does not appear mainly at the beginning of the message, the primary purpose of the message is commercial. So, when a message contains both kinds of content – commercial and transactional or relationship – if the subject line would lead the recipient to think it’s a commercial message, it’s a commercial message for CAN-SPAM purposes. Similarly, if the bulk of the transactional or relationship part of the message doesn’t appear at the beginning, it’s a commercial message under the CAN-SPAM Act.</p>



<p>Q. What if the message combines elements of both a commercial message and a message with content defined as “other”?</p>



<p>A. In that case, the primary purpose of the message is commercial and the provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act apply if:</p>



<ul>
<li>A recipient reasonably interpreting the subject line would likely conclude that the message advertises or promotes a commercial product or service; and</li>



<li>A recipient reasonably interpreting the body of the message would likely conclude that the primary purpose of the message is to advertise or promote a product or service.</li>
</ul>



<p>Factors relevant to that interpretation include the location of the commercial content (for example, is it at the beginning of the message) how much of the message is dedicated to commercial content; and how color, graphics, type size, style, etc., are used to highlight the commercial content.</p>



<p>Q. What if the email includes information from more than one company? Who is the “sender” responsible for CAN-SPAM compliance?</p>



<p>A. If an email advertises or promotes the goods, services, or websites of more than one marketer, there’s a straightforward method for determining who’s responsible for the duties the CAN-SPAM Act imposes on “senders” of commercial email. Marketers whose goods, services, or websites are advertised or promoted in a message can designate one of the marketers as the “sender” for purposes of CAN-SPAM compliance as long as the designated sender:<br>Meets the CAN-SPAM Act’s definition of “sender,” meaning that they initiate a commercial message advertising or promoting their own goods, services, or website; is specifically identified in the “from” line of the message; and complies with the “initiator” provisions of the Act – for example, making sure the email does not contain deceptive transmission information or a deceptive subject heading, and ensuring that the email includes a valid postal address, a working opt-out link, and proper identification of the message’s commercial or sexually explicit nature.<br>If the designated sender doesn’t comply with the responsibilities the law gives to initiators, all marketers in the message may be held liable as senders.</p>



<p>Q. My company sends email with a link so that recipients can forward the message to others. Who is responsible for CAN-SPAM compliance for these “Forward to a Friend” messages?</p>



<p>A. Whether a seller or forwarder is a “sender” or “initiator” depends on the facts. So, deciding if the CAN-SPAM Act applies to a commercial “forward-to-a-friend” message often depends on whether the seller has offered to pay the forwarder or give the forwarder some other benefit. For example, if the seller offers money, coupons, discounts, awards, additional entries in a sweepstakes, or the like in exchange for forwarding a message, the seller may be responsible for compliance. Or if a seller pays or gives a benefit to someone in exchange for generating traffic to a website or for any form of referral, the seller is likely to have compliance obligations under the CAN-SPAM Act.</p>



<p>Q. What are the penalties for violating the CAN-SPAM Act?</p>



<p>A. Each separate email in violation of the law is subject to penalties of up to $41,484, and more than one person may be held responsible for violations. For example, both the company whose product is promoted in the message and the company that originated the message may be legally responsible. Email that makes misleading claims about products or services also may be subject to laws outlawing deceptive advertising, like Section 5 of the FTC Act. The CAN-SPAM Act has certain aggravated violations that may give rise to additional fines. The law provides for criminal penalties – including imprisonment – for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Accessing someone else’s computer to send spam without permission.</li>



<li>Using false information to register for multiple email accounts or domain names.</li>



<li>Relaying or retransmitting multiple spam messages through a computer to mislead others about the origin of the message.</li>



<li>Harvesting email addresses or generating them through a dictionary attack (the practice of sending email to addresses made up of random letters and numbers in the hope of reaching valid ones), and taking advantage of open relays or open proxies without permission.</li>
</ul>



<p>Q. Are there separate rules that apply to sexually explicit email?</p>



<p>A. Yes, and the FTC has issued a rule under the CAN-SPAM Act that governs these messages. Messages with sexually oriented material must include the warning “SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT:” at the beginning of the subject line. In addition, the rule requires the electronic equivalent of a “brown paper wrapper” in the body of the message. When a recipient opens the message, the only things that may be viewable on the recipient’s screen are:</p>



<ul>
<li>the words “SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT”; and</li>



<li>the same information required in any other commercial email: a disclosure that the message is an ad, the sender’s physical postal address, and the procedure for how recipients can opt out of receiving messages from this sender in the future.</li>
</ul>



<p>No graphics are allowed on the “brown paper wrapper.” This provision makes sure that recipients cannot view sexually explicit content without an affirmative act on their part – for example, scrolling down or clicking on a link. However, this requirement does not apply if the person receiving the message has already given affirmative consent to receive the sender’s sexually oriented messages.</p>



<p><strong>Email validation</strong></p>



<p>We take our anti-spam policy seriously. Prior to distribution, all email addresses are subject to verification. Our email validation software identifies and removes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Invalid emails from your list to prevent email bounces from ruining your deliverability</li>



<li>Spam traps and known email complainers</li>



<li>Duplicate email addresses.</li>



<li>Inactive email addresses.</li>
</ul>



<p>Your use of Ceipal’s website and services is subject to this policy. Please note that, in accordance with the Ceipal Acceptable Use Policy, we may change this policy at any time. It is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with and comply with this policy.</p>



<p><strong>Unsubscribe Link</strong></p>



<p>Email messages sent from Ceipal must contain an “unsubscribe” link that allows subscribers to remove themselves from your email messages. You acknowledge and agree that you will not hide, disable, or remove or attempt to hide, disable, or remove the opt-out link from the email invitation. You will actively manage and process unsubscribe requests received by you, and update your email lists and address books to reflect the unsubscribe requests.</p>



<p><strong>Email Bounce Statistics &amp; Client Restrictions</strong></p>



<p>Ceipal uses industry-standard metrics to report on how your emails are performing. You can get insights into the number of emails that are valid, how many have been delivered, and how many have been opened. Opens are a great indicator that your emails are engaging your recipients. This shows that the email is interesting enough to a recipient for them to view. CEIPAL strives hard to maintain a 97% delivery rate in most of their email distribution campaigns. However, the results might vary based on the quality of the email address list, type of content, and ISP spam traps of the receivers.</p>



<p><strong>Automatic Global Unsubscribe</strong></p>



<p>A global unsubscribe occurs when a subscriber chooses to unsubscribe from every email sent from Ceipal. Ceipal manages this list, so a subscriber’s status changes to Unsubscribed on the global list when they globally unsubscribe. None of our clients can email that subscriber, regardless from what message they clicked the unsubscribe link.</p>
