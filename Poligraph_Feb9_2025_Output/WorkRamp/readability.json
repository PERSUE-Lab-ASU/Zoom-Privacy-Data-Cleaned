WorkRamp processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with our Customers\u2019 reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in the Data Processing Addendum entered with WorkRamp and other commercial agreements with such Customer.\nOur Customers are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services, and for ensuring that all individuals using the Services on the Customer\u2019s behalf or at their request, as well as all individuals whose personal data may be included in Customer Data processed through the Services have been provided with adequate notice and given informed consent to the processing of their personal data, where such consent is necessary or advised, and that all legal requirements applicable to the processing of Customer Data through our Services are fully met by the Customer, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship.
