COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h3><p>We and our third party service providers use cookies and other similar technologies to track information about your use of our Services.

We also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</li></ul><h3>10.

The storage location(s) are chosen to operate efficiently and improve performance. We take steps to process and protect personal data as described in this statement wherever the data is located.</p><h3>11. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</h3><p style="margin:16px 0 24px 0">This Privacy Policy is effective as of the Effective Date provided above.
