<h2>EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION</h2>
<p>In case of processing of personal data to which the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) is applicable, the information below pursuant to EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR Privacy Notice”) shall apply in addition to the above. In such case, in the event of any conflict between the above and the GDPR Privacy Notice, the provisions of the GDPR Privacy Notice shall prevail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This GDPR Privacy Notice applies to the processing of your personal data by CuraLinc, LLC, a company incorporated and existing under the laws of U.S.A, with its registered office at 314 West Superior Street, Chicago, IL 60654, ID No.: 33-1206383 (“<strong>CuraLinc”</strong> or “<strong>we”</strong>), to which the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, “<strong>GDPR</strong>”) is applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PROCESSORS</h3>
<p>CuraLinc decides why and how your personal data is handled and is therefore the data controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CuraLinc may transfer your personal data to other CuraLinc group companies and companies that provide services to CuraLinc (such as providers of software or IT services) and that work with your personal data as processors. CuraLinc may transfer your personal data to public authorities or other third parties if it is obliged to do so under applicable laws or is permitted to do so by applicable laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your employer will not have access to your personal data stored on CuraLinc systems. However, if your employer offers an incentive plan that offers rewards for completion of CuraLinc’s online programs, with your explicit consent, CuraLinc may share your personal data with your employer including your name, employee identification, and details of which online programs you have completed including the dates. Neither the scores nor responses from your online programs will be disclosed to your employer as part of an incentive plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PROCESSING PURPOSE</h3>
<p>We are working with your personal data to enable you to use CuraLinc’s services and/or platform (employee assistance program), as you decide to use them.</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<h3>PROCESSING LEGAL BASIS</h3>
<p>We work with your personal data based on the following legal titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The processing is necessary for the performance of an agreement to which you are a party, and which governs the terms and conditions of your use of CuraLinc’s services and/or platform (employee assistance program).</li>
<li>In the event you provide us with your personal data relating to your health, such information will be processed based on your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PROCESSING LOCATIONS</h3>
<p>Your personal data will be processed in the USA. Your personal data may also be transferred to another third country (a country outside the EU), including countries that do not guarantee an adequate level of protection of personal data according to the GDPR. For transfers of personal data to third countries that are not covered by the European Commission’s adequacy decision, CuraLinc has taken all necessary measures and safeguards to ensure that personal data is afforded an adequate level of protection as required by applicable law by attaching a standard contractual clause in the wording of the relevant European Commission decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to get more information about the measures and safeguards taken or obtain a copy, please contact us at the contact details below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING</h3>
<p>In relation to your personal data, automated decision-making and profiling may occur to a reasonable extent, to personalize the user experience and provide personalized recommendations. Automated decision-making involves the use of algorithms and computer programs to analyze personal data and make decisions without human intervention. Profiling is a type of automated decision-making that involves analyzing personal Data to make predictions or decisions about an individual. The information we have for you is made up of what you tell us and data we collect when you use our services or from third parties we work with, such as name, address, age, gender and platform engagement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision making or profiling, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you. Our legal basis for using automated decision making is legitimate interest. We comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant laws and regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have the right to restrict or object to us using your personal information or using automated decision-making or profiling. Opting out of automated decision-making and profiling may result in reduced personalization. To exercise these rights or ask questions about our privacy policy see the “Contacting Us” section below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The personal data provided by you will be stored by us for the duration of use of the portal, our services or in the event of the provision of information, services or support until expiry of the applicable statutory storage period, considering the basic principles of the GDPR and the local laws to the permissible extent. With respect to European Union participants, data is retained for three (3) years from the date of case closure.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3>PROCESSING RIGHTS</h3>
<p>As this is guaranteed by the applicable data protection legislation, particularly the GDPR, you may request from us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to your personal data processed by us</li>
<li>Restriction of the processing of your data</li>
<li>Rectification of your data</li>
<li>Erasure of your data</li>
<li>You may object to the data processing</li>
