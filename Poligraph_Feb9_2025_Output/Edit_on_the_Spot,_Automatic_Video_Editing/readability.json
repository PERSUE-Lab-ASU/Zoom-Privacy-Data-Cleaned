Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. You can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the \u201cHelp\u201d section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer ; Microsoft Edge ; Google Chrome ;Mozilla Firefox ; or Apple Safari).

To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li><li><p>Tailored Online Advertising: Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Services may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device to collect information about your use of the Services, in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve advertising content based on past visits to our Services and other sites and (ii) report how our advertising content impressions, other uses of advertising services, and interactions with these advertising impressions and services are related to visits to our Services. We also may allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks, servers and platform) to serve tailored advertising to you on the Services or on other websites or in other mobile applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device you use to access the Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy does not govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed by such third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer or mobile browser to deliver tailored advertising (i.e., not just for the Services), you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out Link and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s WebChoices Tool to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li><li><p>We use Controller Data for business and commercial purposes as follows:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><p>Providing Services: To provide, maintain, and improve the Services, including by analyzing the Services and addressing security and business continuity issues.

It applies to personal information we collect on or through the Services and through other means (such as information collected offline, in person, and over the telephone). It does not apply to personal information we collect from our employees and job applicants in their capacity as employees and job applicants. It also does not apply to personal information we collect from employees, owners, directors, officers, or contractors of businesses in the course of our provision or receipt of business-related services.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li><li><p>As described above, in the preceding twelve months, we or our service providers may have collected the following categories of personal information for business or commercial purposes: (1) identifiers (such as name and email address); (2) commercial information (such as transaction data); (3) Internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history and log data); (4) location information (such as general location information inferred from an IP address); (5) financial data (such as credit card information); (6) sensory information (such as customer service recordings ); (7) professional or employment related data; (8) legally protected classifications (such as gender and marital status if you disclose such information to us); and (9) other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li><li><p>We collect the categories of personal information identified above from the following sources: (1) directly from you; (2) through your use of the Services; and (3) third parties such as lead generation firms.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li><li><p>As further described above, we collect the categories of personal information identified above for the following business and commercial purposes: (1) to provide the Services; (2) to communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you; (3) to protect us and others, including enforcing the legal terms that govern the Services; (4) to comply with laws; (5) to facilitate any business transfers for an actual or contemplated sale involving our assets; and (6) as consistent with customer requirements.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li><li><p>California law may permit California residents to request that we:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><p>Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.</p></li><li><p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</p></li><li><p>Delete certain information we have about you.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information (such as information we collect about our employees or job applicants, or information we collect from employees, owners, directors, officers, or contractors of businesses in the course of our provision or receipt of business-related services) may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li><li><p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request at support@editonthespot.com. You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li><li><p>California residents may opt out of the \"sale\" of their personal information. Edit on the Spot does not \"sell\" your personal information as we understand that term to be defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") and its implementing regulations. However, some people have taken the position that when a website uses third parties' cookies or similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website is engaged in a \"sale\" under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app. Some take this position even when the website pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of providing personal information to the third party. If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a \"sale\" within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Edit on the Spot to have \"sold\" what the CCPA calls \"identifiers\" (like IP addresses), \"internet or other electronic network activity information\" (like information regarding an individual's browsing interactions on the Edit on the Spot site), and \"commercial information\" (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering obtaining services from us) to those sorts of companies. While Edit on the Spot does not believe these are \"sales\" as that term is defined under the CCPA, you can opt out of this activity by following the directions in the section above.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Nevada Rights</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><p>Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. \u201cPersonally identifiable information\u201d includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by support@editonthespot.com. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Children:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><p>Edit on the Spot does not knowingly collect personal information (as defined in the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children\u2019s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on our Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to Edit on the Spot through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p><ul role=\"list\"></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Links to Other Web Sites / Services:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services.

Edit on the Spot does not \"sell\" your personal information as we understand that term to be defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") and its implementing regulations. However, some people have taken the position that when a website uses third parties' cookies or similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website is engaged in a \"sale\" under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app. Some take this position even when the website pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of providing personal information to the third party. If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a \"sale\" within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Edit on the Spot to have \"sold\" what the CCPA calls \"identifiers\" (like IP addresses), \"internet or other electronic network activity information\" (like information regarding an individual's browsing interactions on the Edit on the Spot site), and \"commercial information\" (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering obtaining services from us) to those sorts of companies. While Edit on the Spot does not believe these are \"sales\" as that term is defined under the CCPA, you can opt out of this activity by following the directions in the section above.Nevada RightsUnder Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. \u201cPersonally identifiable information\u201d includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by support@editonthespot.com.
