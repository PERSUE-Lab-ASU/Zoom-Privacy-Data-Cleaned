<li>Details of your visits to our Platform, including traffic data, location data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Platform.</li>
<li>Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile phone or other device. We may collect information regarding and related to your computer or mobile device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information about your use of our Platform, such as date and time. In addition, we may collect information regarding application-level events and associate that with your account to provide customer service.

</ul>
<p>The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cookies (or browser cookies).</b> A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. They are widely used in order to make websites and software applications work, or work in a better, more efficient way. They can do this because websites and software applications can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website or software application more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences). However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Platform. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Platform. (Please refer to our Cookie Policy below for more details.)</li>
<li><b>Web Beacons.</b> Pages of our Platform and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, tracking pixels, or single-pixel gifs) that permit the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not collect Personal Information automatically, but we may tie this information to Personal Information about you that we collect from other sources or you provide to us.</p>
<p><b>How Will We Use Your Data</b></p>
<p>We use the information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any Personal Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To present our Platform and its contents to you.</li>
<li>To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us.</li>
<li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.</li>
<li>To notify you about changes to our Platform, Platform or any products or services we offer or provide through the foregoing.</li>

<li>For any other purpose with your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use your information to contact you about our own and third-parties’ goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please use the unsubscribe button in on your user profile page. For more information, see Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information (below).</p>
<p>We may use the information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements to our advertisers’ target audiences. Even though we do not disclose your Personal Information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria. For more information, see Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information (below).</p>
<p><b>How Do We Store Your Data</b></p>
<p>The Company securely stores your data on servers we own or lease from a reputable third-party hosting service located within the United States. Data is retained in accordance with the Company’s User Agreement.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depend on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to our Platform. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Platform.</p>
<p><b>Data Retention and Deletion</b></p>
<p>The Company retains user profile, transactions, and other information for as long as a user maintains their account.</p>
<p>Users may request the deletion of their accounts at any time. Following such requests, the Company deletes the data that it is not required to retain for purposes of regulatory, tax, insurance, litigation, or other legal requirements. For example, the Company retains location, device, and usage data for these purposes for a minimum of 7 years; while it retains such data, it may also use it for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention and detection, and research and development. In certain circumstances, the Company may be unable to delete a User’s account, such as if there’s an outstanding credit on the account or an unresolved claim or dispute. Upon resolution of the issue preventing deletion, the Company will delete the account as described above.</p>
<p>The Company may also retain certain information indefinitely, if necessary, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention. For example, if the Company deactivates a User’s account because of unsafe behavior or security incidents, the Company may retain certain information about that account to prevent that user from opening a new account in the future.</p>
<p><b>Data Usage and Processing</b></p>
<p>We collect and use personal data only where we have one or more lawful grounds for doing so. Such grounds may vary depending on where our Users are located, but generally include processing personal data:</p>
<ol>
<li>To provide requested services and features.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to provide our services, we must collect and use certain personal data. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>User profile data, which we use to establish and maintain User accounts; verify User identity; communicate with Users about their orders and accounts; and enable Users to make or receive payments (as and if applicable)</li>
<li>Usage data, which is necessary to maintain, optimize, and enhance the Platform</li>
<li>Transaction information</li>
<li>Information relating to customer support</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>For purposes of the legitimate interests of the Company or other parties.</li>
</ol>
<p>This includes using personal data to maintain and enhance our Users’ safety and security. For example, we use personal data to prevent use of our Platform by Users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous behavior.</p>
<p>This also includes purposes such as combating fraud; improving our Platform, direct marketing, research, and development; and enforcing the Company’s User Agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, it includes using personal data to the extent necessary for the interests of other people or the general public, such as in connection with legal or insurance claims, and to protect the rights and safety of others.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>To fulfill the Company’s legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
</ol>
<p>We collect and use personal data to comply with applicable laws. The Company may also share data with law enforcement regarding criminal acts or threats to public safety, or requests by third parties pursuant to legal processes. The Company also uses personal data to verify the identity of both users and cardholders in order to comply with federal banking regulations.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>With consent.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Company may collect and use personal data based on the User’s consent. For example, we may collect personal data through voluntary surveys. Responses to such surveys are collected on the basis of consent and will be deleted once no longer necessary for the purposes collected.</p>
<p>A User who has provided consent to the collection or use of their personal data can revoke it at any time. However, the User will not be able to use any Service or feature that requires the collection or use of that personal data.</p>
<p><b>Data Sharing and Disclosure</b></p>
<p>We are required by various state or governmental entities to describe disclosures with specific language. <b>Click &amp; Pledge</b><b><sup>®</sup></b><b> </b>has never sold and will never sell personal data of our customers or their donors for any reason. We provide such data to reputable third parties for the sole purpose of facilitating the electronic processing of payments. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We may disclose aggregated information about our Users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.</p>
<p>We may disclose Personal Information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:</p>
