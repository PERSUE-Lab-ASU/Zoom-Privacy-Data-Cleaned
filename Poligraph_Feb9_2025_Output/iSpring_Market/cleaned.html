	 iSpring respects your right to privacy and we understand that, when you visit our websites and use our products and services or otherwise interact with us (for example, by viewing our webinars), you prefer to control the way you share your personal information (“Personal Data”  as defined below) and preferences. iSpring offers a wide range of products, including desktop products, web-based services, custom, and support services. We refer to all of these software products, together with our other services and websites, as “Services” in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
	 For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “iSpring,” “us,” “we,” and “our” mean either iSpring Group FZCO, the United Arab Emirates company, or a company indicated on the <a href="https://www.ispringsolutions.com/company">Company page</a>, as the case may be.
</p>
<p>
        The terms “user,” “you,” and “your” refer to Sites visitors, customers and any other users of the Sites and the Services. For more information about iSpring companies please visit the company <a href="https://www.ispringsolutions.com/company">page</a>.
</p>

<p>
        The term “Personal Data” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual.
</p>
<p>
       iSpring collects, stores, uses and discloses the following categories of Personal Data:
</p>
<p>
        (1)  Customer Data: Personal Data concerning our business customers’ (“Customers”) internal focal persons who directly engage with iSpring concerning their organizational account, and users of the Services on behalf of such Customers, e.g., the account administrators and users, billing contacts and authorized signatories on behalf of the Customer; as well as the Customer’s business needs and preferences, as identified to us or recognized through our engagement with them;
</p>
<p>
       (2) User Data: Personal Data that we process and manage on behalf of our Customers, as part of our Services.
</p>
<p>
        We process such User Data on behalf of and under the instruction of the respective Customer, in accordance with our <a href="https://www.ispringsolutions.com/data-processing-agreement">Data Processing Agreement</a> with them. Accordingly, this Privacy Policy (which describes iSpring’s privacy and data processing practices) does not apply to such processing done on its Customers’ behalf.

	 iSpring have developed this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to ensure you understand how we collect, use, disclose, and store your Personal Data. The Policy applies to your interactions with iSpring websites which receive data and are linking to this Privacy Policy (the “Sites”). It does not apply to iSpring Sites that do not display or linked to this Privacy Policy or that have their own privacy policy. It also does not apply to iSpring services and products unless they are linking to this Privacy Policy.

When Customers and iSpring partners use iSpring web-based services to process Personal Data in their content, iSpring acts as a data processor.

 <b>Legal ground for processing</b>
</p>
<p>
	 If you are an individual located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the European Union (EU), Switzerland or the United Kingdom, we collect and process information about you only where we have legal grounds for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal ground depends on the Services you use and how you use them. To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal bases:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
 <b><i>Performance of a contract:&nbsp;</i></b>the use of your information is necessary to provide you the Services, customer support, and personalized features. If you order and use our Services, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that Services under the contract that we have with you;
	</p>
 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
 <b><i>Legitimate interests:</i></b>&nbsp;the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, namely for information security. We also want to provide you with the best suitable content of the website, to improve and promote our products and services and the content on our website, and for administrative, fraud detection and legal purposes;
	</p>
 </li>

<p id="howWeStore">
 <b>How we store and secure information we collect</b>
</p>
<p>
 <b><i>Information storage.&nbsp;</i></b>We use data hosting service providers in the United States, Ireland and Germany to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.
</p>
<p>
 <b><i>Technical and organizational security procedures and data transfers.&nbsp;</i></b>We observe reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized access to and the misuse of your Personal Data. We use appropriate business systems and procedures to protect and safeguard your Personal Data. We also use security procedures and technical and physical restrictions for accessing and using the Personal Data on our servers. Only authorized personnel are permitted to access Personal Data in the course of their work.

 <b>How long we keep information (retention procedures)</b>
</p>
<p>
	 iSpring will store your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary in order to maintain and expand our relationship and provide you with our Services and offerings; in order to comply with our legal and contractual obligations; or to protect ourselves from any potential disputes (i.e. as required by laws applicable to log-keeping, records and bookkeeping, and in order to have proof and evidence concerning our relationship, should any legal issues arise following your discontinuance of use), all in accordance with our data retention policy and this Policy. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
</p>
<p>
	 To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and the applicable legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
	If you have any questions about our data retention policy, please contact us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:support@ispring.com">support@ispring.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
 <b><i>Site account information:&nbsp;</i></b>We retain your site account information for as long as your site account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.
</p>
<p>
 <b><i>Information you share on the Services:&nbsp;</i></b>If your site account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display the content you provided.
</p>
<p>
 <b><i>Managed accounts:&nbsp;</i></b>If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.
</p>
<p>
 <b><i>Marketing information:&nbsp;</i></b>If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your iSpring site account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.
</p>
<p>
 <i><b>Information you provide using the Zoom Apps features and functionality.</b></i>&nbsp;During integration with the Zoom App, iSpring retains the following information:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		 Zoom access keys
	</p>
 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		 Zoom event IDs
	</p>
 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		 at the end of an event, we request statistics on users who have attended the event.
	</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	 When the integration with the&nbsp;Zoom Apps&nbsp;is disabled, iSpring does not delete the event attendance statistics (except access keys and event identifiers) that is associated with users in iSpring web services, and could have been modified by iSpring system administrator. iSpring retains these statistics to ensure the integrity of Your account within iSpring web services. You can delete these data using&nbsp;iSpring web services administrator panel.
</p>
<p>
	 iSpring Web Services do not require an email address for registration for a webinar when You use the Zoom Webinar App. For Your convenience, iSpring transmits a special pregenerated email address to the Zoom Webinar App when you register for an event, which acts as a substitute for your real email address. Thus, connecting the integration through iSpring Web Services does not require Your (or end users’) email addresses, and iSpring also does not transfer Your email addresses to third parties.
