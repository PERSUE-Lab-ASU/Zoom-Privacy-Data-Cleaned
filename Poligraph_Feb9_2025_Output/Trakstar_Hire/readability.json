All sensitive information is treated as confidential; any unauthorized collection, processing, or use of such data is prohibited. In the context of increasingly flexible company organization, it must be ensured that employees have access to sensitive data on a need-to-know basis only. The need-to-know principle means that employees may have access to sensitive information only as is appropriate for the type and scope of the task in question.

If this does not occur owing to a legal obligation, it must be checked in each instance whether it is in conflict with any interest of the data subject that merits protection. If the recipient is located in a third country, he/she must guarantee an adequate level of data protection in line with this statement.
