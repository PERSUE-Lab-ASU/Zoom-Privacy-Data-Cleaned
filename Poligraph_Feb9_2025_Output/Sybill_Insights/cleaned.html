Data Sharing</strong>‍</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong>: In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your Personal Data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b) disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such disclosure is required to protect our legitimate business interests, including the security or integrity of our products and services</li><li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may engage selected third party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own. Such service providers include hosting and server co-location services, communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), speech-to-text services, expression analytics, data and cyber security services, billing and payment processing services, fraud detection and prevention services, web analytics, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, social and advertising networks, content providers, e-mail, voicemails, support and customer relation management systems, and our legal, financial and compliance advisors (collectively, “Service Providers“).</li><li>Our Service Providers shall each be deemed as a ‘data processor’ or ‘service provider’ in circumstances where Sybill assumes the role of ‘data controller’; and where Sybill acts as the ‘data processor’ or ‘service provider’ for our customer, the Service Provider shall be deemed as our ‘sub-processor’ or ‘service provider’ (as further described in Section ‎10 below).</li><li>Accordingly, these Service Providers may have access to Sybill User Data and Website, CRM &amp; Prospect Data; and if we have expressly listed them in our Sub-Processor List, they may also have access to Customer Data — all depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services, and may only use it for such limited purposes as determined in our agreements with them.</li><li>When our Service Providers contact you in order to offer or promote our Services, they may additionally interest you in their own services. Should you decide to engage in such activities with the Service Provider, please note that such engagement is beyond the scope of Sybill’s Terms and Privacy Policy and will therefore be covered by our Service Provider’s Terms and Privacy Policy.</li><li><strong>Third Party Websites and Services</strong>: Our Sites and Platform may include links to third party websites, and integrations with third party services. Such websites and third party services, and any information you process, submit, transmit or otherwise use with such websites and third party services, are governed by such third party’s terms and privacy practices and policies, and not by this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to carefully read the terms and privacy policies of such website and third party services.</li><li><strong>Sharing Personal Data with our Customers and other Users</strong>: Customer Data is typically shared and is available to the users belonging to such customer’s account. Sybill User Data is shared with the administrator of the customer’s account to which such user belongs (including data and communications concerning such user’s account). In such cases, sharing such data means that the administrator(s) or other users of the same account may access it on behalf of the customer, and will be able to monitor, process and analyze the Personal Data contained therein. This includes instances where you may contact us for help in resolving an issue specific to a team of which you are a member (and which is managed by the same customer).</li><li>Please note that Sybill is not responsible for and does not control any further disclosure, use or monitoring by or on behalf of the customer, that itself acts as the ‘data controller’ of such data (as further described in Section ‎‎10 below).</li><li><strong>Protecting Rights and Safety</strong>: We may share Personal Data with others if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of Sybill, any of our users or customers, or any members of the general public.</li><li><strong>Sybill Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies</strong>: We may share Personal Data internally within our group, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, should Sybill or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates undergo any change in control or ownership, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all or part of its assets, Personal Data may be shared with or transferred to the parties involved in such an event. If we believe that such change in control might materially affect your Customer Data or Personal Data then stored with us, we will notify you of this event and the choices you may have via e-mail or prominent notice on our Services.</li><li>For the avoidance of doubt, Sybill may share Sybill User Data, Website, CRM &amp; Prospect Data in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal, non-identifiable and anonymous. We may transfer, share or otherwise use non-personal and non-identifiable data at our sole discretion and without the need for further approval.</li></ul><p><strong>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies for performance, tracking, analytics and personalization purposes. We may share non-identifiable / aggregated extracts of such information with our partners for our legitimate business purposes.</li><li>Cookies are packets of information sent to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the server that sent the cookie. Some cookies are removed when you close your browser session. These are the “Session Cookies”. Some last for longer periods and are called “Persistent Cookies”. We use both types.</li><li>We use Persistent Cookies to remember your log-in details and make it easier for you to log-in the next time you access the Platform.

Communications</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We engage in service and promotional communications, through e-mail, phone, SMS and notifications.</li><li>Service Communications: We may contact you with important information regarding our Services. For example, we may send you notifications (through any of the means available to us) of changes or updates to our Services, billing issues, service changes, log-in attempts or password reset notices, etc. Our customers, and other users on the same customer account, may also send you notifications, messages and other updates regarding their or your use of the Services. Such notifications and messages may also be sent by them to their own customers (for example, invites, recordings or meeting summaries created through our Services). You can typically control your communications and notifications settings from your Sybill User profile settings, or otherwise in accordance with the instructions included in the communications sent to you. Please note that you will not be able to opt-out of receiving certain service communications which are integral to your use (like password resets or billing notices).</li><li>Promotional Communications: We may also notify you about new features, additional offerings, events, special opportunities or any other information we think you will find valuable, as our customer, user or prospect. We may provide such notices through any of the contact means available to us (e.g. phone, mobile or e-mail), through the Services, Platform or Sites, or through our marketing campaigns on any other sites or platforms.</li><li>If you do not wish to receive such promotional communications, you may notify Sybill at any time by sending an e-mail to: privacy@sybill.ai, changing your communications preferences in your User Profile settings, or by following the “<strong>unsubscribe</strong>”, “<strong>stop</strong>”, “<strong>opt-out</strong>” or “<strong>change e-mail preferences</strong>” instructions contained in the promotional communications you receive.</li></ul><p><strong>8. Data Security</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We and our hosting services implement systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal data, to minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information.</li><li>These measures provide sound industry standard security. However, although we make efforts to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that our Sites, Platform or Services will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.</li></ul><p><strong>9. Data Subject Rights</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Individuals have the right to access, delete or transfer their Personal Data that we have collected and retained. To exercise these rights, individuals may contact us at privacy@sybill.ai. We will respond to all data access, deletion, and transfer requests in a timely manner, and we will take all necessary steps to comply with the request, subject to any legal or contractual obligations that may limit our ability to do so. If you are a customer of ours, we may require further information or clarification to verify your identity and to ensure that we are responding to the correct person. In order to help us comply with your request, please provide as much information as you can about the specific data you are seeking and the context in which it was provided.</li><li>In addition, we will provide customers with a mechanism to access, delete or transfer their Personal Data through our platform, if this is feasible from a technical and operational standpoint. If it is not feasible, we will provide individuals with an explanation for the same.</li><li>Please note that when you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal information related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access. Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g. as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section ‎‎4 above.</li><li>We may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data related to others.</li><li>If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data that we process on our customer’s behalf, please contact the administrator of such customer’s account directly. For example, if you are our customer’s customer or prospect, or if you are a user of Sybill on behalf of our customer, and wish to access, correct, or delete data processed by Sybill on behalf of our customer, please direct your request to the relevant customer (who is the “data controller” of such data – see Section ‎‎10 below). Note that if you do contact us, we may share your communications with our customer and its account users; and that we may also share the contact details of the account administrator with individuals who sent us such a request or query relating to this account.</li></ul><p><strong>10. Data Controller/Processor</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the “data controller” (or under the CCPA, “business”), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “data processor” (or under the CCPA, “service provider”), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.</li><li>Sybill is the “data controller” of Sybill Website, CRM &amp; Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of the data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of “data processor”.</li><li>Sybill is the “data processor” of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the “data controller” of such data; and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the “sub-processors” of such data.</li><li>Sybill is both a “data controller” and “data processor” of Sybill User Data. Such data is processed by Sybill for its own purposes (as described in Section ‎2 above), as an independent ‘controller’; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customer’s behalf, as a ‘processor’.</li><li>Accordingly, Sybill processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with such customer’s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer. The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).</li><li>For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data – including sufficient reference to the processing of their Personal Data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.</li></ul><p><strong>11. Additional Notices</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Updates and Amendments</strong>: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version of our Services. The amended version will be effective as of the date it is published.

After such notice period, all amendments shall be deemed accepted by you.</li><li><strong>External Links</strong>: While our Sites, Platform and/or Services may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for their privacy practices.
