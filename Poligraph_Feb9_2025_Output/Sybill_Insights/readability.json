Data Controller/ProcessorCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201cdata controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the \u201cdata processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.Sybill is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of Sybill Website, CRM & Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of the data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cdata processor\u201d.Sybill is the \u201cdata processor\u201d of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data; and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201csub-processors\u201d of such data.Sybill is both a \u201cdata controller\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d of Sybill User Data. Such data is processed by Sybill for its own purposes (as described in Section \u200e2 above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019; whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.Accordingly, Sybill processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with such customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer. The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data \u2013 including sufficient reference to the processing of their Personal Data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.11.
