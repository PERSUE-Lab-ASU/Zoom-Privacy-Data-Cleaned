How We Use Customer Data</h4><p>The privacy, confidentiality and security of your Customer Data is important to us.</p><p><strong>Customer/Authorized Users Access to Customer Data</strong></p><p>All Storms are private and available only to Authorized Users that have been specifically invited to them. The Customer or other members of your team do not automatically gain access to all Storms, and that Storm\u2019s Customer Data belonging to your team, and must be invited to each Storm individually. Enterprise Customers have access to additional privacy and Storm access settings to further prevent access to Storms.</p><p>The Customer has the right to take any action they deem appropriate including transferring, modifying, and/or deleting a Storm or Customer Data that an Authorized User has contributed.</p><p>If the Customer is your employer and/or your Stormboard account is registered using your corporate email domain, that organization has the right to replace you as the Customer.

After these sessions, we remove ourselves from the Storm and to regain access requires a new invite.</p><p>Stormboard will use and process the Customer Data to provide the Services. Customer Data will be used by Stormboard in accordance with the Customer\u2019s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Terms of Use, Customer Terms of Service and Customer\u2019s use of Services, and as required by applicable law.</p><p>Stormboard is a processor of Customer Data and the Customer is the controller.
