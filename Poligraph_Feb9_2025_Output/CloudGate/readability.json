This information is encrypted and stored on your device or with your consent and on your secure personal cloud for high availability purposes and is not disclosed to our servers in cleartext. When you choose to share this data with third parties, it passes through our servers only in hashed, encrypted, and digitally signed form. The original data is thus undecipherable by Soloinsight.</p>\n\n                    <p>We further protect the PII shared with one of our customers by your consent by keeping it encrypted and provisioned to avoid unauthorized access from such Customer\u2019s employees or third-party contractors that the customer engages with; by limiting the access to such information only to privileged admin accounts requiring multi-factor authentication and device provisioning.</p>\n\n                    <p>However, if you are an employee or visitor of one of our customers, you should always review the policies of our customers to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they collect and use your information.</p>\n\n                    <p>If you are an employee of one of our customers and would no longer like us to process your information, please contact your employer.</p>\n\n                    <p>If you are providing information (including Personal Information) about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            <p><strong>Content:&nbsp;</strong> We collect and store Content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our SaaS Products or Websites.

Information We collect from use of Google Services\n                    Expanding the functionality of the CloudGate visitor management system, integration with Google Calendar is also feasible. To enable this feature, CloudGate requires a two-way syncing mechanism. This ensures that the visitor invitations generated within our system are mirrored on Google Calendar, and vice versa. To facilitate the documentation of visitor invitation particulars, Soloinsight needs to gather certain sensitive information from users: their name, and email address.\n                        \n                        By authorizing us to establish a connection with Google API Services, you authorize our access to process and store your name, your email address, name and email addresses of visitors, and your calendar data. This access and usage are bound by the terms outlined in Soloinsight's Privacy Policy.\n                        \n                        You should check your privacy settings on these third-party services to understand and change the information sent to us through these services.\n                    \n                    9.
