However, like many companies, we may use advertising and analytics services that are intended to analyze your interactions with our website or app, based on information obtained from cookies or other trackers, including for delivering advertising to you (such as interest-based, targeted, or cross-context behavioural advertising). You can get more information and opt out of the use of cookies and other trackers on our website and app by clicking the Do Not Sell My Personal Information link, also on our homepage, and setting your preferences. You will need to set your preferences from each device and each web browser from which you wish to opt out. This feature uses a cookie to remember your preference, so if you clear all cookies from your browser, you will need to re-select your preferred settings. California residents may also set the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt out of the \u201csale\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of your personal information for each participating browser system that you use.

No Retaliation Following Opt Out or Exercise of Other Rights \u2013 Non-Discrimination InstaVC will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights, which is further in line with your rights under state law. Sensitive Information. InstaVC receives information that may be considered sensitive under some state laws, such as certain Account Information (e.g., financial information, log-in information) , certain Content and Context from Meetings, Webinars, Messaging, and Other Collaborative Features and certain Limited Information from InstaVC Email and Calendar Services (e.g., messaging content in cases described herein) InstaVC processes sensitive personal information to provide InstaVC products and services, for product research and development, for authentication, integrity, security, and safety reasons, to communicate with you, for legal reasons, and with your consent. InstaVC does not use or disclose sensitive personal information (as defined under CCPA) for purposes of inferring characteristics about a consumer, or in any way that would require InstaVC to provide a right to limit under the CCPA. Under certain laws, residents may also be permitted to opt out of certain profiling relating to automated processing analyzing certain categories of an individual\u2019s information that would produce a legal or similarly significant effect. InstaVC does not engage in this type of profiling of individuals. To opt out of the use of cookies on our sites for interest-based advertising purposes, follow the instructions above. Response Timing and Format We will acknowledge receipt of your request within 10 business days, and provide a substantive response within 45 calendar days, or inform you of the reason and extension period (up to a total of 90 days) in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request\u2019s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. These rights are not absolute, are subject to exceptions and limitations, and may not be afforded to residents of all states. In certain cases, we may decline requests to exercise these rights where permitted by law. We will need to verify your identity to process your access, deletion, and correction requests and reserve the right to confirm your state residency. To verify your identity, we may require you to log into your existing InstaVC account (if applicable), give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information, such as providing at least two pieces of personal information relating to your account (which will be compared to information we have, such as profile information) or as we otherwise may already have in our possession, such as your email address and phone number. We will verify your consumer request by comparing the information you provide to information already in our possession, and take additional steps to minimize the risk of fraud. You may designate an authorized agent to submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney.
