In the following sections, we will outline the details of what we collect and how:</p><h3 data-styles-preset=\"vc_IlHyte\">Information You Provide</h3><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">When you sign up, we create an account for you on our servers (\u201cAccount\u201d) to access our Services. We will store information such as your first name, last name, job title, department and email address.</p><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">Fellow\u2019s primary objective is to help you manage your work relationships through the logging of discussions, feedback, goals/priorities and more with others that you work with (whether individually or in groups). Fellow also offers smart suggestions on what actions you may want to take in order to optimize these relationships (for example, \u201cyou should ask for feedback from someone in particular\u201d). In order to provide such suggestions, we need to compute a \u201cwork-graph\u201d that will give us insights into the people that you work with and how often you work with them. In order to offer these Services, we require access to the following information:</p><ul data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\"><li><p>Calendar: We access data about the events that you participate in such as organizer, title, attendees and optional attendees (names and emails), date, time, duration, calendar resources (meeting rooms) and recurrence of events.</p></li></ul><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">Once you sign up, we may ask you more information including your job title, department, who your manager is and whether you have a 1on1 with this manager and which calendar event this corresponds to. We also provide the opportunity for you to invite other individuals into the platform so that you may collaborate with them (in order to invite others, we may ask you for some further information about those Users including their name, email address and reporting relationship with you).</p><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">Your main interactions with Fellow will either directly through our Platform, one of our communications platform apps, or via one of our integrations.. Users on the system will be able to collaborate on notes in relation to 1:1 and group meetings, goals/priorities and request feedback from one another and provide feedback to each other. The content created by these Users will be stored and accessible through the Services. This information is by default only accessible to Users who were part of the interactions and is not accessible by managers of the company (unless those that were part of the feedback interactions explicitly share such feedback with others such as managers). Metadata about the interactions (such as stats on usage) will be available to managers. The only exception to this rule will be if the policies of the Organization require us to share this information upon request from the Organization.</p><h3 data-styles-preset=\"vc_IlHyte\">Information Collected through Systems</h3><h4 data-styles-preset=\"aRXLY1cWf\">Servers</h4><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">Our servers (hosted by Amazon Web Services) collect information including the type of browser and O/S you use, your IP Address, domain name and the timing / duration of your visit to our Site. This information is collected to make our Services more useful to you.</p><h4 data-styles-preset=\"aRXLY1cWf\">Logs</h4><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">We record some information from your interactions with our Services automatically in our logs. This data includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. This information is used to analyze trends and usage patterns all in an effort to better tailor our Services to your needs.</p><h4 data-styles-preset=\"aRXLY1cWf\">Cookies</h4><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">Fellow and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track Users\u2019 movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">We use \u201ccookies\u201d to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Websites, or register for the Services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.</p><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Fellow Services when you visit. Fellow keeps track of the pages you visit within Fellow, in order to determine what portion of the Fellow Services is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the Fellow Services to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p><h4 data-styles-preset=\"aRXLY1cWf\">Pixel Tags</h4><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">We use \u201cClear Gifs\u201d also known as \u201cPixel Tags\u201d similar to cookies to track the usage of our Services by Users.

An example common use case is to use this technology to understand the open-rate of emails that we send to you. Ultimately, like cookies, we use this tool as another method to customize our offerings for our customers.</p><h4 data-styles-preset=\"aRXLY1cWf\">Analytics Software and Advertising Platforms</h4><p data-styles-preset=\"sLGIopf9N\">We use some analytics services from third party vendors such as Google Analytics in order to analyze usage of our Services.

Fellow also offers smart suggestions on what actions you may want to take in order to optimize these relationships (for example, \u201cyou should ask for feedback from someone in particular\u201d). In order to provide such suggestions, we need to compute a \u201cwork-graph\u201d that will give us insights into the people that you work with and how often you work with them. In order to offer these Services, we require access to the following information:Calendar: We access data about the events that you participate in such as organizer, title, attendees and optional attendees (names and emails), date, time, duration, calendar resources (meeting rooms) and recurrence of events.Once you sign up, we may ask you more information including your job title, department, who your manager is and whether you have a 1on1 with this manager and which calendar event this corresponds to.
