<p class="css-1mglt86">Welcome to the website of Playbook Software Inc. ("Rollout", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This website is operated by Rollout and has been created to provide information about our company and its content and data automation platform and related services (together with the website, the "Service(s)") to our Service visitors ("you", "your"). “Personal Data” means any information relating to, or which can reasonably be ascribed to an identified or identifiable natural person. There are from two (2) classes of users possibly impacted by the Service: Administrators for entities that contract with us or that might be interested in contracting with us (“Partners”) and the persons that Partners may collect information or data on that are in their Services (“Users”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Rollout's policy with respect to "Personal Data" that is collected from visitors to the website and Services.</p>
<h2 data-group="" id="note-to-users" class="css-1j8e6vd"><span class="content">Note to Users</span><a aria-label="anchor" href="#note-to-users" class="css-118i9km">#</a></h2>
<p class="css-1mglt86">Our Service allows Partners to create automated workflows, sometimes using APIs. While a Partner may have access to User Personal Data and use our Service to work with it as it is stored with them and their other processors and transmit and store it through our Service. We do not control Partner use of the Personal Data they collect from you and provide to us.</p>
<p class="css-1mglt86">Partners may store and transmit information using the Service which may include:</p>
<ul class="css-1e61r82">
<li class="css-b0qdn7">name, email address, physical address, phone number, and other similar contact information;</li>
<li class="css-b0qdn7">payment information, including credit card and bank account information;</li>
<li class="css-b0qdn7">information about location;</li>
<li class="css-b0qdn7">information about a User organization and contacts, such as colleagues or people within your organization;</li>
<li class="css-b0qdn7">usernames, aliases, roles, and other authentication and security credential information;</li>
<li class="css-b0qdn7">content of feedback, testimonials, inquiries, support tickets, and any phone conversations, chat sessions and emails with or to us;</li>
<li class="css-b0qdn7">images (still, video, and in some cases 3-D), voice, and other identifiers that are personal.</li>
<li class="css-b0qdn7">information regarding identity, including government-issued identification information;
corporate and financial information; and</li>
<li class="css-b0qdn7">VAT numbers and other tax identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="css-1mglt86">If you are a User and desire to exercise any of your rights with respect to your Personal Data, please contact the Partner directly as we will cooperate with them with respect to any lawful request.</p>
<p class="css-1mglt86">Our Service also allows Users to create automated workflows, sometimes using UI Components. For Workflow Content (content transferred in and out of automated workflows in your Partner account), you, the User, are considered the “data controller” of that data from a privacy perspective.</p>
<p class="css-1mglt86">In turn, Rollout is the “data processor” responsible for safeguarding Workflow Content as it flows through Rollout's systems. Rollouts’s security measures are described in Rollouts’s <a href="/security-and-legal/security" class="css-2tbrfl">Security</a> page.</p>
<p class="css-1mglt86">As data controller, you are responsible for safeguarding Workflow Content as you interact directly with services integrated with Rollout. You should configure your Workflows and integrations to not trigger or work with users' data without proper consent.</p>

<p class="css-1mglt86">Our Service allows Partners to integrate and create commands for various online third-party services ("Third-Party Services"). In order to take advantage of this feature, Partners may need to authenticate, register for or log into Third-Party Services through the Service or on the websites of their respective providers. When a Partner enables linking between or log in to Third-Party Services through the Service, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third-Party Service and Partner data and content contained within that Third-Party Service ("Login Credentials"). We store Partner Login Credentials long enough to enable linking to the Third-Party Service.</p>
<p class="css-1mglt86">When a Partner enables the Service to link content and data between Third-Party Services, the Third-Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that Partner may have provided to the Third-Party Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the rules Partner sets to govern the linking. In addition, Partner can use the Service to share content and third party Personal Data amongst the Third-Party Services they integrate with the Service. Please remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such Third-Party Services, and Rollout shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third-Party Services that may be enabled within the Service.</p>
<p class="css-1mglt86">We may retain certain personally non-identifiable information related to the data or content linked between Third-Party Services (for example, date sent, link configuration, names of the Third-Party Services), for the purpose of improving our Services and as described below in the "Aggregated Personal Data" section.
