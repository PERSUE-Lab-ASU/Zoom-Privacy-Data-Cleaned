Users of the Services should first direct their privacy inquiries to the administrator of the Workleap Platform within their organization, as their use of the Services is subject to their organization\u2019s own privacy policies. </p></div><div id=\"2-definition-of-personal-information\"><h2>2.

This may include, for example, email addresses and contact details and any similar information provided to Workleap in the course of its business operations, or which Workleap may receive from business inquiries.

Workleap may also, without limitations, collect and use the following types of information when Users visit and/or interact with Workleap on the Website: &nbsp; </p><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>Google Analytics.</strong> Workleap uses Google Analytics which allows it to see information on User website activities including, but not limited to, page views, source and time spent on the Website.

(collectively, \u201cWorkleap\u201d) offer employee experience software, including Workleap Officevibe, Workleap Onboarding, Workleap Skills and Workleap LMS (collectively the \u201cWorkleap Products\u201d), and a platform commercialised as \u201cWorkleap Platform\u201d which streamlines talent management and the adoption of productivity tools (the \u201cWorkleap Platform\u201d). Workleap understands the importance of protecting Personal Information (as defined below). For this reason, Workleap strives to have business procedures and security safeguards in place to protect Personal Information under its control.1. Scope of this policyThis privacy policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) describes Workleap\u2019s practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. This Policy is intended to establish responsible and transparent practices for the management of Personal Information, and to satisfy applicable legal requirements. This Policy sets out the standards, responsibilities and obligations of Workleap in respect of any Personal Information collected, accessed or processed by Workleap in the course of its business operations, and specifies Workleap\u2019s obligations arising from the Workleap Products\u2019 respective terms of service (available at https://workleap.com/trust-center/) (collectively the \u201cTerms\u201d) entered into between Workleap and its corporate customers (each, a \u201cCustomer\u201d), whereby Workleap might process or have access to Personal Information. \u00a0This Policy also governs Personal Information collected about Workleap\u2019s website users or users of the Workleap Products and Workleap Platform (the \u201cUsers\u201d) and explains how Workleap processes Personal Information collected from people who visit its website and otherwise interact with Workleap through https://www.workleap.com/ and its sister websites provided by Workleap (collectively, the \u201cWebsite\u201d) or through the Workleap Products and Workleap Platform. It also explains how Workleap uses cookies and similar technologies. \u202fUsers who do not agree with this Policy shall not access or use the Workleap Products or Workleap Platform, and any related services (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d) or the Website. To the extent Workleap provides the Services to an organization (e.g. to a User\u2019s employer), Workleap, as a data processor, processes such User\u2019s Personal Information under such organization\u2019s instructions as a data controller. Users of the Services should first direct their privacy inquiries to the administrator of the Workleap Platform within their organization, as their use of the Services is subject to their organization\u2019s own privacy policies. 2. Definition of Personal Information\u201cPersonal Information\u201d is defined as any information about an identifiable individual. This may include, for example, email addresses and contact details and any similar information provided to Workleap in the course of its business operations, or which Workleap may receive from business inquiries. Personal Information that cannot be associated with an identifiable individual, for instance through aggregation or anonymization, is no longer considered Personal Information.\u200d3. International ComplianceWorkleap complies with: (i) data protection laws applicable to Workleap; (ii) anti-spam legislation applicable to Workleap; and (iii) applicable industry standards concerning data protection, confidentiality or information security. Workleap has global operations and therefore, in some cases, information managed by Workleap may be transferred to, processed and stored in other countries, although at all times Workleap will ensure that Personal Information is protected by confidentiality and security procedures and protections that are, at a minimum, equivalent to those employed by Workleap itself. Workleap complies with this Policy as well as with applicable Canadian private sector data protection laws such as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d) and substantially similar provincial laws pertaining to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. PIPEDA provides for an adequate protection of Personal Information according to the European Commission Decision of 20 December 2001 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and the Council. Workleap also complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of Section 3 of the United Kingdom\u2019s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. Where applicable, Workleap\u2019s commitment to such regulation may be found in the Workleap Products\u2019 respective Data Processing Addendums (available at https://workleap.com/trust-center/). Workleap (or third parties acting on Workleap\u2019s behalf) may transfer Personal Information that Workleap collects to countries outside of the European Economic Area. Where such transfer occurs, Workleap will take steps to ensure that Personal Information is protected. Workleap will make such transfers only if at least one of the following conditions is present: a. Workleap has entered into a contract based on the \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d (including the United Kingdom\u2019s International Data Transfer Addendum), provided that such contract, combined with technical and organizational measures, offers appropriate safeguards for the rights of the individuals whose personal data is being transferred; b. Such transfer is governed by \u201cBinding Corporate Rules\u201d, which have been approved by data protection authorities; or c. Such transfer is covered by a European Union Commission \u201cadequacy decision\u201d. You can find out more about this here. 4. Collection of Personal Information through the Services Workleap collects information about its Users either directly from them, through their use of the Services or of the Website, or when they are provided by another source, as detailed below. a.

Content provided in a support context: By using the Services, Users may interact with Workleap\u2019s Customer Success team if they encounter a problem with the Services, or simply if they wish to learn more about Workleap products. In doing so, Users may submit contact information and other Personal Information to Workleap\u2019s Customer Success in order for them to identify and better assist the Users. Payment information: Workleap asks Customers to designate a representative for billing purposes. Workleap thus collects that person\u2019s name and contact information, together with the relevant payment details, which are collected through a trusted payment processing service. b.

Use of the Services: Workleap collects information about its Users when they use the Services. Depending on the Services used, this information may include the features used, the links clicked on, information about other Users interacted with, and other similar information.

Personal Information may be collected directly from third parties via data integrations in accordance with a Customer\u2019s instructions. Information provided by other Users: When Users submit content through the Services, they may submit Personal Information about other Users, such as their name, contact information, job title or similar information relating to their employment. Information provided by third-party services: Workleap collects information about Users when they connect a third-party service to their account, for instance to facilitate login or to integrate the Services within an external platform. Workleap may also collect information when Users authorize the Services to synchronize with their calendar or with a contact list. Information provided by Workleap\u2019s affiliated companies: Workleap collects information from its affiliated companies in accordance with their own privacy policy. Information collected by partners and service providers: Workleap may collect information about Users from its business and research partners who provide Workleap with information on Users\u2019 interests and engagement with Workleap Services.

Collection and Use of Personal Information through the WebsiteWorkleap generally collects and uses Personal Information from or about its Website Users as follows: a. Information Provided by UsersIn many cases, Workleap collects Personal Information directly from Users when they visit or use the Website. For instance, Workleap may collect the following types of information: \u00a0Inquiries and Requests for a Trial or Service. Workleap may collect a User\u2019s name, contact information, email address and any other information provided when they make an inquiry or contact Workleap through the Website, when they sign up to receive Workleap\u2019s newsletter or when they submit a request or an order for a Workleap trial or service. \u00a0Personalization of Website. When Users visit the Website, they may, from time to time, be invited to provide information, such as their job title, to help Workleap personalize or customize the User\u2019s experience when using the Website.b. Technical Information.When Users visit the Website, Workleap may collect technical information using electronic means such as cookies. This information may include information about visits to the Website, including the IP address of the User\u2019s computer and which browser was used to view the Website, the User\u2019s operating system, screen resolution, approximate location, browser language settings, the site the User came from, keywords searched (if arriving from a search engine), the number of page views, information entered, advertisements seen, etc. This data is used to measure and improve the effectiveness of the Website or to enhance the experience for Users. While most of the time this information is depersonalized, if this information relates to an identifiable individual, Workleap will treat this information as Personal Information. Workleap may also, without limitations, collect and use the following types of information when Users visit and/or interact with Workleap on the Website: \u00a0 Google Analytics. Workleap uses Google Analytics which allows it to see information on User website activities including, but not limited to, page views, source and time spent on the Website. This information is depersonalizedand is displayed as numbers, meaning that it cannot be tracked back to individuals. Users may opt-out of Workleap\u2019s use of Google Analytics by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. \u00a0HubSpot. Workleap uses HubSpot which allows it to see information on User website activities including, but not limited to, page views, source and time spent on our website. However, this information is not depersonalized and Users may not opt-out of Workleap\u2019s use of HubSpot. \u00a0Google AdWords: Workleap uses Google AdWords Remarketing to advertise Workleap across the Internet and to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors of the Website. AdWords remarketing will display ads to Users based on what parts of the Workleap website they have viewed by placing a cookie on the User\u2019s web browser. It could mean that Workleap advertises to previous visitors who haven\u2019t completed a task on the site, or this could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. This cookie does not in any way identify the User or give access to the User\u2019s computer or mobile device. The cookie is only used to indicate to other websites that the User has visited a particular page on the Website, so that they may show the User ads relating to that page. If Users do not wish to participate in Google AdWords Remarketing, they can opt out by visiting https://adssettings.google.com/. Interest-based Advertising. Workleap may also allow a limited number of trusted third parties to install cookies on User\u2019s hard drive from the Website. The Website may include third-party advertising and links to other websites which may be used to generate personalized advertisements. Personalized ads, sometimes referred to as interest-based or behavioral ads, are ads based upon information about Users, such as page views on the website, information requests or purchases on the website. Workleap does not provide any Personal Information to advertisers or to third party sites that display interest-based ads on the Website. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that Users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content displayed on the website are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards. Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on the Website directly to a User\u2019s browser. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. Workleap does not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third-party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

Choice with Cookies Users can block the use of cookies via the Website\u2019s cookie banner, or via their browser\u2019s settings. The \u201cHelp\u201d feature on most browsers will tell Users how to prevent their browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify the Users when they receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If Users choose to withhold consent, or subsequently block cookies, they may not be able to access all or part of the content of the website. Additionally, Users can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, by changing the add-on\u2019s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. \u00a0d.

Legal bases for processing Personal InformationPursuant to privacy laws applicable in the European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, Workleap collects and processes Personal Information about individuals under a variety of legal bases, depending on the reason for such collection or processing. Workleap shall only collect, process or use Personal Information where: Personal Information is required to provide the Workleap Products, the Workleap Platform and all services ancillary to the proper functioning of the Workleap Products and Workleap Platform, such as support services, to provide a personalized experience, and to ensure the security of the Workleap Products and Workleap Platform; The Customer or User gave Workleap consent to use Personal Information for a specific purpose (including for a purpose listed under section 6 hereof); Processing of Personal Information is necessary to comply with a legal obligation; Processing of Personal Information is warranted by a legitimate interest of Workleap (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as the purposes listed in paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of section 6 hereof, or to protect Workleap\u2019s legal rights and interests.If a User has consented to Workleap\u2019s use of their Personal Information, the User can withdraw their consent at any time, although this will not affect processing which took place prior to withdrawal. Where Workleap processes a User\u2019s Personal Information because it relies on Workleap\u2019s legitimate interests, objecting to the processing may mean the User will no longer be able to use or access the Services or the Website. 8. Disclosure of Personal InformationWorkleap will not sell, rent or trade Personal Information to any third party. Workleap does not share Personal Information with third-party tools, including AI models, except with permission from Customers or Users. However, Workleap may disclose Personal Information when authorized and/or required by law or as follows: 8.1. In the context of the Services. The content shared by Users on the Services and account or profile information linked to Users\u2019 accounts may be accessed by other Users from within their organization, and sometimes from outside their organization provided they were granted permission by their organization to access this information.

Workleap may share Personal Information within Workleap (i.e. between affiliates and subsidiaries) in Canada and the United States for the purposes described in Section 6 of this Policy. \u00a08.3 Service Providers. Workleap may grant access to Personal Information to third-party service providers who process it on behalf of Workleap to help provide and improve the Website and Services.

In the event Workleap receives a governmental or other regulatory request for any Personal Information, Workleap will promptly notify Customer and/or Users, unless it is prohibited to do so, in order that Customer and/or Users shall have the option to defend such action. Workleap shall reasonably cooperate with Customer and/or Users in such defense. 8.5 Business Transaction. Workleap may disclose Personal Information to a third party in connection with a sale or transfer of business or assets, an amalgamation, re-organization or financing of parts of its business.

Security of Personal InformationWorkleap will store and process the Personal Information in a manner consistent with industry security standards.

Data RetentionWorkleap will retain the Personal Information as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, unless a longer retention is required by law or justified by a legitimate business interest of Workleap, subject to applicable laws. Personal Information related to a User\u2019s Workleap Product and/or Workleap Platform account is retained so long as the account is active, in accordance with Customer\u2019s instructions. Some Personal Information about a User\u2019s account may be retained after the account is deactivated in order for other Users to make full use of the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon termination of the Terms, Workleap shall retain the Personal Information stored in the Workleap Products and/or Workleap Platform until Customer instructs Workleap to delete the Personal Information or until Customer\u2019s access to the Services is terminated in accordance with the Terms, whichever occurs first. \u00a0Upon expiry of the retention period, Personal Information is either deleted or permanently de-identified. Notwithstanding the applicable retention period, where Personal Information is kept in a backup, it will be stored in accordance with this Policy until it can be deleted, and it will not be used for any purpose other than as a backup copy. 11. Training and SupervisionWorkleap maintains adequate training programs to ensure that its employees and any third parties acting on its behalf are aware of and adhere to its Security Program. Workleap shall exercise necessary and appropriate supervision over its relevant employees to maintain the appropriate confidentiality and security of the Personal Information it manages. 12.

While the initial notice may be in a summary form, a comprehensive written notice shall be given to Customer within the legally required timeframe, where applicable. The notice shall summarize in reasonable detail the nature and scope of the Data Incident (including each data element type) and the corrective action taken or to be taken by Workleap. Workleap shall promptly take all necessary and advisable corrective actions, and shall cooperate with Customer in all reasonable efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of Data Incidents and to prevent their recurrence. 13. Users Legal Rights Regarding Personal InformationTo the extent that Workleap\u2019s processing of Personal Information is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) or to the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of Section 3 of the United Kingdom\u2019s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, Workleap relies on the legal bases described under section 7 hereof to process Personal Information. Subject to applicable laws, all Users have the right to: (i) access and rectification or erasure of Personal Information, including erasure and deletion of their profile on the Workleap Products and Workleap Platform, except to the extent that Workleap may need to retain certain Personal Information, including for record keeping purposes or to comply with legal obligations; (ii) restrict or object to Workleap\u2019s use of Personal Information (though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services or the Website) where Workleap is relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about User\u2019s particular situation which impacts on User\u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms; (iii) lodge a complaint with their local data protection authority (contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available\u202fhere); and (iv) data portability. Users will not have to pay a fee to exercise such rights, however, Workleap may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to comply if the request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. 15.
