                        <h2>18. Minors</h2>
                        <p><strong>18.1</strong> Our services are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 16 (<strong>Minor</strong>).</p>
                        <p><strong>18.2 </strong>Where you are a Minor, a Clinic must obtain the consent of the parent or guardian having legal capacity over you.</p>
                        <p><strong>18.3</strong> Nookal complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires the consent of a parent or guardian for the collection of personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
                        <p><strong>18.4</strong> Nookal does not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, without verifiable parental consent that would be obtained at and by the Clinic at which the minor receives treatment. However, it is possible that we may inadvertently receive information pertaining to children under 13 without such parental consent.</p>
                        <p><strong>18.5</strong> If you believe that we have received information about your child that is under the age of 13 without the consent of the minor’s parent or guardian, please do not hesitate to notify us at privacy@nookal.com. When we receive your notification, we will obtain your consent to retain the information or will delete it permanently.</p>
