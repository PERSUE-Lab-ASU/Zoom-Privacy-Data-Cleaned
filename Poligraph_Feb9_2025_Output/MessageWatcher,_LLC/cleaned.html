<p><strong>MessageWatcher May Use Certain Tracking Technologies to Collect Personal Information:</strong><br>
If necessary for support and service of our solutions, MessageWatcher may use tracking technologies like cookies, clear gifs, Web beacons, Web bugs, or other similar technologies. MessageWatcher may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by Third-party Sources that provide MessageWatcher services on an individual as well as aggregated basis. Cookies are used to identify which Website or marketing campaign you came from, which areas of the Site you visited and your actions on the Site, and where you go when you leave the Site. Cookies may be “session” cookies and deleted after you leave the Site or “persistent” cookies that are stored. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages, emails or advertisements and track clicks. MessageWatcher use clear gifs to determine whether Our marketing campaigns are successful, such as to determine whether you open an email MessageWatcher sends or whether you click on the links within the emails MessageWatcher sends. Generally, MessageWatcher use these technologies to:<br>
• manage content, analyze trends, monitor page visits and content downloads;<br>
• administer the site, track users’ movements around the site; and<br>
• gather demographic information about Our user base.</p>
<p>MessageWatcher may partner with third parties to manage Our advertising on third-party sites.

MessageWatcher respects your Do Not Track choices instituted at the browser level.</p>
