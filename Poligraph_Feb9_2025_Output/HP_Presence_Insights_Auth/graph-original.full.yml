    - To forecast ahead the time duration left prior to the disk space reaching a
      predetermined threshold
    - To provide information about devices that have high storage and memory utilization,
      and the software applications causing high CPU and memory utilization
    - To provide information on battery replacement recommendation based on battery
      health of devices enrolled in Proactive Management
    - To provide information on the mobility aspects of devices by classifying devices
      into various mobility factor categories and grouping device mobility factor
      by hardware health.
    - To provide the hardware inventory of devices by last seen status in Proactive
      Management
    - To show a monthly trend of suboptimal devices as unhealthy and facilitates drilling
      down to identify devices failing to meet individual performance metrics (i.e.
      battery health, disk health, thermal health, network, applications, memory,
      and storage space utilization).
