	<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The Gryphon Networks Corp. (“Gryphon”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) Privacy Policy is intended to inform you, as an organizational user of Gryphon’s services, of our practices regarding our collection, use, storing, and sharing of information.&nbsp;When we refer to Gryphon’s services, we mean all Gryphon products and services (“Services”). The majority of Gryphon’s Services are intended for use by organizations, and references to “you” and “your” throughout this Privacy Policy means the client organizations Gryphon has contracted with to provide such Services. We collect information under the direction of our subscriber client organizations and have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information we may process in connection with the subscriber organization’s use of our Services.</p>
<p>The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Services for which the subscriber organization(s) have engaged Gryphon. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization&nbsp;(e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the user accounts over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization’s policies.</p>
<p>Subscriber organization(s) are solely responsible for establishing policies for, and ensuring compliance with, all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any privacy policies, agreements, or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal information in connection with the use of our Services by individuals with whom our subscriber organization clients interact. We are not responsible&nbsp;for the privacy or security practices of an administrator’s organization, which may be different than this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Administrators&nbsp;are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>require you to reset your account password;</li>
<li>restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;</li>
<li>access information in and about your account;</li>
<li>access or retain information stored as part of your account;</li>

<li>change the email address associated with your account;</li>
<li>change your information, including profile information;</li>
<li>restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you use an email address or other username provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer)&nbsp;or the owner of the username provided, may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date.</p>
<p>Where we provide the Services under contract with an organization (for example, your employer) that organization controls the information processed by the Services. Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.</p>
<p>Your privacy is important to us, and so is being transparent about how we collect, use, and share information about you.</p>
<p>This policy is intended to help you understand:</p>

	<h4>III. How We Share Information We Collect</h4>
<p>Gryphon is not in the business of selling&nbsp;information about you to advertisers or other third parties. We provide sales acceleration and telemarketing compliance related Services, and this may require sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties.&nbsp; We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below,&nbsp;including in connection with possible business transfers.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other Service users</strong>:&nbsp;When you use the Services, we share certain information with other third parties, including vendors and partners.</p>
<p><strong>Authorized user accounts&nbsp;and administrators</strong>:&nbsp;If you subscribe or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization or associate that email address with your existing account, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain.&nbsp; If you are an administrator for a particular organization, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with third parties</strong>:&nbsp;We share information with third parties that help us&nbsp;operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We&nbsp;work with third-party service providers&nbsp;to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to&nbsp;access or use information about you.&nbsp; If a third-party service provider needs to&nbsp;access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, which includes complying with appropriate data security and confidentiality&nbsp;procedures designed to protect your information.</p>
<p><strong>Gryphon’s Partners</strong>:&nbsp;We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, support, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services. We may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Applications (“apps”)</strong>:&nbsp;You, your administrator or personnel may choose to&nbsp;add new functionality, configure the Services, or install third party apps within the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so may give the companies controlling such third-party apps access to your account and information about you such as&nbsp;your name and email address,&nbsp;and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.&nbsp;Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this Privacy Policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices.&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong>:&nbsp;The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third-party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Services</strong>:&nbsp;We may offer you the ability to interact with or share information with third parties through the Services. For example, we may offer users the ability to log in to the Services via a third-party service. When you intentionally interact with these third parties, we may share certain information with those third parties or receive information with those third parties, consistent with your privacy settings on the third-party service. Such information may include contact information, identification, and demographic information, and device information and identifiers. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third parties may use your information.</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong>:&nbsp;We share information about you with third parties when you provide us consent to do so.&nbsp; For example, we may display customer testimonials and the name of the individual providing the testimonial on behalf of the customer on our website.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with Applicable Laws</strong>:<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>Under certain circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, subpoena, regulation, legal process or governmental request,&nbsp;including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our&nbsp;Services, or (d) protect Gryphon, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with affiliated companies</strong>:&nbsp;We share information we collect with affiliated companies, including investors and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates and/or investors. The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.</p>

	<h4>IV. How We Store and Secure Information We Collect</h4>
<p><strong>Information storage and security</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store, including, but not limited to, secure storage buckets, data encryption at rest and in transit, use of identity access management framework, password protection (s) and unique identifiers supporting data segregation.</p>
<p><strong>How long we maintain and store information</strong>: How long we maintain and store information we collect about you may either be managed specific to client instruction or, generally if such client instruction is not provided, will be managed based on the type of information collected, as described in further detail below.&nbsp;After such time has lapsed due to client instruction or as otherwise specified herein, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will either securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible and/or send to you via your preferred mode of transfer upon written request.</p>
<p><strong>Account information</strong>:&nbsp;We&nbsp;retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.&nbsp; We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information&nbsp;to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p>
<p><strong>Information you share while accessing and using Services</strong>:&nbsp;If your user account is deactivated or disabled, some of the information and the content provided will remain active to allow other team members or other active users within the organization to make full use of the Services.</p>

	<h4>V. How You Can Access and Control Your Information</h4>
<p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Requests</strong>:&nbsp; Authorized administrators or designated personnel from client organizations have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured and mutually approved electronic format.&nbsp;We will use commercially reasonable efforts to address all such requests in writing and within a commercially reasonable time.</p>
<p><strong>Access and update your information</strong>:&nbsp;Gryphon’s Services and related documentation&nbsp;give you the ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;access and update certain information about you from within the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Deactivate your&nbsp;account:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account (subject to all contract terms and conditions).</p>
<p><strong>Delete your information</strong>:&nbsp;Gryphon’s Services and related documentation&nbsp;give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Request that we stop using your information</strong>:&nbsp;In some cases, authorized client administrators or other designated client organization personnel, may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using, and otherwise processing information where you believe we don’t have the appropriate rights to do so.&nbsp; For example, if you believe a Services account was created for your organization without permission, you can request that we delete such account as provided in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.&nbsp; If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-out of&nbsp;communications:</strong>&nbsp;You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe and/or opt-out link within each email, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.&nbsp; Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding Gryphon’s&nbsp;Services if you or your organization remains and active and authorized user of our Services. Gryphon complies with the various CAN-SPAM Act requirements relative to the collection, use and management of commercial email marketing activities.</p>
<p><strong>Turn off Cookie Controls</strong>:&nbsp;Relevant browser-based cookie controls are described in our&nbsp;Cookie Policy.</p>
<p><strong>International Transfer of Information:</strong>&nbsp;While not standard practice for Gryphon, if Gryphon does transfers personal information beyond the country of origin, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws. Whether your personal data is processed within your country of residence or beyond, we will take steps to ensure that your data is subject to appropriate safeguards required of us under the Privacy Policy, applicable data protection laws, and appropriate legally recognized data transfer adequacy mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Additional privacy references:</strong></p>
<p><strong>California Requirements</strong></p>
<p><em>Exercising your rights</em>: If you are a California resident, there are some additional rights that may be available to you under the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”).

For more information on how to exercise your rights please visit the “How to access and control your information” section of this policy. We encourage you to manage your information, and to make use of the privacy controls we have included in our Services.&nbsp;You will not be discriminated against for exercising any of your privacy rights under the CCPA.&nbsp;In order to protect your information from unauthorized access or deletion, we may require you to provide additional information for verification. If we cannot verify your identity, we will not provide or delete your information.</p>
<p><em>Sharing your personal information</em>: Gryphon does not sell your personal information. However, we may share certain personal information for a business purpose. If we share your personal data with partners, or with vendors acting on our behalf, we do so under binding agreements that require the third party to use and protect the personal data in accordance with the principles described in this Privacy Policy. These third parties are authorized to use your personal data only as necessary to provide services to us. Additionally, we may share aggregated, anonymous, or non-identifiable electronic data with our partners and with vendors acting on our behalf. See the “How we share information we collect” section of this policy.</p>
<p><em>Processing your information</em>: This policy describes the categories of personal information we may collect, the sources of that information, and our deletion and retention policies.&nbsp;We have also included information about how we may process your information, which includes for “business purposes” under the CCPA, such as to protect against illegal activities, and for the development of new products, features, and technologies.&nbsp; If you have questions about the categories of information we may collect about you, please be sure to visit the section of this policy called, “What information we collect about you.”&nbsp;For more details about our processing activities, please be sure to visit the section called, “How we use information we collect.”</p>

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s internet usage and help to enforce this Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through our website or Services without their permission.
