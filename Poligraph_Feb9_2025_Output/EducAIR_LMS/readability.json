We keep our Cookie Notice under regular review to best reflect the technology we use on our sites.</p>\n<p>COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES WE USE</p>\n<p>Where Insignia Learning Pvt Ltd or its group companies talk about cookies and tracking technology on our websites we refer to the following:</p>\n<p>FLASH COOKIES</p>\n<p>A local shared object, sometimes called a \u201cFlash cookie,\u201d is a data file that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit. They are most often used to enhance your web-browsing experience. Adobe\u2019s website provides details regarding<br><a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/privacy.html\">Flash Cookies</a></p>\n<p>WEB BEACONS</p>\n<p>To help us better manage content we employ web beacons in emails that we send to our subscribers. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients enabling us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>PIXELS</p>\n<p>A pixel refers to the code that is placed on your computer to trigger a cookie. We sometimes use this methodology to allow us to deliver more relevant messages to you e.g. to understand how you interact with our email marketing.</p>\n<p>LOG FILES</p>\n<p>We use log files to record events that occur on our websites. This may include, though not exclusively, the type, content, or time of transaction made via your device. These audit trails allow us to analyze activities on our websites.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n<h3>How and why we use Cookies And Tracking Technologies</h3>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>TYPES OF COOKIES AND HOW THEY ARE SET</p>\n<p>There are two types of cookies:</p>\n<p>\u201cSession Cookies\u201d \u2013 Stored temporarily in your computer\u2019s memory while you are visiting a website and are deleted when you close your browser.</p>\n<p>\u201cPersistent Cookies\u201d \u2013 Stored for a set period on your computer and used to determine whether there has been any contact between us and your computer in the past.</p>\n<p>There are two ways cookies set can be on our websites:</p>\n<p>\u201c1st Party Cookies\u2019 \u2013 cookies that are set by the website domain (or belonging to a subdomain) of the website.</p>\n<p>\u201c3rd Party Cookies\u201d \u2013 cookies that are set by another website domain.</p>\n<p>Cookies Classification</p>\n<p>We are categorizing cookies set on the site by ourselves and our main technology partners into the following categories:</p>\n<p>Category 1: Strictly necessary cookies<br>These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around a website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you\u2019ve asked for (such as access to secure areas) can\u2019t be provided.
