<p>Like many Internet companies, we may also receive information through cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other similar technologies that we use on some of our web-hosted products and services. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on an end-user's hard drive. Cookies enhance your experience by saving you the effort of providing specific information each time you revisit our hosted webpages and by customizing content based on your preferences. The information stored in cookies often does not reveal your identity directly; however, in some countries, including the European Economic Area, it is considered personal data.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.

<a id="disclosures-of-your-personal-data" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3><strong><span>5. Disclosures of your personal data</span></strong></h3>
<p>We do not sell, trade, distribute or rent personal data to third parties; however we may use third party contractors to supplement our workforce activities. We may share your personal data with the parties set out below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal Third Parties</strong>
<ul>
<li>Other companies in the Calero Group including the staff of those companies who are based in the USA, England, Scotland, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Japan, Latvia, Austria, France, Germany, and South Africa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>External Third Parties </strong>
<ul>
<li>Contractors, business partners and service providers acting as processors who provide: hosting services including The Bunker Ultra Secure Hosting, Pulsant Business Unlimited, AWS, OCI and Microsoft Azure based in the USA, the UK, Ireland, the EU and Canada; IT and administration support and helpdesk services and functions including: (i) Digital Mobile Innovations, LLC based in the USA, Canada, Spain, India, the UK, and Cambodia; (ii) The TOTAN Information Technology Co., Ltd based in Japan; (iii) IRIS Software, Inc. based in the USA, Canada and India; (iv) TelCon based in the USA; and (v) Regus Group Companies based worldwide.</li>
<li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based worldwide who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities based worldwide who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganisation, dissolution or liquidation). Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to enter into a data processing agreement with us which requires them to respect the security of your personal data, to safeguard it and treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<a id="international-transfers" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3><strong><span>6. International transfers</span></strong></h3>
<p>We share your personal data within the Calero Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>). We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. These rules are called "binding corporate rules". For further details, see European Commission: Binding corporate rules.</p>
<p>Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact us if you want further details on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="data-security" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3><strong><span>7. Data security</span></strong></h3>
<p>We have put in place appropriate administrative, organizational, technical, security measures and physical safeguards to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. Our hosted solutions maintain personal data on secure servers located in secure data centers with live personnel monitoring 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Personal data stored on these servers is protected by various measures, including encryption, firewalls restricting access and unique login IDs and passwords.</p>
<p>In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know with limited access to perform only such functions as they are authorized to perform. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are made aware of their responsibilities to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of that data and will have been provided training and instruction on how to do so. We require our partners to use appropriate security measures.</p>
<p>Data security is paramount, and we are constantly re-evaluating and deploying, where appropriate, the latest technologies, including Secure Socket Layer encryption and firewalls, to enhance our security and the confidentiality of personal data. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<a id="data-retention" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3><strong><span>8. Data retention</span></strong></h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: #003a70;"><strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong></span></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<a id="your-legal-rights" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h3><strong><span>9. Your legal rights</span></strong></h3>
<p>In certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection law in relation to your personal data including the right to:</p>
<p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; (iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent nor will it prevent us from retaining your personal data where we have a legal requirement to do so. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our DPO at the contact details set out below.</p>
<p><span style="color: #003a70; font-size: 18px;"><strong>No fee usually required </strong></span></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><span style="color: #003a70; font-size: 18px;"><strong>What we may need from you </strong></span></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><span style="color: #003a70; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Time limit to respond </strong></span></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 1 month. Occasionally it could take us longer than 1 month if your request is complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p><span style="color: #003a70; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Contact details </strong></span></p>
