However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us.

For example, users of&nbsp;Sales Navigator&nbsp;will be asked to share their \u201csocial selling index\u201d, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity.

The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not.

Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.2.5 Marketing\n    \n      We promote our Services to you and others.\n      \n      In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members\u2019 data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.2.6 Developing Services and Research\n    \n      We develop our Services and conduct research\n      \n      Service DevelopmentWe use data, including public feedback, to conduct\u00a0research\u00a0and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.Other ResearchWe seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful.

Subject to your\u00a0settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our\u00a0Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their\u00a0usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, MessagesOur Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your\u00a0settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).In a\u00a0group, posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your\u00a0settings.Any information you share through companies\u2019 or other organizations\u2019 pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that \u201cpage owner\u201d as a follower.We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your\u00a0settings\u00a0where applicable.Subject to your\u00a0settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you choices about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.When you like or re-share or comment on another\u2019s content (including ads), others will be able to view these \u201csocial actions\u201d and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).\n    \n      Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.\n      \n      Enterprise AccountsYour employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of\u00a0Sales Navigator\u00a0will be asked to share their \u201csocial selling index\u201d, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).Subject to your\u00a0settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.3.2 Communication Archival\n    \n      Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\n      \n      Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.3.3 Others\u2019 Services\n    \n      You may link your account with others\u2019 services so that they can look up your contacts\u2019 profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms.

When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may\u00a0revoke\u00a0the link with such accounts.The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) may be available to them on other services.

Where allowed, we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others.

If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).3.6 Legal Disclosures\n    \n      We may need to share your data when we believe it\u2019s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.\n      \n      It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others.
