            <h2>SECURITY AND SERVICE POLICY</h2>
            <h4>OUR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
            <p>We shall:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>provide reasonable support for your services to you at no additional charge. With the exception of near-immediate responses to service outages, all support will be provided within twenty-four to forty-eight hours of the request and via one of our support mediums.  Should a support request demand work on our part that we determine to be unreasonable, we will state the cost of providing such support before moving forward with the request.</li>
                <li>use commercially reasonable efforts to make your services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for planned or emergency downtime or any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation acts of God, acts of government, floods, fires, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems, internet service provider failures or delays, denial of service attacks, or system hardware or software failure.</li>
                <li>use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your data, as defined below in "Protection of Your Data."</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>LICENSE</h4>
            <p>We grant you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to access and use our services and to allow your users to access and use your services, subject to the terms of this Agreement. For custom development projects (and unless a signed and executed agreement between us and you states otherwise), we retain the copyright to all coding elements of all projects; however, we provide you with a license for you to use those elements in the deliverables of a given project. Additionally, we agree to extend that license in perpetuity as long as you continue hosting the project with us. At no time will we exercise ownership over or copyright to data you enter into our products or that is housed within our services.</p>
            <h4>PROTECTION OF YOUR DATA</h4>
            <p>All of our systems and internal networking equipment are constantly monitored by us and by an outside agency, and are subject to weekly security audits from an outside agency. We maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of your data. All of your data is housed in protected database systems and subject to constant and retained backups.</p>
            <p>We shall not modify your data, disclose your data except as compelled by law, as stated within this Agreement, or as expressly permitted in writing by you. We will not access your data except to provide your services and prevent or address service or technical problems, unless at your request in connection with customer support matters.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge and agree that electronic communications and databases, including those such as our services, are subject to errors, tampering and break-ins. While we do use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your data, and while we do utilize the services of outside agencies to audit our system security, we do not guarantee or warrant that errors, tampering, break-ins, or other such events will not take place with respect to our services. Should we become aware of any unauthorized access to or release of, or potential release of your data, we will notify you within twenty-four hours of that discovery. Additionally, within seventy-two hours of that discovery, we will update you on our reaction to that discovery. You agree that our liability to such a discovery is limited to the notifications stated here and by the "Liability, Disclaimer and Other Legal Policy" section of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>When cardholder data is used by one of our services or systems, we warranty that such data is handled in accordance with PCI requirements. You agree that all inquiries or legal concerns regarding the loss or exposure of such data shall be against our payment processor or the manufacturer of the software and programs that house your credit card data and that, unless we are the manufacturer of such software or programs, you shall hold us harmless for such. If your service allows you to enter form questions, you agree that no such question will be used to collect cardholder data and that doing so is a violation of this Agreement for which you will be solely responsible.</p>
            <h4 id="WCO1">USAGE LIMITATIONS</h4>
            <p>Services may be subject to other limitations, such as, for example, limits on the number of locations that can use a single service.</p>
            <p>A subscription to WCONLINE is licensed for use by an unlimited number of students, staff, administrators at one single academic center on a single campus. For the purposes of this license, a "campus" is defined as a single geographical location with a single company or institutional title and with a unique student body and a unified faculty and staff. Limited exceptions to this "usage limitation" can be made by petition of the subscriber and at the discretion of WCONLINE.  WCONLINE can also be used by institutions which conduct their business primarily online.  That use is governed by our <a href="https://mywconline.com/tos/supplement">Terms of Service Supplement for Online-Only Institutions</a>.</p>
            <h4>RETURN, TRANSFER OR DESTRUCTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>All services provide you with the opportunity to download a copy of your data, and you are solely responsible for doing so before canceling your services with us.  Within twenty-four hours of your request to cancel your service or services, we will remove access to your services and disconnect your data from our systems. While we are under no obligation to do so (and while we typically delete your data immediately and permanently when you cancel), we may retain your data for up to one year after you have cancelled (in the form of off-site backups).  In no more than one year, and once those backups expire, your data will be permanently destroyed.</p>
            <h2>PAYMENT AND CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>
            <p>You agree to supply appropriate payment for the services received from us and that, unless you terminate your service or services with us per the "Termination" policy below, those services will be billed on a recurring basis. As our client, it is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date, and that all invoices are paid on time. You are also responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to us and notifying us of any changes to such information.</p>
            <p>If you have not paid for your services within sixty days of being invoiced for those services, then at our discretion, we may suspend your services until such amounts are paid in full. We also reserve the right to employ the services of an outside collection firm to recover the outstanding balance. We will not exercise our rights to service suspension, or a collection firm if you are disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.</p>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including but not limited to value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction. You are responsible for paying all such taxes associated with your services. If we have the legal obligation to pay or collect such taxes for which you are responsible under this paragraph, such as for sales tax, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by you unless you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, we are solely responsible for taxes assessable against us based on our income, property, and employees.</p>
            <h4>TERM</h4>
            <p>The initial term of this Agreement and of your services will commence on the date that you place an order or a request for a trial with us and will continue until terminated either by us or by you as per the "Termination" policy below. If your services are not subscription services or are one-time services, such as some design services, then the term will end once the terms of the separate service contract have been fulfilled or once the requested service has been delivered by us to you. If your services are provided through SiteTenders.com, then this term section does not apply (as the term is governed by your signed agreement with us).
            </p><p>Shortly before the beginning of each term, we will invoice you for the next term. Payment is due within thirty days of the mailing, either via e-mail or U.S. Mail, of such an invoice.</p>
            <h4>FREE AND NO-RISK TRIALS</h4>
            <p>For some of our services, we offer a free or no-risk trial. This trial does not waive your requirement to pay for the service. For free trials, you are responsible for paying for the service after the trial period unless you terminate the service within the trial period. For no-risk trials, you are responsible for paying for the trial period and for the next service term after the conclusion of the trial period.  If you cancel an account within the trial period, and then sign up again less than six months later, that indicates a decision to use the service and will result in invoicing for the trial period.</p>
            <p>We never terminate your service automatically at the end of a trial. You understand that you are responsible for all service payments until you terminate your service per the "Termination" policy below.</p>
            <h4>TERMINATION</h4>
            <p>You have the right to terminate your service at any time. Terminations must be done in writing via e-mail or trackable carrier. Once we receive your termination request and have confirmed all necessary information with you, we will inform you in writing, usually via e-mail, that your account has been cancelled. Until you have received such notice or one day after provable receipt of such notice (such as via a trackable delivery number), you are responsible for all service payments. All payments made are non-refundable.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to terminate your services at any time with or without notice. If your services are terminated by us, you will receive a pro-rated refund of any paid subscription fees for a time period that has not yet passed. If you violate this Agreement, as solely determined by us, you waive your right to a refund.</p>
            <p>Some of our services, such as our print publications and design services, are not refundable regardless of the reason for service termination. If your services are provided through SiteTenders.com, then this termination section does not apply (as termination is governed by your signed agreement with us).</p>
            <h2 id="privacy">PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
            <p>We want you to be informed about how we protect the privacy of our clients (including the students, instructors, business owners, and others who use our programs and subscribe to our services).</p>
            <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information about individuals through our sites or programs without the individual's explicit knowledge, and all such information is collected directly from that specific individual. We use the information we collect from individuals only to allow them to access and use our programs or to service their subscriptions.</p>
            <p>We do not sell, share, or distribute in any way any information that we collect, nor do we use such information for any other purpose than explicitly stated here. All information contained in WCONLINE databases is stored on secure servers solely used and managed by WCONLINE.</p>
            <p>Our relationship is with you in the sense that you, as the entity paying us to provide a given service, are our client. If you are in an area with local, state, or national laws that concern privacy or data consent, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for those laws and agree to hold us harmless from any and all demands, liabilities, losses, costs and claims related to those laws.  Should you need to add a notice or question to our service in order to be compliant with such laws (or should you need to remove data from your service in response to such laws), you agree to do so or ask us for help in doing so.</p>
            <p>On some of our services, we use cookies to give you the best possible experience--such as to allow you to remain logged in instead of having to log in repeatedly. If you continue without changing your settings, we'll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies.</p>
            <p>Should you have any questions about this policy, please contact us via any of the methods on the contact page of our site.</p>
            <h4 id="google-meet">GOOGLE MEET INTEGRATION — LIMITED USE POLICY</h4>
            <p>WCONLINE's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
            <h2>LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POLICY</h2>
            <p>Both we and you acknowledge that this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Florida and controlling United States federal law, without regard to choice or conflicts of law rules. Additionally, both we and you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Osceola County, Florida for all matters governed by this Agreement. We and you hereby waive any right to jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>
            <p>You agree to submit to binding arbitration. If any disputes or claims arise against us, such disputes will be handled by an arbitrator of our choosing. An arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association will be selected. All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final and the arbitrator's award is final and binding on all parties. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration laws, governs all arbitration under this paragraph. You are also responsible for any and all costs related to such arbitration.</p>
            <h4>DISCLAIMER</h4>
            <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER YOU NOR WE MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TO THE MAXIUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
            <h4>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
            <p>Neither your nor our liability with respect to any single incident, as defined by us, arising out of or related to this Agreement (whether in contract or tort or under any other theory of liability) shall exceed the amount paid by you hereunder in the six (6) months preceding the incident, provided that in no event shall either party's aggregate liability arising out of or related to this Agreement (whether in contract or tort or under any other theory of liability) exceed the total amount paid by you hereunder.</p>
            <h4>INDEMNIFICATION</h4>
            <p>You agree that you shall defend, indemnify, save and hold us harmless from any and all demands, liabilities, losses, costs and claims, including reasonable attorney's fees asserted against us, our agents, our customers, officers and employees, that may arise or result from any service provided or performed or agreed to be performed or any product sold by you, your agent, employee, or assigns. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless against liabilities arising out of any injury to person or property caused by any products sold or otherwise distributed in connection with us, any material suppled by you infringing or allegedly infringing on the proprietary rights of a third party, any claims of copyright infringement, or any defective products or services sold to your customers through our services.</p>
            <h4>EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES</h4>
            <p>In no event shall you have any liability to us or we any liability to you for any lost profits or revenues or for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover or punitive damages however caused, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not the party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing disclaimer shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
            <h4>RESERVATION OF RIGHTS IN SERVICES</h4>
            <p>We reserve the rights, title and interest in and to our services and systems, including all related intellectual property rights. No rights are granted to you hereunder other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement. You shall not create or permit the creation of any derivative works based on our services, reverse engineer our services, or access the services in order to build a competitive product service or copy any features, functions or graphics of the services.</p>
            <p>Subject to the limited rights granted by you in this Agreement, we acquire no right, title or interest from you under this Agreement in or to your data, including any intellectual property rights therein.</p>
            <h4>SUGGESTIONS</h4>
            <p>We shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual license to use and incorporate into our services any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by you, including by your users, related to the operation of our services.</p>
            <h4>NOTICES</h4>
            <p>Any notice, notification, demand or request provided under this Agreement must be in writing and sent to you at your address that you list with us and sent to us at 1159 2nd Ave #116, New York, NY 10065. Any such notices must be sent via a trackable carrier that independently verifies delivery.</p>
            <h4>SEVERABILITY</h4>
            <p>If any provision of this Agreement will be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <h4>CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE</h4>
