A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.</p><p><u>How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?</u></p><p>We, and our advertising and analytics partners, use these technologies in our websites, apps, and online services to collect personal data (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) when you use our services, including personal data about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. This data is used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our websites and apps perform, track your interaction with the site or app, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. We and/or our partners also share the data we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.</p><p><u>What controls are available? </u></p><p>There are a range of cookie and related controls available through browsers and elsewhere. See the “<a href="#_CHOICE_AND_CONTROL">Choice and Control of Personal Data</a>” section below for details.</p><p><strong>OUR USE OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p><p>We use the personal data we collect for purposes described in this privacy notice or as otherwise disclosed to you. For example, we use personal data for the following purposes:</p><ul><li><strong>Product and service delivery</strong>. To provide and deliver our services, including troubleshooting, improving, and personalizing those services.</li><li><strong>Business operations</strong>.

In addition, we disclose each of the categories of personal data described above, to the types of third parties described below, for the following business purposes:</p><ul><li><strong>Service providers</strong>. We provide personal data to vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we’ve hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions.</li><li><strong>Financial services &amp; payment processing</strong>. When you provide payment data, for example to pay for services, we will disclose payment and transactional data to banks and other entities as necessary for payment processing, fraud prevention, credit risk reduction, analytics, or other related financial services.</li><li><strong>Corporate transactions</strong>. We may disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction or proceeding such as a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or a transfer, divestiture, or sale of all or a portion of our business or assets.</li><li><strong>Legal and law enforcement</strong>. We will access, disclose, and preserve personal data when we believe doing so is necessary to comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement, national security, or other government</li><li><strong>Security, safety, and protecting rights</strong>. We will disclose personal data if we believe it is necessary to:<ul><li>protect our customers and others, for example to prevent spam or attempts to commit fraud, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;</li><li>operate and maintain the security of our services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; or</li><li>protect the rights or property of ourselves or others, including enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Third party analytics companies may also collect personal data through our website and apps including identifiers and device information (such as cookie IDs, device IDs, and IP address), geolocation data, usage data, and inferences based on and associated with that data, as described in the “<a href="#_COOKIES,_WEB_BEACONS,">Cookies</a>” section of this statement.</p><p>Please note that some of our services may also include integrations, references, or links to services provided by third parties whose privacy practices differ from ours. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties, or allow us to share personal data with them, that data is governed by their privacy notices.</p><p>Finally, we may disclose de-identified information in accordance with applicable law.</p><h5><strong>CHOICE AND CONTROL OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></h5><p>We provide a variety of ways for you to control the personal data we hold about you, including choices about how we use that data. In some jurisdictions, these controls and choices may be enforceable as rights under applicable law.</p><p><u>Cookies</u>. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies may be deleted and may need to be recreated.&nbsp;</p><p>These choices are specific to the device or browser you are using. If you access our services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.</p><p><u>Communications preferences</u>. You can choose whether to receive promotional email or phone communications from us. If you receive promotional email from us and would like to unsubscribe, you can do so by following the directions in that message or by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below. If you receive a sales call from us, you can ask to be placed on our do-not-call list. These choices do not apply to certain informational communications including surveys and mandatory service communications.</p><p><u>European/UK Data Protection Rights</u>.</p><p>If the processing of personal data about you is subject to European Union or United Kingdom data protection law, you have certain rights with respect to that data:</p><ul><li>You can request access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data;</li><li>If any automated processing of personal data is based on your consent or a contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of the personal data in a usable and portable format;</li><li>If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you can withdraw consent for future processing at any time; and</li><li>You can object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of personal data under certain circumstances;</li></ul><p>To make such requests, please use the contact information at the bottom of this notice. Note that if you have an account with us, you may update and correct certain profile information. You may also delete your account from your account settings page.</p><p>We rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing personal data about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfil other legitimate interests.</p><p>Except for the automated controls described above, if you send us a request to exercise your rights or these choices, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline requests in certain cases. For example, we may decline requests where granting the request would be prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or other rights of another person, would reveal a trade secret or other confidential information, or would interfere with a legal or business obligation that requires retention or use of the data. Further, we may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law.</p><p>When we are processing data on behalf of another party that is the “data controller,” you should direct your request to that party. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.</p><p><strong>RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p><p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.</p><p><strong>TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p><p>The personal data we collect may be stored and processed in your country or region, or in any other country where we or our service providers process data, some of which may have laws that offer different levels of data protection than the country in which you reside. We take steps to process and protect personal data as described in this statement wherever the data is located. We will also implement appropriate transfer mechanisms where required by law.</p><p><strong>SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p><p>We take reasonable and appropriate steps to help protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p><p>To help us protect personal data, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.</p><p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE</strong></p><p>We will update this privacy notice when necessary to reflect changes in our services, how we use personal data, or the applicable law. When we post changes to the statement, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of the statement.&nbsp; If we make material changes to the statement, we will provide notice or obtain consent regarding such changes as may be required by law.</p><p><strong>HOW TO CONTACT US</strong></p><p>If you have a privacy concern, complaint, or a question for DataDasher, please contact us:</p><p>DataDasher Inc.<br><a href="mailto:support@datadasher.ai">support@datadasher.ai</a> &nbsp;<br>530 Lytton Avenue 2nd Floor <br>Palo Alto, CA 94301 &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>United States</p>						</div>
