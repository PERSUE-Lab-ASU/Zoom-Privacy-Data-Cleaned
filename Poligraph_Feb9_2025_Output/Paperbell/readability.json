In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</span></p>\n<p><span>All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology and using trusted third parties. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</span></p>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</span></p>\n<h2><span>How long we store your personal data for</span></h2>\n<p><span>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span>We normally delete personal identifiable information we hold on you within 12 months of you unsubscribing, but in some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data sooner: see Deleting personal data below for further information.</span></p>\n<p><span>Where we anonymise your personal data (i.e. so that it can no longer be associated with you) for further research or statistical purposes, then we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Your rights</span></h2>\n<p><span>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Access to your information</span></li>\n<li><span>Request correction of your personal data</span></li>\n<li><span>Request deletion of your personal data</span></li>\n<li><span>Object to processing of your personal data</span></li>\n<li><span>Request restriction of processing your personal data</span></li>\n<li><span>Request transfer of your personal data</span></li>\n<li><span>Right to withdraw consent</span></li>\n<li><span>Right to review by an independent authority</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</span></p>\n<p><span>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Access to your information</span></h2>\n<p><span>You have the right to ask for a copy of the information which we hold on you (commonly known as a \u2018data subject access request\u2019).</span></p>\n<p><span>This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Correcting personal data</span></h2>\n<p><span>You have the right to request that we correct personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Deleting personal data</span></h2>\n<p><span>You may ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. This is more commonly known as the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.</span></p>\n<p><span>Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request to delete or remove personal data for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Objecting to processing</span></h2>\n<p><span>You have the right to stop us processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. We will always inform you if we intend to use your personal data for such purposes, or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at hello@paperbell.com.</span></p>\n<p><span>You may also object to us processing your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Restriction of processing</span></h2>\n<p><span>This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>if you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy;</span></li>\n<li><span>where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</span></li>\n<li><span>where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</span></li>\n<li><span>you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Transferring your personal data</span></h2>\n<p><span>In certain circumstances, you may request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</span></p>\n<p><span>Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Withdrawing consent</span></h2>\n<p><span>Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data you can withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Review by an independent authority</span></h2>\n<p><span>You will always have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory body. The relevant authority in the UK is the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. If you do have a complaint, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please do contact us in the first instance if possible.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Changes to our privacy policy</span></h2>\n<p><span>This version was last updated on 18th June 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current.

Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.

You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at hello@paperbell.com.\nYou may also object to us processing your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\nRestriction of processing\nThis enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:\n\nif you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy;\nwhere our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;\nwhere you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or\nyou have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\nTransferring your personal data\nIn certain circumstances, you may request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nPlease note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\nWithdrawing consent\nWhere we are relying on consent to process your personal data you can withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nReview by an independent authority\nYou will always have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory body.

If you do have a complaint, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please do contact us in the first instance if possible.\nChanges to our privacy policy\nThis version was last updated on 18th June 2020.\nIt is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current.
