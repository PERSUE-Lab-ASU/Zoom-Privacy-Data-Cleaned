    <ol start="2">
        <li><b><u>Cookies and Other Automatic Tracking Technologies</u></b></li>
    </ol>
    <p><u>Description of the Technologies Utilized on the Website</u>: We may use various technologies to collect and store information when you access or use the Website, including sending cookies, embedded scripts, web beacons, pixel tags or other anonymous
        identifiers to your device, or otherwise tracking your activities on the Website over time. We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services
        (a practice known as "behavioral tracking"). The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity. Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally
        identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you). For example, we may tie this information to personal information about you that we collect from other sources or that you provide to us. If this happens, we will treat the combined
        information as personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p><u>Cookies</u>: The Website uses cookies, which are small text files that, within the scope of your visit to the Website, are transmitted to your browser and are stored by your browser on your computer for later retrieval. You yourself can determine,
        through settings in your browser, the extent to which cookies can be placed and retrieved. If you deactivate your setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of the Website may be entirely usable. Cookies are used to make
        the Website more user-friendly (known as "Necessary Cookies"). Without the use of these cookies, the number of unique users on the Website cannot be determined. Cookies also provide you with certain functions on the Website. In addition,
        cookies are also used for the website presence, which, for example, allows surfing behavior to be analyzed.</p>
    <p><u>Third-party content, features or application providers may collect information</u>: Some content (including advertisements), applications, or features on the Website may be served by third parties, including our third-party service providers, content
        providers, advertisers, ad networks and servers, and other application providers. These third parties may collect information about you when you use the Website using cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies.
        Please note that the information collected by these third parties may be associated with your personal information and that these third parties may collect information, including your personal information, about your online activities over time
        and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content. We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they
        may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>We may use third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of the Website. For example, we may use Google Analytics as one of our analytics service providers that tracks and reports website traffic. For more information on the
                privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy &amp; Terms <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">web page</a>. To learn more about how Google collects and uses data <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">here</a>.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>We may use third-party service providers, such as Google, to display advertising content on the Website. When you visit the Website, a request is sent to Google and Google processes the domain name and the IP address of the Website visitor
                to dynamically return the advertising content of the Website. Google sets a cookie. The display of the advertising content is the primary purpose of the Website, and the setting of the cookie is technically necessary to provide the advertising
                content of the Website. The advertising content is not personalized, and no profile of the Website visitor is generated. You can prevent the setting of cookies by Google by setting your browser accordingly, in particular by suppressing
                cookies from third-party providers, and thus prevent cookies from being set. See here for further information: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>Choices as to Cookies and Other Automatic Tracking Technologies</u>: It may be possible to disable some (but not all) cookies or automatic data collection technologies through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality
        of all or a portion of the Website. The method for disabling cookies or other automatic collection technologies may vary by device and browser but can usually be found in preferences or security settings. For example, iOS and Android devices each
        have settings which are designed to limit forms of ad tracking.</p>
    <p><u>Conversion Tracking Pixel</u>: Pixels from the following providers may be used for conversion measurement:</p>
    <ul class="ul-compact">

            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By setting the conversion tracking pixel, the behavior of users can be tracked after they have been redirected to the target page by clicking on an advertisement. This procedure is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Provider advertisements
        for statistical and market research purposes and can help to optimize future advertising measures.
    </p>
    <p>The data collected does not allow us to draw any conclusions about the identity of users. However, the data is stored and processed by the respective Provider so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and the respective Provider
        can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with its own data protection guidelines. This allows the Provider to enable advertisements to be placed on their website and outside their website. This use of the data cannot be
        influenced by us as a website operator.</p>
    <p>You will find further information on the protection of your privacy as well as the possibility of revoking your consent in the privacy policies of the respective Providers:</p>

    <p><u>Exercising Your Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</u>:</p>
    <p class="p-indented"><i>How to Exercise</i>. To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 100px;">Web: <a href="https://www.bodis.com/contact">https://www.bodis.com/contact</a></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 100px;">Mailing Address: Bodis, LLC 4830 W Kennedy Blvd, Suite 600, Tampa, FL 33609</p>
    <p class="p-indented">Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
    <p class="p-indented"><i>General Requirements</i>. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you
        are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. It must also describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
    </p>
    <p class="p-indented">We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require
        you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
    <p class="p-indented"><i>Response Timing and Format</i>. We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at: <a href="https://www.bodis.com/contact">https://www.bodis.com/contact</a>. We endeavor to respond to
        a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we may deliver our written
        response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
    <p class="p-indented">Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests,
        we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
    <p class="p-indented">We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you
        with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
    <p><u>Non-Discrimination</u>:</p>
    <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
    </p>
    <ul class="ul-compact">
        <li>
            <p>Deny you goods or services.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value
        and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
    <p><u>Other California Privacy Rights</u>:</p>
    <p>California's "Shine the Light" law permits users of the Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such
        a request, please send a message to <a href="https://www.bodis.com/contact">https://www.bodis.com/contact</a> or write us at:</p>
