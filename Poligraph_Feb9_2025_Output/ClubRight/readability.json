You have the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Request access to your personal data:</strong> Commonly known as a \u201csubject access request.\u201d This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you:</strong> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>\n<li><strong>Request erasure of your personal data in certain circumstances:</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing, where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>\n<li><strong>Object to processing of your personal data:</strong> Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data (including carrying out profiling based on our legitimate interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your right to object.</li>\n<li><strong>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party:</strong> We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>\n<li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time:</strong> Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>\n<li><strong>Request restriction of processing of your personal data:</strong> This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in one of the following scenarios:\n<ul>\n<li>If you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy.</li>\n<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>\n<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>\n<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. We will respond to your requests within a reasonable timeframe. Please note these rights may be limited in certain circumstances as provided by applicable law.</p>\n<h3>Contact Details</h3>\n<p>We would appreciate the opportunity to directly address any GDPR issues you may have.

You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing, where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\nObject to processing of your personal data: Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data (including carrying out profiling based on our legitimate interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your right to object.\nRequest the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party: We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\nWithdraw consent at any time: Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.

We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\nRequest restriction of processing of your personal data: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in one of the following scenarios:\n\nIf you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy.\nWhere our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.\nWhere you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nYou have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\n\n\nIf you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. We will respond to your requests within a reasonable timeframe.
