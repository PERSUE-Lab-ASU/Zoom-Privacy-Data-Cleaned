Text entered into the chat window is collected, recorded, and used by Pledgeling for its own business purposes, including customer service, as detailed in this Privacy Policy. Our chat messaging service is hosted by our third party vendor, Freshchat/Freshworks, which acts on our exclusive behalf. When we disclose personal information to service providers, including Freshchat/Freshworks, we enter a contract that requires the recipient service provider to both keep that personal information confidential and not to use it for any purpose except performing their obligations to us.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>If you install our Give &amp; Grow app on your Shopify store, we collect the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>Your store name, email address, and unique Shopify merchant identifier.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use the information we collect to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>Associate Give &amp; Grow donations with your Shopify account, so that you can see aggregate data about donations generated by your Give &amp; Grow installation.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Contact you with a sequence of instructional onboarding emails, which you may opt out of at any time.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Provide information about product updates and other news of interest</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We share your information with third parties for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>We share your email address and Give &amp; Grow installation status with our 3rd party email service providers, including Mailgun and Hubspot, so that they can send the onboarding emails and product update news.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shopify Order Data:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>The Give &amp; Grow app (AKA Fashion Makes Change) uses order data to calculate donations on behalf of the shop, or the shop's customer.

We only use the line item detail (SKU, quantity, price) to calculate the donations and then immediately discard all remaining data pertaining to the order.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>If you install our Zoom integration, you will have to create a Pledgeling account in order for it to function. How we use that information is described in the section \u201cInformation from Website Visitors.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once you have a) created a Pledgeling account, b) created a Pledgeling fundraising event, and c) granted us permission to access your Zoom account, we collect the following non-personally identifiable information from Zoom:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Your Zoom User ID (with related access tokens);</p></li>\n<li><p>any Zoom meeting or webinar ID linked to your Pledgeling fundraiser(s).</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use the information we collect from Zoom to associate your Pledgeling account and fundraiser with your Zoom account and any meetings or webinars you host.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>This allows you, from within your Pledgeling account, to create and manage Zoom meetings or webinars in your Zoom account;</p></li>\n<li><p>This allows us to a) show a live \u201cfeed\u201d of donations on guests\u2019 screens during your Zoom event or webinar, b) provide analytics regarding donations made via the integration, and c) add future functionality.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not share your Zoom account or meeting IDs with any third party.</p>\n<p>Although we may request that you install additional third party software in order to make our Zoom integration work, we do not share your information with those third parties.

We (or our mobile service provider) automatically collect your mobile phone number when you use the Mobile Services from a mobile device, such as texting in a keyword like \"DONATE\" to one of our shortcodes. We do not link that phone number to other personal information that we may have, such as name or email address.</p></li>\n  <li><p>If you send text, image, audio, or video to us, that content is stored by us (or our mobile service provider) for a varying length of time, and depending on what you sent, it could include personal information.</p></li>\n  <li><p>If you have opted in to a text messaging campaign with an organization via a form controlled by them, they may send us your phone number and other information so that we can send you a message on their behalf.</p></li>\n  <li><p>If we are processing a message from one mobile phone to another, we (or our mobile service provider) store both the sender and recipient's phone numbers.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Information about your phone and carrier. Prior to delivering a multimedia message (MMS) via the Mobile Services, we (or our mobile service provider) query the carrier's systems in order to collect information about the recipient's mobile carrier and, where possible, their phone make and model. We do this to format the content properly. We (or our mobile service provider) store this information to speed processing of subsequent messages.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use the information we collect to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>Deliver the content you requested</p></li>\n  <li><p>Deliver subsequent messages, if you signed up for recurring messages</p></li>\n  <li><p>Respond to your text with help instructions or confirmation of your opt-out to a recurring message program</p></li>\n  <li><p>Optimize video, image, or audio content for your device and carrier</p></li>\n  <li><p>Record traffic for billing purposes</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We share your information with third parties for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>Phone number information with \"aggregators\" who interface between us and your carrier; in turn, they share this information with your carrier so that we can determine your phone make and model and optimize content for your device.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Message transmission data with our customers for analysis, customer support, billing, proof of performance, and portability if they shift their text messaging programs to another provider.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aggregators and carriers have their own access to message content and information about sending and receiving phone numbers.

We may collect information about the device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifier, phone number, and mobile network information.</p></li>\n  <li><p>App Analytics. We may also use third party tracking services to help us analyze how users use the App and Services. These services collect only the unique device identifier assigned to your mobile device, rather than your name or other personally identifying information, and use it to collect information such as how often users open the App, whether they encountered crashes or problems, tasks performed, buttons clicked, screens viewed, and other actions within the App. We only use this information to improve our App and Services. We do not combine the information generated thereby with your Personal Information and we do not associate you in any way with your device identifier. Only these services know and associate you (on a non-identifiable basis) with your identifier.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use the information we collect to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>Provide the Services on the iOS application</p></li>\n  <li><p>Better understand how visitors are using the iOS application and to improve its utility</p></li>\n  <li><p>Provide customer support</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We share your information with third parties for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>If we use third party services that track user activities on the iOS app, anonymized data about button presses, screens viewed, and other user activity is processed and stored by them. We do not currently use such a service.</p></li>\n  <li><p>If we use third party services to identify and resolve \"bugs,\" data about the issue and your device \u2013 such as the OS version \u2013 is processed and stored by them. We do not currently use such a service.</p></li>\n  <li><p>If you have a support issue, we may store some of your device's unique information to help us resolve the problem. This information may be stored at our customer support service. See \"Information from Website Visitors\" above.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>If a customer is using our APIs (application programming interfaces) to initiate a donation, they send us the same information described in \"Information for Donations\" and we use and share it the same way.</p>\n<p>Note: that customer may have access to your information before they transmitted it to us, so their use of that information is subject to their privacy policy.</p>\n\n\n<p>When we communicate with each other, we collect the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>When we communicate with each other via email, text message, chat, form submission, or other form of written communication, we will collect and store any information that is contained in that message, which could include your name, email address, phone number, and address.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Our third party providers collect and store \"metadata\" about the written communication depending on the communications medium used. In the case of email, this includes your email address , IP address, and host network.</p></li>\n  <li><p>If you sign up for recurring reports, email newsletters, or notifications, you will provide your email address or other unique means of contacting you.</p></li>\n  <li><p>For any phone calls between us, typically for support or sales, we collect your phone number and may link it to other personal information such as name and email address that we either ask for in the course of the call or that already exists in one of our systems. In certain cases our phone service may automatically generate a transcript of the call.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In some cases, our email service Hubspot receives your name and email address when you submit this information to us on our Sites in order to sign up for newsletters. In some cases, Hubspot will determine your location if you interact with emails that you receive from them on behalf of us. Hubspot's Privacy Policy is available <a href=\"https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy\">here</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use the information we collect to facilitate communication between us, answer questions, provide information about our company and products, and provide you with the Services.</p>\n<p>We share your information with our third party communications service providers in order to send email, place phone calls, send texts, chat, send newsletters, or otherwise communicate with you. This includes text that you may enter into our website\u2019s chat messaging service, which is hosted by our third party vendor, Freshchat/Freshworks, acting on our exclusive behalf as further detailed in the \u201cInformation From Website Visitors\u201d section above.</p>\n\n\n<p>We also share your information with third parties for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>We may work with other third parties and service providers not identified above in order to provide you with the Services.

We may share some of your personal information with them to provide the Services, process or deliver information to you, provide support, tailor the features and content of the Services to you, and verify your compliance with your obligations in our Terms of Use. Any third party transmitting, storing, or processing your information may in turn pass your information on to other third parties, such as your bank or credit card company. We expect these third parties to comply with a Privacy Policy equivalent to this one and to undertake appropriate confidentiality and security measures, but their policies are not under our control.</p></li>\n  <li><p>When you use the Services, the Personal Information you provide will be shared with third parties that you authorize to receive such information. If you provided information, such as a mobile phone number or information you filled out on a web form, in order to receive communications from one of our clients, we may share that information with that specific client in order for them to deliver the specific information you requested. You may provide other information to us so that we can forward it on to our clients and charity partners; for instance, if we are hosting a donations page on our charity partners' behalf and they ask for your date of birth. The use of that information is governed by the individual client's Privacy Policy. You may opt out of this sharing at the time of donation.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Social Network logins. We may create interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking services such as Facebook and LinkedIn (\"SNS\") through our Sites and Services. We work with the SNS's application protocol interface (API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SNS on your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, you do not provide us with your user name or password to the SNS, but you will need to log-in to that SNS directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SNS provides us a token that allows the SNS to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. For example, when you click \"Connect\" to grant us access to your Facebook account, we will import your name and other information from Facebook. You can revoke our access to any SNS at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS. The SNS's own privacy policy covers how they use your data.</p></li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Social Network content sharing. Some of our Services may enable you to post content to social networks (SNSs) (e.g., Facebook or Twitter).

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (\"Affiliates\"), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. As of the date of this Privacy Policy, there are no Affiliates.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Corporate Restructuring. We may share some or all of your Personal Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets, solely for the purpose of evaluating and facilitating that transaction, and subject to the receiving party having a Privacy Policy equivalent to this one. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p></li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Other Disclosures. Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Information, we may disclose your personal information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>satisfy a request by a court, law enforcement or governmental authority, such as a court order, warrant, or subpoena;</p></li>\n      <li><p>investigate, assist, or comply with preventing any suspected, actual or potential violation of an applicable law, regulation, or legal process;</p></li>\n      <li><p>protect or defend the rights, property, or safety of Pledgeling, its employees, or other users of the Services;</p></li>\n      <li><p>enforce the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy for the Services, including any investigation of potential violations thereof,</p></li>\n      <li><p>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Services.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>When we use the phrase \"Anonymous Information\" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.</p>\n<p>We may use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you.</p>\n<p>We use the Anonymous Information we collect to analyze how users interact with the Services. We use this information to optimize and improve the Services, track progress towards goals, administer the Services, and gather demographic and analytic information about our user base as a whole.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose Anonymous Information publicly without restriction. We may share aggregated, anonymous information with third parties such as clients, prospective clients, industry trade groups, and the press.
