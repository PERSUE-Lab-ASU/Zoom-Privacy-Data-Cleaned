                <p>To meet global data privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), the organization manager can delete a member’s profile information. We’ve outlined some key details below for both members and managers, but <a href="https://www.mixr.net/contact-us">contact us</a> if you have questions.</p>
                <p>Some background</p>
                <ul class="w-80 mx-auto text-justify">
                    <li>Deletion is permanent – once profile information is removed, it can't be recovered.</li>
                    <li>The organization manager  controls their workspace’s data (we call this customer data). This includes all of the content submitted by members, along with member profile information.</li>
                    <li>When members leave an organization, they may have the right to request that their profile information be deleted by the organization manager. As the data controller, the organization manager is responsible for determining whether profile information requires deletion.</li>
                    <li>The organization manager can delete a member’s profile information after the account is deactivated. An organization manager can also contact MixR to request deletion assistance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can request to delete your profile information directly from MixR.</p>
