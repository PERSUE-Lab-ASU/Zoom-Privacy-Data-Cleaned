{"title": "Privacy Policy | Robin", "byline": null, "dir": null, "lang": "en", "content": "<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><div><p>Last updated May 8th, 2024</p></div><div><p>Welcome to Robin. We take privacy seriously, especially when it comes to data you provide to us.</p><p>This Policy explains how Robin Powered, Inc. (\u201cRobin\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) collects and uses data, including personally identifiable data (\u201cPersonal Data\u201d), and other information we collect from visitors to our website and users of the Robin scheduling platform. Our website and our scheduling platform and related services we provide are referred to collectively as the \u201cService\u201d in this Policy.</p><p>Robin will honor requests for the removal of personal data. Where Robin is the data controller, such as for data collected through the use of our website or responses to communications, Robin will remove your personal data from its systems upon request. Where we are the data processor, such as data sent to Robin platform from customers, we will forward your request to the data controller. All such requests can be sent to <a href=\"mailto:privacy@robinpowered.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">privacy@robinpowered.com</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@robinpowered.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">privacy@robinpowered.com</a>, and we will be happy to help you.</p><p>This Policy applies to information we collect through any version of the Service and to information you send to us.</p><p><strong>This Policy does not apply to:</strong></p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Data collection that happens offline or outside of our Service.</li><li>Any third party, including through any application, content, link or other interaction that may be accessible to you through the Service.</li></ul><p><em>By using the Service, you agree to this Policy and our Terms of Service (including our Acceptable Use Requirements). Some of the data collection and uses described in this Policy are required in order for you to be able to use the Service. Our basis for that collection and use is to be able to provide the Service to you. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. Some of the data collection and use described in this Policy are optional, and our basis for that collection and use is your consent. Where that is the case, we always give you a choice in advance, and you may use the Service even if you have \u201copted out\u201d of the particular use.</em></p></div><div><div><div><p>What information do we collect?</p></div><div><h6>Data you give us</h6><p>As you use the Service, we collect and store information that you provide when you answer questions or fill out forms or engage in other interactions on the Service. This includes places like account registration, contact forms, account profile, and \"personas\".</p><h6>Data collected as you use the Service</h6><p>We automatically collect and store information when you interact with the Service (\"Usage Data\"). By default we limit Usage Data access to Robin and its third party service providers who we use to deliver the Service to you (e.g. hosting). If you approve access by any other third parties, we also share applicable data with them for the purpose approved by you.</p><p>We store and access Usage Data using a few technologies downloaded to your device, such as your computer, browser, tablet, mobile phone, or wearable. This happens whenever you interact with our Service. Usage Data associated with your Personal Data provided via the Service becomes Personal Data too.</p><h6>Usage Data includes things like:</h6><ul role=\"list\"><li>Details about your activities at a Robin location, limited to what you approved upon arrival.</li><li>Ways to identify your device, such as your IP address, UUID, or other unique identifier (\"Device Identifier\"). A Device Identifier is a string that Robin automatically assigns to your Device to access the Service.</li><li>Your Device functionality (e.g. browser, operating system, hardware, and mobile network).</li><li>How you found the Service (e.g. referring website)</li><li>Your activity in the Service, so we can do things like remember you and your preferences.</li><li>Your Device's location.</li><li>General information about your Device (e.g. characteristics, time of day, etc.).</li></ul><h6>Tracking Technology</h6><p>We or our vendors may use a few methods to store or collect Usage Data (\"Tracking Technologies\"). Tracking Technologies may set and change settings on your Device.</p><p>One of the ways we do this is through \"cookies\". A cookie is a small file our Service gives your Device when it accesses the Service. We use cookies to enable functionality, improve Service usage analytics, and market the service. For example, a cookie allows us to keep you logged in during a session rather than asking for a password at every action. Another example is as a security measure to prevent fraudulent activity with your accounts. You can disable or delete cookies on your Device, but parts of the Service may not be functional without them.</p><p>We and our vendors may also use tools like web beacons (\"clear gifs\"), scripts, and images to help manage site content and usage.</p><p>These technologies help us understand the performance and usefulness of content in the Service. We use these insights to improve the content, products or services offered through the Service.</p><p>Tracking Technologies used by our service providers are not covered by this policy. We do not have control over them, but we do screen to make sure they have acceptable policies before integrating.</p><h6>Tracking Consent</h6><p>For our Tracking Technologies that are not required in order for us to provide the Service, we get your consent to our storage and collection Tracking Technologies in a few ways:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Giving you transparent information in this Policy</li><li>Allowing you to choose whether to allow certain third parties to access your data</li><li>Giving you the opportunity to choose to disable cookies.</li></ul><p>Some of our Tracking Technologies are required in order for the Service to function. For example, our use of cookies as a way to improve security through fraud prevention. By using the Service, you are asking us to provide the Service to you, including all of the elements of the Service necessary for it to function as it does.</p><h6>Third Party Tracking</h6><p>Robin may use other Tracking Technologies (some which may not exist yet) in connection with the Service in the future. If we introduce new Tracking Technologies that change the types of data that we collect and the ways in which we use that data, we will update this Policy.</p><p>Third parties (including vendors) may also use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service. They may collect information about your online activities across third party websites or services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. You consent to encountering third party Tracking Technologies as you use our Service. You also accept that this Policy does not apply to Tracking Technologies or practices of third parties.</p><h6>\"Do Not Track\"</h6><p>Some third parties have ways (e.g. Browser do-not-track signals) for users to control how online services collect their information. We do not currently take any action based on these signals, however this may change in the future.</p><h6>Data third parties provide about you</h6><p>We may combine information collected directly from you on our Service with third party records. This information allows us to give you a better experience by customizing content and opportunities to you. Unless disclosed otherwise, combined information becomes Personal Data under Policy.</p><p>Aside from the above, this Policy does not apply to information we receive about you from third parties. This includes if they have used our technology to collect and share information with us. If you have provided data to third parties and have concerns about how they use and share your data, you may wish to contact them to address your concerns.</p><h6>Interactions with third party services</h6><p>Parts of the Service may include certain interactions with third-party websites or applications. This functionality may involve the third-party operator giving us certain information, including Personal Data. When you register with the Service for example, you may have an option to link your account to a third party account (e.g. Google) to help the registration, login and transaction process, or otherwise. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality in our Service, the third-party may send your Personal Data to us. We will treat it as Personal Data under this Policy because we collect it as a result of you using our Service.</p><p>We may also provide third-party sites' interfaces or links in the Service to help you send communications. For example, a share button for emailing links via the Service. These third parties may keep information used or provided in communications or other activities. These third parties' practices are not subject to this Policy. Robin may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.</p><p>When you use third party services, they are responsible for their practices. We can only vouch for our services and policies, and cannot be responsible for their practices. Be sure to review third-party policies before using their tools on our Service.</p><h6>How we handle payments</h6><p>We use third party vendors for credit card transactions and billing when you register to use the Service. All credit card transactions are handled separately by such vendors through their servers. They do not share complete financial account information with Robin. You can find our current payment vendor's privacy policy here: <a href=\"https://stripe.com/us/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>How do we use information we collect?</p></div><div><p><strong>We may use Personal or Usage Data that we collect about you:</strong></p><ol role=\"list\"><li>To give you information and services, or to process transactions you request or agree to receive. This includes sending email or promotional materials on behalf of us or approved third parties.</li><li>To enable you to use the Services' features.</li><li>To process your registration to use the Services, including verifying that your information is active and valid.</li><li>To improve the Services or create new service offerings.

This includes (at our discretion) changes to any of the Services and/or any of the Services' policies.</li><li>To send marketing emails about third party products and services when you have indicated your consent to receive such emails.</li><li>For internal business purposes.</li><li>For purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Policy.</li></ol><h6>Inquiries</h6><p>When you contact us, we will use that information only for reasons connected with your request. Not all information submitted to the Service via a \"contact us\" form or other similar inquiry method may receive a response.</p></div></div><div><div><p>When do we share information with third parties?</p></div><div><p>There are certain situations where we may share information we have collected about you with third parties. For example, when you approve a third party to access your profile. This includes Personal Data as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Policy. We do not share Personal Data collected through the Service with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We also may share non-Personal Data, such as depersonalized, aggregated user statistics, with third parties.</p><p><strong>We may also disclose your information as follows:</strong></p><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>Requested Third Parties:</strong> Our Service may present options to receive certain information or marketing from third parties. You may also have us send (or give access to) certain information to third parties. If you choose to do so, your Personal Data and other information may be disclosed to those third parties. All information you disclose will be subject to the third-party privacy policies and practices.</li><li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Service. A few examples include hosting the Service, analytics, security, and other administrative services. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Data, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Third-party analytics services providers such as Google Analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Data, about you. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them, nor are we responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options. You can read more about Google Analytics at <a href=\"http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose your information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Robin or third parties (including through the enforcement of this Policy, our <a href=\"https://robinpowered.com/assets/Robin_Terms_and_Conditions_10_2019.50b36a67.pdf\"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></a>, and other applicable agreements and policies); or (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g., pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or court orders).

We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process.</li><li><strong>Your use: </strong>The Service may permit you to submit photographs, user profiles, video, audio recordings, graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Data (collectively, \"User Content\"), particularly as part of your profile. We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information to share, including Personal Data, in connection with your User Content, and please keep in mind that you must comply with the Content and Excluded Data portions of our Terms of Service, including our Acceptable Use Policy, in submitting any User Content. Please note that the Company does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on the Service or what others do with information you share with them on the Service. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Service.</li></ul><h6>Third party content and services</h6><p>The Service may contain content that is supplied by third parties, and those third parties may collect Usage Data and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. For example, if you click on a link, the click may take you off the Service onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Data, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party websites and exercise caution in connection with them.</p><h6>Changing information and communication preferences; Retention</h6><p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration.

We take privacy seriously, especially when it comes to data you provide to us.This Policy explains how Robin Powered, Inc. (\u201cRobin\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) collects and uses data, including personally identifiable data (\u201cPersonal Data\u201d), and other information we collect from visitors to our website and users of the Robin scheduling platform. Our website and our scheduling platform and related services we provide are referred to collectively as the \u201cService\u201d in this Policy.Robin will honor requests for the removal of personal data. Where Robin is the data controller, such as for data collected through the use of our website or responses to communications, Robin will remove your personal data from its systems upon request. Where we are the data processor, such as data sent to Robin platform from customers, we will forward your request to the data controller. All such requests can be sent to privacy@robinpowered.com.If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us at privacy@robinpowered.com, and we will be happy to help you.This Policy applies to information we collect through any version of the Service and to information you send to us.This Policy does not apply to:Data collection that happens offline or outside of our Service.Any third party, including through any application, content, link or other interaction that may be accessible to you through the Service.By using the Service, you agree to this Policy and our Terms of Service (including our Acceptable Use Requirements). Some of the data collection and uses described in this Policy are required in order for you to be able to use the Service. Our basis for that collection and use is to be able to provide the Service to you. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. Some of the data collection and use described in this Policy are optional, and our basis for that collection and use is your consent. Where that is the case, we always give you a choice in advance, and you may use the Service even if you have \u201copted out\u201d of the particular use.What information do we collect?Data you give usAs you use the Service, we collect and store information that you provide when you answer questions or fill out forms or engage in other interactions on the Service. This includes places like account registration, contact forms, account profile, and \"personas\".Data collected as you use the ServiceWe automatically collect and store information when you interact with the Service (\"Usage Data\"). By default we limit Usage Data access to Robin and its third party service providers who we use to deliver the Service to you (e.g. hosting). If you approve access by any other third parties, we also share applicable data with them for the purpose approved by you.We store and access Usage Data using a few technologies downloaded to your device, such as your computer, browser, tablet, mobile phone, or wearable. This happens whenever you interact with our Service. Usage Data associated with your Personal Data provided via the Service becomes Personal Data too.Usage Data includes things like:Details about your activities at a Robin location, limited to what you approved upon arrival.Ways to identify your device, such as your IP address, UUID, or other unique identifier (\"Device Identifier\"). A Device Identifier is a string that Robin automatically assigns to your Device to access the Service.Your Device functionality (e.g. browser, operating system, hardware, and mobile network).How you found the Service (e.g. referring website)Your activity in the Service, so we can do things like remember you and your preferences.Your Device's location.General information about your Device (e.g. characteristics, time of day, etc.).Tracking TechnologyWe or our vendors may use a few methods to store or collect Usage Data (\"Tracking Technologies\"). Tracking Technologies may set and change settings on your Device.One of the ways we do this is through \"cookies\". A cookie is a small file our Service gives your Device when it accesses the Service. We use cookies to enable functionality, improve Service usage analytics, and market the service. For example, a cookie allows us to keep you logged in during a session rather than asking for a password at every action. Another example is as a security measure to prevent fraudulent activity with your accounts. You can disable or delete cookies on your Device, but parts of the Service may not be functional without them.We and our vendors may also use tools like web beacons (\"clear gifs\"), scripts, and images to help manage site content and usage.These technologies help us understand the performance and usefulness of content in the Service. We use these insights to improve the content, products or services offered through the Service.Tracking Technologies used by our service providers are not covered by this policy. We do not have control over them, but we do screen to make sure they have acceptable policies before integrating.Tracking ConsentFor our Tracking Technologies that are not required in order for us to provide the Service, we get your consent to our storage and collection Tracking Technologies in a few ways:Giving you transparent information in this PolicyAllowing you to choose whether to allow certain third parties to access your dataGiving you the opportunity to choose to disable cookies.Some of our Tracking Technologies are required in order for the Service to function. For example, our use of cookies as a way to improve security through fraud prevention. By using the Service, you are asking us to provide the Service to you, including all of the elements of the Service necessary for it to function as it does.Third Party TrackingRobin may use other Tracking Technologies (some which may not exist yet) in connection with the Service in the future. If we introduce new Tracking Technologies that change the types of data that we collect and the ways in which we use that data, we will update this Policy.Third parties (including vendors) may also use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service. They may collect information about your online activities across third party websites or services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. You consent to encountering third party Tracking Technologies as you use our Service. You also accept that this Policy does not apply to Tracking Technologies or practices of third parties.\"Do Not Track\"Some third parties have ways (e.g. Browser do-not-track signals) for users to control how online services collect their information. We do not currently take any action based on these signals, however this may change in the future.Data third parties provide about youWe may combine information collected directly from you on our Service with third party records. This information allows us to give you a better experience by customizing content and opportunities to you. Unless disclosed otherwise, combined information becomes Personal Data under Policy.Aside from the above, this Policy does not apply to information we receive about you from third parties. This includes if they have used our technology to collect and share information with us. If you have provided data to third parties and have concerns about how they use and share your data, you may wish to contact them to address your concerns.Interactions with third party servicesParts of the Service may include certain interactions with third-party websites or applications. This functionality may involve the third-party operator giving us certain information, including Personal Data. When you register with the Service for example, you may have an option to link your account to a third party account (e.g. Google) to help the registration, login and transaction process, or otherwise. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality in our Service, the third-party may send your Personal Data to us. We will treat it as Personal Data under this Policy because we collect it as a result of you using our Service.We may also provide third-party sites' interfaces or links in the Service to help you send communications. For example, a share button for emailing links via the Service. These third parties may keep information used or provided in communications or other activities. These third parties' practices are not subject to this Policy. Robin may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.When you use third party services, they are responsible for their practices. We can only vouch for our services and policies, and cannot be responsible for their practices. Be sure to review third-party policies before using their tools on our Service.How we handle paymentsWe use third party vendors for credit card transactions and billing when you register to use the Service. All credit card transactions are handled separately by such vendors through their servers. They do not share complete financial account information with Robin. You can find our current payment vendor's privacy policy here: https://stripe.com/us/privacy.How do we use information we collect?We may use Personal or Usage Data that we collect about you:To give you information and services, or to process transactions you request or agree to receive. This includes sending email or promotional materials on behalf of us or approved third parties.To enable you to use the Services' features.To process your registration to use the Services, including verifying that your information is active and valid.To improve the Services or create new service offerings.

Not all information submitted to the Service via a \"contact us\" form or other similar inquiry method may receive a response.When do we share information with third parties?There are certain situations where we may share information we have collected about you with third parties. For example, when you approve a third party to access your profile. This includes Personal Data as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Policy. We do not share Personal Data collected through the Service with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We also may share non-Personal Data, such as depersonalized, aggregated user statistics, with third parties.We may also disclose your information as follows:Requested Third Parties: Our Service may present options to receive certain information or marketing from third parties. You may also have us send (or give access to) certain information to third parties. If you choose to do so, your Personal Data and other information may be disclosed to those third parties. All information you disclose will be subject to the third-party privacy policies and practices.Service Providers: We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Service. A few examples include hosting the Service, analytics, security, and other administrative services. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Data, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Third-party analytics services providers such as Google Analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Data, about you. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them, nor are we responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options. You can read more about Google Analytics at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.Legal Requirements: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose your information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Robin or third parties (including through the enforcement of this Policy, our Terms of Service, and other applicable agreements and policies); or (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g., pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or court orders). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we have complete discretion in electing to make or not make such disclosures, and to contest or not contest requests for such disclosures, without notice to you.Business Transfers: We may share your Personal Data with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates (\"Affiliates\"). We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process.Your use: The Service may permit you to submit photographs, user profiles, video, audio recordings, graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Data (collectively, \"User Content\"), particularly as part of your profile. We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information to share, including Personal Data, in connection with your User Content, and please keep in mind that you must comply with the Content and Excluded Data portions of our Terms of Service, including our Acceptable Use Policy, in submitting any User Content. Please note that the Company does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on the Service or what others do with information you share with them on the Service. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Service.Third party content and servicesThe Service may contain content that is supplied by third parties, and those third parties may collect Usage Data and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. For example, if you click on a link, the click may take you off the Service onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Data, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.

The GDPR enhances EU individuals\u2019 privacy rights and places significantly enhanced obligations on organizations handling data.The GDPR regulates the processing of a data subject\u2019s personal data in the EU including its collection, storage and transfer or use. The GDPR gives data subjects more rights and control over their data by regulating how we should handle and store any personal data they collect.The EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) went into effect May 25, 2018. Here's what you need to know about Robin\u2019s GDPR compliance:Robin is a Processor under GDPR. Data Protection and Data Transfer Agreements are available for customers subject to GDPR. Account administrators may request updated agreements via gdpr@robinpowered.com.We\u2019ve engaged third party compliance reviews through Sphaerist Advisory and TrustArc's GDPR Priorities Assessment to ensure legal agreements, processes, and data-governance are compliant. These changes are already underway, and will be completed by the time GDPR takes effect.As part of this process, we\u2019ve added better explanations for how Robin uses cookies throughout the apps. You can find more information on cookies in our help center.Rights Under the GDPRThe GDPR grants 7 fundamental rights to data subjects. These are:Right to be informed \u2014 Entities must be transparent in how they are using personal data and must inform data subjects of this.Right of access \u2014 Data subjects will have the right to know what personal data is held about them and how it is processed.Right of rectification \u2014 Where reasonably possible, data subjects will be entitled to have personal data rectified/edited if they feel that it is inaccurate or incomplete.Right to erasure \u2014 This is also sometimes referred to as \u2018the right to be forgotten\u2019, data subjects have the right to have their personal data permanently deleted upon their request and they do not have to provide a reason for the request.Right to restrict processing \u2014 Data subjects have the right to block processing of their personal data.Right to data portability \u2014 Where reasonably possible, data subjects have the right to retain and reuse their personal data for their own purpose.Right to object \u2014 In certain circumstances, data subjects are entitled to object to their personal data being used. This includes, if personal data is used for the purpose of direct marketing, scientific and historical research, or for the performance of a task in the public interest.Subject Access Request (SAR)Any citizen of the European Union can submit a SAR. At Robin this can be done via email to privacy@robinpowered.com.We also monitor the guidance around GDPR compliance from privacy-related regulatory bodies and update our product features and contractual commitments accordingly. We\u2019ll provide you with regular updates so that you\u2019re always current.California Privacy RightsThis section provides additional details about the personal information Robin collects about California consumers and the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or \u201cCCPA.\u201dFor more details about the personal information we have collected over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see the What information do we collect? section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How do we use information we collect? section above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the When do we share information with third parties? section above. Robin does not sell (as such term is defined in the CCPA) the personal information we collect (and will not sell it without providing a right to opt out). Robin or our vendors may use methods to store or collect Usage Data as explained in the Tracking Technologies section above.Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of personal information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information), to delete their personal information, to opt out of any \u201csales\u201d that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.California consumers may make a request pursuant to their rights under the CCPA by contacting us at privacy@robinpowered.com. We will verify your request using the information associated with your account, including email address. Government identification may be required.
