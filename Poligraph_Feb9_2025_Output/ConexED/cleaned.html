We are committed to being transparent and open. This Privacy Policy explains generally how we receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.</p><p>Except as set forth below, personally identifiable data you enter within the service is not made available or distributed to third parties, except with your express consent or at your express direction. In particular, ConexED will not give, sell or provide access to your personal information to any company, individual or organization for its use in marketing or commercial solicitation or for any other purpose, except with your express consent, at your direction, as is necessary for the operation of this site, or pursuant to one of the exceptions listed below.</p><h1>Exceptions to the Privacy Policy</h1><p>There are limited exceptions to the ConexED privacy policy. When required by law to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, regulation or court order, ConexED will supply such information contained in your ConexED account as ConexED reasonably determines, based on the advice of counsel, it is legally required to supply. In addition, ConexED may release specific information relevant to special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others or an attempted breach of security on the ConexED site.</p><h1>What Information Do We Collect About You and Why?</h1><p>We may collect information about you directly from you and from third parties, as well as automatically through your use of our Site or Services.</p><h2>Information We Collect Directly From You</h2><p>Certain areas and features of ConexED may require registration. To register you must provide your email address and a password. We also may collect additional optional information from you, including your name, location, and phone number; however, you are not required to provide us with this information.</p><p>When using ConexED to communicate with College Counselors, Faculty or Staff via an online meeting, ConexED includes an option to record the meeting, including webcam audio and video and any shared screens. These recordings are used for auditing, training and quality assurance purposes and are never shared with anyone other than the parties that attend the meeting. All parties attending a meeting must agree in order to release recordings as viewable by any other party.</p><h2>Information We Collect About You from Social Networking Sites</h2><p>Some ConexED institutions allow login through Facebook, LinkedIn, Google or your institution’s Learning Management System (LMS). By logging in through Facebook, LinkedIn, Google or your institution’s Learning Management System (LMS), you are granting us access to your email address, your profile picture (if applicable) and first and last name. We store the information that we receive from Facebook, LinkedIn, Google or your institution’s Learning Management System (LMS) with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.</p><p>When using ConexED’s Zoom integration, we collect a unique ID from Zoom which uniquely links your ConexED and Zoom accounts so that we may create and update meetings. We also collect a unique and temporary set of credentials known as OAuth tokens which you may revoke at any time through the ConexED application or your Zoom account settings.</p><h2>Information We Collect Automatically</h2><p>We may automatically collect the following information about your use of our Site or Services through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; the length of time you visit our Site and or use our Services; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Site, and the following: access time, browser type, domain name, IP address, page views and referring URL.</p><p>ConexED’s Zoom integration will automatically collect the start and end time of any Zoom meetings which were created as the result of an appointment scheduled through ConexED. When you first join the Zoom meeting, our system will automatically record this time as the “actual start time” of the meeting. Similarly, when everyone has disconnected and the meeting has ended, our system will automatically record this time as the “actual end time” of the meeting.</p><h2>Reasons We Collect Your Personal Identifying Information</h2><p>ConexED collects personal information from you primarily for three reasons. The first reason is to perform a task on ConexED, such as connecting you to an appropriate College Counselor as requested by you. The second reason is to enable you to submit in a convenient and efficient manner information that is likely to be needed when you consult with a counselor. The third reason is to enable ConexED to respond to your questions or contact you when necessary in connection with the functioning of ConexED. When the effective functioning of a ConexED module does not require personal information, none is collected, and any such module can be accessed without opening an account or providing any personal data.</p><p>When you log on to ConexED, your browser will automatically transmit to ConexED’s server the IP address of your computer and type of browser you are using. Although your browser transmits the IP address of your computer, ConexED does not associate this IP address with any personally identifiable information regarding you.</p><p>ConexED does not collect any personally identifiable information other than what users submit and their browsers transmit.</p><p>Your Zoom integration ID and OAuth tokens are required to create and update meetings on your behalf. The capabilities of these credentials are limited only to the ability to create meetings, update meetings, and receive notifications about when those meetings were started and ended. You will have the opportunity to review and approve or reject the requested Zoom capabilities before allowing us to obtain these credentials.</p><h2>Ways In Which Personal Identifying Information May Be Used</h2><p>ConexED will use your personal identifying information to complete the following forms, to obtain information for you and to effect transactions on your behalf, in each case only upon your instructions to do so:</p><ul role="list"><li>Request for counseling appointment.</li><li>Communication with counseling staff.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Your personal identifying information may also be used for the following purposes:</p><ul role="list"><li>We may use your identifying information to help diagnose problems with ConexED’s server and to administer the ConexED website.</li><li>Summary data representing a compilation of aggregate data representing ConexED users may be collected by ConexED and provided to various entities including colleges and other educational institutions represented on ConexED. NO PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE AS PART OF THESE SUMMARY REPORTS. Some examples of summary data are the number of monthly visitors to the site, the number of counseling appointments provided over ConexED, and the ConexED functions utilized by students in certain demographic categories.</li></ul><h2>With Whom Personal Identifying Information May Be Shared</h2><p>Any time you request that we perform a task that involves a transfer of data, the data related to the performance of that task will be made available to a recipient you designate or to a service provider assisting us in completing that task.</p><h1>Security Measures To Prevent Misuse Of Information Entrusted To Conexed</h1><p>ConexED causes the data you input to be encrypted when in route between your browser and the ConexED server and when in route between the ConexED server and some other browser or server. This practice helps prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting and gaining access to your private data during transmission over the Internet. ConexED uses 128-bit, Secure Socket Layer encryption supported by all common browsers.</p><p>Data residing on the ConexED server is password protected, and access is provided only to the account holder who created the password, anyone to whom that account holder entrusted the password, authorized staff of the Institution, and those employees of ConexED who require such access to administer and maintain the ConexED system or to provide requested customer support to users of ConexED. Each ConexED employee who has access to the data residing on the ConexED server has agreed in writing to respect the privacy of all such personal data.</p><h1>Cookies</h1><p>A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to a user’s computer, which may then be stored on its hard drive. ConexED uses cookies to remember you and keep track of your session when you are logged on to ConexED. Cookies enable you to maintain continuity as you move from page to page on ConexED and to avoid the nuisance of being asked to provide the same information repeatedly. Cookies also allow us to make sure that only your browser can exchange information regarding your account with our servers.</p><p>The cookies used by ConexED are set when you log on to ConexED and are erased when you log off ConexED or completely close your browser. No cookies are transferred to your computer if you do not log on to ConexED. If you click the “Remember Me” box on the log-in page, the cookie will persist for 30 days after closing your browser session. Cookies cannot be used to steal personal information or to gain access to information that you did not directly provide.</p><p>ConexED hosts links to other sites or resources, and you may link to one of those sites or resources for a variety of purposes, such as visiting an official college website or researching career and employment information. These sites and resources have privacy policies that may differ from that of ConexED, and for your protection, we recommend that you read and understand the privacy policy at any website prior to providing personal information on that website. ConexED is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any websites to which ConexED links or for the conduct of persons operating those websites. ConexED does not have control over such external sites and resources, and shall not be liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. In addition, ConexED shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, advertising, products or materials on or available through any such site or resource.</p><h1>Modifying And Deleting Your Information</h1><p>You may update, otherwise modify or delete from the data stored on ConexED any personal information you previously provided. To modify personal information, submit a request to ConexED via email at <a href="mailto:info@conexed.com">info@conexed.com</a> or through ConexED’s support ticketing system at <a href="https://support.conexed.com/">https://support.conexed.com/</a>.</p><h2>European Data Protection Specific Information</h2><h3>Data Subjects Rights</h3><p>If you are in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, your rights in relation to your personal data processed by us as a controller specifically include:</p><ul role="list"><li>The right to access – You have the right to request ConexED for copies of your personal data.</li><li>The right to rectification – You have the right to request that ConexED correct any information you believe is inaccurate.

If changes are made to this Privacy Policy concerning use of your personal information, we will notify you by means of a message to the email address provided by you when registering with ConexED.
