This includes processing for statistical, management and business development purposes, for example seeking your thoughts and opinions on the services we provide to you and notifying you about any changes to our products and services. \u00a0It may also include processing for marketing purposes, such as providing you with information related to any our products or services which we think may interest you (subject to your rights set out in section 3). 2.1.3.\twe may also process your personal data for other purposes but (unless this is in circumstances where the reason for doing so is compatible with the original purpose or we have other lawful grounds for doing so) this will usually only happen where we have obtained your specific consent. \u00a0If that is the case, then you also have the right to withdraw your consent, which you can do by contacting us in writing at the address set out in section 8. 2.1.4.\tPlease note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. \u00a02.2.\tWhere we are acting as a data processor:2.2.1.\t the business that has provided your personal information to us is itself responsible for ensuring that it has lawful grounds to do so and for providing us with instructions as to the specific types of personal data we are permitted to process; and2.2.2.\tthe ground(s) upon which that business is entitled to process your personal data is determined by them not us (and may vary from organisation to organisation); and2.2.3.\tunless Data Protection Legislation requires or permits otherwise, we will process that personal data only in accordance with their instructions and for the purposes of enabling us to perform our obligations under our contract with them.3.\tYour individual rights Access to information3.1.\tWe want to make sure that you are fully aware of your data protection rights. \u00a0These are set out in summary form in sections 3.5 - 3.13 below and apply to us in our role as a data controller. \u00a0You can also obtain more detailed information about your rights under the Data Protection Legislation from the Information Commissioner\u2019s office by clicking on this link - www.ico.org.uk. Our contact details for the purposes of requesting access to your personal data or exercising any of your other data protection rights are in section 8.3.2.\tPlease note that, in order to comply with any request, we may first require you to verify your identity and we will normally fulfil any request by sending information electronically, unless the request expressly specifies a different method. \u00a0We will not charge a fee for responding to your request, other than in circumstances where you make a request which is manifestly unfounded or excessive or you request further copies of information which we have already provided to you. \u00a0In that case, we are entitled to charge a reasonable administrative fee. 3.3.\tPlease also note that, where we are acting as a data processor, we will not be responsible for answering your request ourselves but will pass it onto the business organisation that provided us with your personal data (in their role as data controller) so that they may then determine how best to respond to it.Timescales for responding3.4.\tIf you make a request of us (in our role as a data controller), we will normally have one month to respond to you. \u00a0If we need something from you to be able to deal with your request (e.g. an ID document), the time limit will begin once we have received this. \u00a0This time limit may also be extended in certain circumstances so, if there is any reason why our response to you might take longer than a month, we will let you know.Summary of your rights3.5.\tWithdrawal of consent - where our legal ground for processing your personal data is based upon you having given us your consent to do so, you have the right, at any time, to withdraw that consent (please see section 2.1.3 above). \u00a0Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. \u00a03.6.\tRight to be informed \u2013 you are entitled to be provided with information about certain matters relating to the processing of your personal data and for that information to be provided within certain timescales.
