  <h3 class="iub-subheading iub-subheading-legal-basis-of-processing">
  Legal basis of processing
</h3>
<p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>
  <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
  <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
  <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
  <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>


  <h3 class="iub-subheading iub-subheading-legal-time">
  Further information about retention time
</h3>

<p>Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
  <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of  this document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br><br>
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>


  <h3 id="rights_subjects">The rights of Users based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
<p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>

<p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following, to the extent permitted by law:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Withdraw their consent at any time.</strong> Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.</li>
  <li><strong>Object to processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to object to the processing of their Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent.</li>
  <li><strong>Access their Data.</strong> Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.</li>
  <li><strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other than storing it.
</li>
  <li><strong>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</strong> Users have the right to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.</li>
  <li><strong>Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller.</strong> Users have the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.</li>
  <li><strong>Lodge a complaint.</strong> Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection authority.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis for Data transfers abroad including to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
</p>

<h4 class="iub-subheading iub-subheading-legal-right-to-object">
  Details about the right to object to processing
</h4>
<p><strong>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time, free of charge and without providing any justification. Where the User objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the Personal Data will no longer be processed for such purposes. To learn whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document. </strong></p>

<h4 class="iub-subheading iub-subheading-legal-how-to-exercise">
  How to exercise these rights
</h4>

<p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through  the contact details provided in this document. Such requests are free of charge and will be answered by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month, providing Users with the information required by law. Any rectification or erasure of Personal Data or restriction of processing will be communicated by the Owner to each recipient, if any, to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. At the Users’ request, the Owner will inform them about those recipients.</p>

  How to exercise your privacy rights under US state laws
</h3>

<p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your request to us by contacting us via the contact details provided in this document.</p>
<p>For us to respond to your request, we must know who you are. We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the Personal Information in our possession relates to you. You are not required to create an account with us to submit your request. We will use any Personal Information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for verification and shall not further disclose the Personal Information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.</p>
<p>If you are an adult, you can make a request on behalf of a child under your parental authority.</p>


<h4>How to exercise your rights to opt out</h4>

<p>If you want to submit requests to opt out of Sale or Sharing and Targeted Advertising activities via a user-enabled <b>global privacy control</b>, such as for example the Global Privacy Control (“<a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" target="_blank">GPC</a>”), you are free to do so and we will abide by such request in a frictionless manner.</p>


<h4>How and when we are expected to handle your request</h4>
<p>We will respond to your request without undue delay, but in all cases within the timeframe required by applicable law. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need.</p>
<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain to you the reasons behind our denial (where envisaged by applicable law you may then contact the relevant authority to submit a complaint).</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive and in all other cases where it is permitted by the applicable law. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind them.</p>
