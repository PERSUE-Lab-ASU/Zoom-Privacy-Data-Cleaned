Any future changes to JobScore’s Privacy Policy will be posted on the JobScore website prior to the changes taking effect.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading mobile--text-align-left desktop--text-align-left" level="2">Information JobScore Collects</h2>


<p class="mobile--text-align-left desktop--text-align-left">JobScore collects a wide variety of Information as described in this Section that it uses to provide its membership services and general information services on its website (“Services”). JobScore generally provides Services to two “groups,” Employers and Jobseekers. Each is required to go through an enrollment process in order to use the Services. In doing so, JobScore requires certain information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, job description, resume information, role(s), employment preferences, time zone, and/or credit card information (if you are using a paid-for service). JobScore also collects information related to your overall use of the Services. JobScore also collects information related to discussions, chats, and other correspondence through the JobScore website. We may collect the following personal information from you about your contacts or friends: email address, mailing address, phone number, education history, and job history.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading mobile--text-align-left desktop--text-align-left" level="2">Information Use</h2>


<p class="mobile--text-align-left desktop--text-align-left">JobScore provides job matching services for Employers and Jobseekers. Employers may use the Services as a way to manage the process of soliciting Jobseekers and managing the hiring process. Jobseekers may use the Services to apply for specific jobs and also to be matched to other potential jobs. For a complete description of the Services, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jobscore.com/">www.jobscore.com</a>. We use the information we collect from you about your contacts or friends: to deliver the Services to you whether you are an Employer or Jobseeker, to send you marketing communications when appropriate, to communicate with you about changes to the Services, and to notify you about any changes to our policies and Terms. We also use this collected information to respond to you when you contact us. If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us at privacy@jobscore.com</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading mobile--text-align-left desktop--text-align-left" level="2">Sharing of Information</h2>


<p class="mobile--text-align-left desktop--text-align-left">The Employer’s job positions and corresponding information will be accessible by anyone through the use of the Services. When an individual applies to a job at a JobScore Network employer, JobScore will share a Jobseeker’s information with the Employer. During the time that a new Jobseeker is under active consideration for a particular position, his/her information will not be generally available for viewing through the Services. After the applicable Employer’s specific job position is no longer considered “active” by JobScore, the Jobseekers that applied to the applicable position will have their data generally available for presentation to other entities that JobScore thinks may have interest in based on collected preference information and system usage patterns. Jobseekers who are already users of the Services prior to the posting of a position by an Employer that they apply for would have their information generally available through the Services regardless of whether they are under active consideration by one or more Employers. If a Jobseeker posts his/her information to the Services outside of a specific position listed by an Employer, the Jobseeker’s information will also generally be available through the use of the Services. JobScore will notify a Jobseeker by e-mail after an Employer has accessed his/her information.</p>


<p class="mobile--text-align-left desktop--text-align-left">JobScore may also send newsletters and email notifications of promotions or other new information at JobScore and other information that JobScore thinks may be of interest. JobScore will only share your credit card information with a credit card and/or shipping processor for the limited purpose of processing your credit card transaction. Your credit card information is never generally accessible to third parties through the use of the Services. JobScore may also enter into agreements with third parties to assist JobScore with the processing of information and the facilitation of JobScore’s Services. In addition, JobScore may enter into partnerships with third parties that provide products and services related to JobScore’s Services that may be of interest to you (“Partners”) and would therefore share non-financial information with such Partners.</p>

JobScore may also use any information it collects to improve the Services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this privacy policy, JobScore use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional-requirements-for-specific-api-scopes" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements. JobScore may also use any information it collects from you for summary and statistical purposes and may share the foregoing to third parties, even if an Employer or Jobseeker Opts-Out. The summary and statistical information will not contain any name and contact information.</p>
