<p>The following additional terms apply to you if you reside in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). To the extent of any inconsistency, the following terms take precedence over the terms in our Privacy Policy in relation to personal data that is collected and/or held relating to individuals (i.e., data subjects) residing in the EU/EEA.</p>
<p>The EU/EEA’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs our processing (as defined under the GDPR) of your personal data, as well as your rights regarding the same. As used in this Addendum, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>
<p>“Breach”, "data controller", “data processor”, “Data Protection Authority”, "data subject", “data subject rights”, “Member State”, “personal data”, “personal data breach”, "processing" (and "process") (regardless of whether capitalized herein) have the meanings given to them in GDPR.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc131685742"></a><u>Data controller; processing</u></h3>
<p>We are a data controller of your personal data.&nbsp; GDPR sets forth specific obligations of a data processor and data controller in each of these roles.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc131685743"></a><u>Lawful Basis for our Processing of Your Personal Data.</u></h3>
<p>As the data controller, we are responsible for establishing a lawful basis for the processing of your personal data. We rely on our legitimate interests under GDPR Article 6 in order to engage in the processing of your personal data. This means that we have a legitimate interest in receiving and processing your personal data in order to provide our Services. We may, in some cases, also rely on obtaining your consent under GDPR Article 6 as the lawful basis of their processing of your personal data. If so, this means that we have requested your explicit consent (or “opt-in”) to their processing of your personal data.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc131685744"></a><u>Data Protection Officer</u><u>.</u></h3>
<p>We have appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc131685745"></a><u>Individual Rights</u></h3>
<p>As also noted in our Privacy Policy, you may make the following requests from us as the data controller. In each case these rights are subject to restrictions and/or exceptions as specified in the GDPR. The following is a summary of your rights:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The right of access, enabling you to receive a copy of your personal data</li>
<li>The right to rectification, enabling you to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold about you</li>
<li>The right to erasure, enabling you to ask us to delete your personal data in certain circumstances</li>
<li>The right to restrict processing, enabling you to ask us to halt the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances</li>
<li>The right to object, enabling you to object to us processing your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), and</li>
<li>The right to data portability, enabling you to request us to transmit personal data that you have provided to us to a third party without hindrance, or to give you a copy of it so that you can transmit it to a third party, where technically feasible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under GDPR, a data subject also has the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Authority, in particular in the Member State of the data subject’s residence, place of work or place of an alleged infringement, if the data subject considers that the processing of the personal data infringes the GDPR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information provided in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the GDPR specifies when the data controller may refuse your request where there is a basis to do so in law, or if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc131685746"></a><u>Special Categories of Personal Data</u></h3>
<p>Our Services do not require the collection or processing of any sensitive personal data or sensitive information, as defined in GDPR (e.g., racial, ethnical origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, etc.). We may nevertheless collect such sensitive personal data about you or we may collect it incidentally if you provide such data to us. By providing any sensitive personal data or by providing information by a recording, you consent to our collection of such information, however, we do not require or use such data to provide our Services.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc131685747"></a><u>International Transfers of Data</u></h3>
<p>Personal Information originating in the EU/EEA may be accessed and/or processed in a limited manner outside of the EEA. We adhere to the GDPR where it applies to our Services. Where your personal data is processed outside of the EEA, we will put in place appropriate safeguards. Where appropriate, we may enter into Standard Contractual Clauses with importers or processors and/or other relevant third parties for the transfer of your personal data and may carry out a risk assessment and/or take necessary security measures in order to fulfill our obligations under GDPR.</p>
<p>If we determine we are unable to provide equivalent protection of your personal data, including by entry into the Standard Contractual Clauses, we may seek to rely on derogations authorized by the GDPR, including the derogation of consent/contract/request of data subject. If relying on your consent, we will seek your explicit consent in advance.</p>
