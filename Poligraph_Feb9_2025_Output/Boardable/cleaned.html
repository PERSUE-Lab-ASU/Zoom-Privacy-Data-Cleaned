<li>Communications, such as the information associated with your requests or inquiries, including for support, assistance, or order information, and any feedback you provide when you communicate with us. We and our service provider may record or monitor any call or web chat you have with us for quality control or training purposes, to enforce our rights, or as otherwise permitted by law.</li>
</ul>



<p>Unless we specifically request it, we ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Services, or otherwise to us.</p>



<p>We obtain personal information from a variety of sources, including the sources described below.</p>



<p><strong>A.&nbsp;Information Collected Automatically</strong>. The Company, our service providers, and advertising partners may also automatically log information about you and your device when you visit our Sites or App, for example, (i) “<strong>online activity information</strong>,” such as the website you visited before browsing to the Services, pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and duration of access; and (ii) “<strong>device information</strong>,” such as your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, wireless carrier, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, IP address, unique identifiers, and general location information such as city, state, or geographic area. Gathering this type of information helps us ensure our Services work correctly and supports analytic efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>EXAMPLES</em></strong></p>



<p>Like many online services, we use cookies and similar technologies to facilitate some of the automatic data collection described above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A “cookie” is a unique numeric code that we transfer to your computer so that we can keep track of your interests and/or preferences and recognize you as a return visitor to the Sites. We may use these technologies to understand the ways visitors use our Sites, to support the features and functionality of our Services, and to personalize your experience when you use our Sites. For more information, please visit our Cookie Policy.</p>



<p>We use pixel tags and cookies in our marketing efforts so that we can track your interaction with our messages, such as when you open the email or click a URL link embedded within them. When recipients click on one of those URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on a Company website. We use tools like pixel tags and cookies so that we can determine interest in particular topics and measure and improve the effectiveness of our communications.</p>



<p>We may use flash cookies, or locally-stored objects, which are used on websites for purposes similar to cookies but allow storage of a larger amount of data.</p>



<p>We may use local storage, which is used to save data on a visitor’s device. We use data from local storage to turn on web navigation, store multimedia preferences, customize what we show you based on your past interactions with our services, remember your preferences, and measure ad effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We may use session-replay technologies, which are third-party software used to record a video replay of users’ interactions with the Sites and App. The video replay may include users’ clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, mobile app touches, typing, and other activity taken during the session. We use these replays for research and development purposes, such as to help us troubleshoot problems with the Sites and App, understand how users interact with same, and identify areas for improvement.</p>



<p>When you download or use our App, or access one of our mobile-optimized websites, we may receive the device information described above, including a unique identifier for your device.</p>



<p>We also use software development kits, or SDKs, are third-party computer codes used in connection with our App for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our App, to add features or functionality to our App, or to facilitate online advertising. SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly via our App.</p>



<p><strong>B.&nbsp;Information Collected from Social Media</strong>. Our services include social media features, which may collect your personal information. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the organization providing it. For example, if you create or log into your Company account through a third-party social networking site, we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information, picture, and friends, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking site.</p>



<p><strong>C.&nbsp;Information Collected from Other Sources</strong>. The Company may also collect information about you from other sources to, for example, help the Company correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our services, prevent or detect fraud, and to otherwise provide the Company’s services.

Referrals</strong>. Users of the Services may have the opportunity to add or refer colleagues or other contacts to us and share their contact information. Please do not provide us with someone’s contact information unless you have their permission to do so.</p>

<p><strong>F. Cookies</strong>. Most browsers let you remove and/or stop accepting cookies from the websites you visit. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser’s settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Services and our Sites may not work properly. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>G. Analytics.</strong> The Sites use Google Analytics to help us analyze how the Sites are being accessed and used. You can learn more about Google Analytics cookies by clicking <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> and about how Google protects your data by clicking <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. To opt-out of Google Analytics, you can download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, available <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
