This California Supplemental Privacy Notice (“California Privacy Notice”) complements the information presented in the Privacy Policy and applies exclusively to California residents. This notice outlines your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and other applicable California laws. Terms defined in the CCPA retain their meaning in this document.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">While we fulfill the CCPA's requirement to present the following categories, please consult our Privacy Policy for illustrative examples and additional details about our data collection and usage, which remain unaffected by this notice.</p><p>Understanding the CCPA</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The CCPA is a California law that grants specific rights to California residents regarding their personal information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">According to the CCPA, California residents (referred to as "consumers") possess the following rights:</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• The right to request information about the collection and use of personal information over the past 12 months.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• The right to request the deletion of personal information collected and retained by us, subject to exceptions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• The right to opt out of the sale of personal information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• The right not to be discriminated against for exercising privacy rights under the CCPA.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Further instructions on how to exercise these rights are provided below.<br>As per the CCPA, "personal information" refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked to, directly or indirectly, a particular consumer or household. Personal information excludes publicly available information or deidentified and aggregated consumer information. The CCPA does not apply to personal information covered by specific sector-specific privacy laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FRCA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994, or health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), including clinical trial data.</p><p>Scope of the California Privacy Notice</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Utobo's services are intended for use by our customers, and the majority of personal information processing occurs at their direction. This California Privacy Notice solely pertains to our processing activities for the data we own and control. If you are a California resident interacting with our site as a subscriber to one of our customers' businesses, please contact them directly to understand their practices under the CCPA.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This California Privacy Notice does not cover personal information collected from employees or job applicants in their capacity as employees or job applicants. It also does not apply to personal information collected from employees, owners, directors, officers, or contractors of businesses during the provision or receipt of business-related services. Consequently, any CCPA-related responses may exclude these categories of personal information.</p><p>Information Collected About Consumers in the Last 12 Months</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The categories of personal information we collect about you (as described below) originate from the following sources:</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Information provided by you, including through the use of our services and products.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Automatically collected information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Information obtained from third parties, such as when you authorize social networks to share your information with us or when you publicly make your personal information available online.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The chart below details the CCPA categories of personal information we have collected from consumers within the preceding twelve (12) months.</p><p>Purposes for Collecting Personal Information</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We collect personal information for one or more of the following business purposes:</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Providing our services (e.g., account servicing, customer service, advertising and marketing, analytics, and communication about our services).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Fulfilling operational purposes for us, our service providers, and integration partners.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Improving our existing products and services and developing new ones (e.g., conducting research to create new features or products).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Detecting, protecting against, and prosecuting security incidents and fraudulent or illegal activities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Bug detection, error reporting, and maintaining service quality or safety.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Auditing consumer interactions on our site (e.g., measuring ad impressions).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Short-term, transient use, such as customizing displayed content by us or our service providers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Other uses that advance our commercial or economic interests, including third-party advertising and relevant offers communication.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Responding to law enforcement requests, complying with applicable laws, court orders, or governmental regulations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• Evaluating or conducting mergers, divestitures, restructurings, reorganizations, dissolutions, sales, or transfers of some or all of Utobo's business or assets.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">• As disclosed during the collection of personal information or as set forth in the CCPA.</p><p>Sale of Personal Information</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The CCPA defines a "sale" of personal information as the disclosure, sharing, or provision of a consumer's personal information by a business to another business or third party in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. However, Utobo does not monetize your personal information. Although we share certain device and interaction information to enhance your experience and engage in legitimate advertising and marketing activities, we do not "sell" your personal information as defined by the CCPA and its regulations. If you consider a website's use of third-party cookies or similar technologies for advertising or analytics purposes a "sale" under the CCPA, please consider that Utobo may be considered to have "sold" what the CCPA refers to as "identifiers" (e.g., IP addresses), "internet or other electronic network activity information" (e.g., information about browsing activity on Utobo websites), and "commercial information" (e.g., indication of a browser visiting Utobo-related webpages). For more information, including how to exercise your right to opt out or manage your cookie preferences, please consult our Privacy Policy.</p><p>Exercising Your California Privacy Rights</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Only you or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf can make a verifiable consumer request regarding your personal information. Agents must provide proof of authorization from the consumer to act on their behalf. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require creating an account with us. Any personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request will only be used to verify the requestor's identity or authority.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We verify requests by sending a confirmation email to the requestor and comparing the identifying information provided with the personal information we possess. If we cannot: (i) verify your identity or authority, and (ii) confirm that the personal information pertains to you, we cannot fulfill your request or provide personal information. If we are unable to verify a consumer's identity with sufficient certainty, we will explain the reasons for denying the request.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For further information on your legal rights under applicable law or to exercise any of those rights, please contact us at support@utobo.com.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">You may make a verifiable request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">California residents can exercise their California privacy rights by submitting their request to support@utobo.com.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><h1 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Privacy Notice for Utobo Users in California</strong></h1><p style="text-align:justify;">Last updated: 07.28.2023</p><p>Notification Regarding Your Right to Opt-Out of Personal Information Sale</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As a Utobo user in California, you possess the right to instruct us not to sell or share your personal information with third parties. This right is commonly referred to as the "opt-out" right concerning the sale or sharing of personal information.</p><p>Definition of the "Sale" of Personal Information</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act, the term "sale" encompasses activities such as selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a user's personal information to a third party in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p><p>Please note that many instances of personal information disclosure do not fall under the category of sales.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, if we disclose or make available personal information to service providers or other contractors who provide business services on our behalf, it does not constitute a sale. Similarly, if you direct us to intentionally disclose personal information to or intentionally interact with one or more third parties, it does not count as a sale. Additionally, the transfer of personal information as an asset during a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other transfer of business control is not considered a sale.</p><p>Understanding the "Sharing" of Personal Information</p><p style="text-align:justify;">"Sharing" refers to the act of sharing, disclosing, making available, or otherwise communicating orally or in writing a user's personal information for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, commonly known as targeted advertising.</p><p>Consequences of Opting Out of Personal Information Sale/Sharing</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Should you choose to exercise your right to opt-out of the sale/sharing of personal information, we will promptly cease selling and/or sharing your personal information with third parties, ensuring compliance within a reasonable timeframe, not exceeding 15 days from the receipt of your request. Furthermore, we will notify all third parties to whom we have previously sold or shared your personal information about your opt-out request and instruct them to comply with the requirements set forth by our privacy policy.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For additional details regarding our privacy practices, please refer to our Privacy Policy https://utobo.com/privacy-policy.</p><p>Procedure for Submitting an Opt-Out Request for Personal Information Sale/Sharing</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To initiate an opt-out request for the sale/sharing of your personal information, kindly email us at support@utobo.com. The information you provide will facilitate the processing of your request. Please note that failure to provide the requested information may hinder our ability to identify you and fulfill your opt-out request. Rest assured that any information you provide will be used solely for processing your opt-out request and will not be utilized, disclosed, or retained for any other purpose.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">[If you do not have an Utobo account or are not currently logged in, your opt-out request for the sale/sharing of personal information will be linked solely to your browser identifier, as we do not possess information regarding the connection between your browser and your account.]</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="blog-1" class="py-100 blog-section division bg--white-300"><div class="container"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-10 col-lg-9"><div class="section-title mb-70"><h2 class="s-50 w-700">Keep Reading...</h2><p class="s-21 color--grey">Stay ahead, one read at a time.</p></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div id="bp-1-1" class="blog-post wow fadeInUp"><div class="blog-post-img mb-35"><img class="img-fluid r-16" src="https://images.utobo.com/get_in_touch_c2489512a4.jpg"></div><div class="blog-post-txt"><span class="post-tag" style="color:#fe6767">CONTACT US</span><h6 class="s-20 w-700"><a href="/blogs/contact-us">Get in touch with us</a></h6><div><p>Feel free to contact utobo.
