We may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off our Sites, such as after you have visited a partner\u2019s site or application.</li><li>Analytics: We use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including when you access our Sites from other websites, applications, or devices such as your mobile device.</li><li>Geo-Location Information: Some devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Some photos or other contact you place within our Service may contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. Also, some of the information we collect from a device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a device\u2019s location.</li><li>Flash Cookies: We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface that is different from the one provided by your web browser. This means that it is not possible to manage Flash cookies at the browser level in the same way you would manage other types of cookies. Instead, you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe\u2019s website directly.</li></ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"eb3c3b1\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>What other technologies so we use?</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div data-id=\"0fae3aa\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n \t<li>Log Files: Like most websites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer our sites, track user\u2019s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The log file information consists of IP addresses, browser type, browser language, referring URL, platform type, etc., and is not linked to identifiable personal information.</li>\n \t<li>Clear Gifs: Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we may use them to track the online movements of our users. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</li>\n \t<li>Profile: We may store information that we collect to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information may be tied to users\u2019 personally identifiable information to improve the content of the Site for users, improve our Services and provide new services that are likely to be of interest to users and to direct pertinent product updates and marketing promotions to users if they have opted in to receive those promotions. We do not share personally identifiable elements of a user\u2019s profile with other third parties. User profiles are shared in aggregate form only.</li>\n \t<li>Do Not Track Response: Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a \u201cdo not track\u201d option that sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different from blocking cookies as browsers with the \u201cdo not track\u201d option selected may still accept cookies. Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals, although one may be adopted in the future. We do not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will modify this Privacy Policy accordingly.

Some of our business partners (for example, third-party advertisers) may use cookies on the Site, in emails or in our advertisements on other websites to allow them to deliver the services they are providing. In order to create a user-friendly experience, some of our third-party promotions and advertisements are designed to automatically transmit users' information onto the third party's landing page when you choose to \"click\" upon a third party's advertisement or promotion.  We do not control these third parties or their use of cookies. As such, this Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party advertisers. Please check the websites of those third parties for details on how they use cookies.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHow long do cookies stay on your computer?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTwo types of cookies may be used on the Site, session cookies and persistent cookies.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSession cookies are temporary cookies that remain in your browser or device until you leave the site; they are deleted from your device once you leave the Service.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPersistent cookies are small files stored on your hard drive until you delete them or until they reach their expiry date. These may, for example, be used to remember your preferences when you use the Site, recognize you on your return, and enhance your experience on the Site (see more about profiles below). Use of a persistent cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Site except if you choose to store your user names and PINs so that you do not have to enter them each time you access your accounts. Then, a persistent cookie will be stored on your computer, which is linked to your account information. If you reject the persistent cookie, you may still use the Site but you will be limited in some areas of it. \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWe may use cookies for the following purposes (either on our own or by using third party services):\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAuthentication and Preferences: Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit our Sites, remember your preferences (such as languages and communication preferences), and customize your experience with using our Sites and Services.Security: Cookies may enable and support our security features and to help us detect malicious activity.Advertising: Cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off our Sites. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action on the advertiser\u2019s site. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we\u2019ve shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads. We may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off our Sites, such as after you have visited a partner\u2019s site or application.Analytics: We use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including when you access our Sites from other websites, applications, or devices such as your mobile device.Geo-Location Information: Some devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Some photos or other contact you place within our Service may contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. Also, some of the information we collect from a device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a device\u2019s location.Flash Cookies: We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface that is different from the one provided by your web browser. This means that it is not possible to manage Flash cookies at the browser level in the same way you would manage other types of cookies. Instead, you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe\u2019s website directly.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat other technologies so we use?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \tLog Files: Like most websites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer our sites, track user\u2019s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The log file information consists of IP addresses, browser type, browser language, referring URL, platform type, etc., and is not linked to identifiable personal information.\n \tClear Gifs: Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we may use them to track the online movements of our users. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\n \tProfile: We may store information that we collect to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information may be tied to users\u2019 personally identifiable information to improve the content of the Site for users, improve our Services and provide new services that are likely to be of interest to users and to direct pertinent product updates and marketing promotions to users if they have opted in to receive those promotions. We do not share personally identifiable elements of a user\u2019s profile with other third parties. User profiles are shared in aggregate form only.\n \tDo Not Track Response: Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a \u201cdo not track\u201d option that sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different from blocking cookies as browsers with the \u201cdo not track\u201d option selected may still accept cookies. Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals, although one may be adopted in the future. We do not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will modify this Privacy Policy accordingly. More information about \u201cdo not track\u201d is available at www.allaboutdnt.org.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCan I Change My Cookie Preferences?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBrowser settings allow you to choose whether or not to accept cookies or limit certain cookies. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies. If you use our Sites without changing your browser settings, we will assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on our Sites. Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Site may operate as intended.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tYour mobile operating system may let you opt out from having your information collected or used for interest-based advertising on mobile devices. You should refer to the instructions provided by your mobile device\u2019s manufacturer, but this functionality is usually available in the \u201cSettings\u201d section of your device.
