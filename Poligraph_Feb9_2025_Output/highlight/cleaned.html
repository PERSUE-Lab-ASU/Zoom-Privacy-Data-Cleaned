	<h4><strong>Your Privacy Rights</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
Thinktiv, Inc. and its Highlight partners (collectively, “Thinktiv” or “we” or “us”) has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you in conjunction with GetHighlight.com and the Highlight services (collectively, “Highlight”). This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 15, 2021. Any questions regarding this policy should be directed by email to Thinktiv.com. You may also contact Thinktiv at 1011 San Jacinto Blvd. #202, Austin, Texas 78701. The following discloses Thinktiv’s information gathering and dissemination practices for Highlight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected and Received</strong><br>
Thinktiv may collect or receive information about each person who registers with Highlight including, but not limited to, user-name, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, and interests. Thinktiv also collects information on the pages you access, the materials that are processed by the service, and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information. Thinktiv may also collect user location information, as further described in the “Global Positioning System” paragraph below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uses of Information</strong><br>
WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, TO ANY THIRD PARTY WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION. EVER.</p>
<p>Except as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared.</p>
<p>We use your personal information to provide the services, which includes the storage of recordings in our service provider.<br>
From time to time, we may partner with companies based on the interests of our users. These partner companies will never see your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly.</p>
<p>Any exceptions to this policy of sharing your name, address or email address with a partner company will be done only with your permission.</p>
<p>Thinktiv reserves the right to disclose information when required by law.</p>
<p>We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.</p>
<p>Thinktiv may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with Highlight’s server and to administer Highlight’s web site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
<p>The Highlight site registration form requires users to give Thinktiv contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). Thinktiv uses your contact information from the registration form to send you information about Highlight and promotional material from some of Thinktiv’s partners. Your contact information may also be used to contact you when necessary. Thinktiv may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the your experience on the Highlight website and/or applications, show you content that Thinktiv thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with third parties ONLY on an aggregate basis. Furthermore, Thinktiv shall have the right to retain records of all data pertaining to use of the website and applications including, but not limited to, usage, activity logs, and click-throughs. Thinktiv may disclose such data to third parties provided it is grouped with other Highlight users’ data and is presented in an aggregate form.</p>
<p>We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, statements made by our users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong><br>
We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone who we know to be under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 18, you should use this website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any personal information to us. If we discover that a person under the age of 13 has provided us with any personal information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such person's personal information from all Thinktiv systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking technology may need to be enabled in Thinktiv products and services in order to determine the location (latitude and longitude) of users of the Thinktiv products and services. This information is transmitted to Thinktiv, Thinktiv’s users, and temporarily stored by Thinktiv. Thinktiv does not provide this information to any other third party. This information is used in conjunction with Thinktiv’s applications.</p>
