(“P8”, “we”, “us” or “our”). It is our policy to respect your privacy and comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding any personally identifiable information (“PII”) we may collect about you, including across our website,&nbsp;<a href="https://produce8.com/" rel="">https://www.produce8.com</a>&nbsp;and other sites we own and operate.</p><p>PII is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This may include information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use a website or online service.</p><p>In the event the Site contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use PII. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our site.</p><p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.produce8.com/terms-of-service/" rel="">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;and forms part of the legally binding agreement between you and P8. Unless expressly defined in this Privacy Policy, defined terms have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.</p><p>We reserve the right to review and amend this Privacy Policy in our sole discretion. Any amendment of this Privacy Policy will take effect immediately upon the date of publication.<br></p><p><em>This Privacy Policy was last amended and published on August 25, 2022.</em></p><p></p><h3>Information We Collect</h3><p>Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected” information.</p><p>“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when accessing and using the Services.</p><p>“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your devices when accessing and using the Services.</p><p></p><h3>Log Data</h3><p>When you visit the Site, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser, which may include your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details about your visit.</p><p>Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the Site, we may automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.</p><p>Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.</p><p></p><h3>Device Data</h3><p>When you visit the Site or access and use the Services, we may automatically collect data about your device, such as:</p><ul><li>device type</li><li>operating system</li><li>geo-location data</li></ul><p>Data we collect can depend on the individual settings of your device and software. We recommend checking the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn what information they make available to us.</p><p></p><h3>Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</h3><p>We may ask for PII — for example, when you subscribe to our newsletter or when you contact us — which may include one or more of the following:</p><ul><li>name</li><li>email or physical address</li><li>phone/mobile number</li><li>transaction data</li></ul><p>Transaction data refers to data that accumulates over the normal course of operation of the Services. This may include transaction records, stored files, user profiles, analytics data and other metrics, as well as other types of information, created or generated, as users interact with our services.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Legitimate Reasons for Processing Your PII</strong></h3><p>We only collect and use your PII when we have a legitimate reason for doing so, and we only collect PII that is reasonably necessary to provide the Services to you.</p><p></p><h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3><p>We may collect PII from you when you do any of the following on our website:</p><ul><li>register for an account,</li><li>purchase a subscription,</li><li>sign up to receive updates from us via email or social media channels,</li><li>use a mobile device or web browser to access the Services,</li><li>contact us via email, social media, or on any similar technologies,</li><li>when you mention us on social media.</li></ul><p>We may collect, hold, use, and disclose information for the following purposes, and PII will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:</p><ul><li>to provide you with the Service’s core features and services,</li><li>to deliver the Services to you,</li><li>to contact and communicate with you,</li><li>for analytics, market research, and business development, including to operate and improve the Site and the Services,</li><li>to enable you to access and use the Site and the Services.</li></ul><p>We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected PII with general information or research data we receive from other trusted sources. For example, if you provide us with your location, we may combine this with general information about currency and language to provide you with an enhanced experience of the Site and the Services.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Security of Your PII</strong></h3><p>When we collect and process PII, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p><p>Although we will do our best to protect the PII you provide to us, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure or provides absolute data security.</p><p>You are responsible for selecting your password and its overall security strength, ensuring any passwords associated with accessing your PII and accounts are secure and confidential and thus ensuring the security of your own information within the context of the Services.</p><p></p><h3><strong>How Long We Keep Your PII</strong></h3><p>We keep your PII only for as long as we need to. This time period will vary depending upon what we are using your PII for in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, if you have provided us with PII as part of creating an account with us, we may retain this information for the duration your account exists on our system. If your PII information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or anonymize or de-identify it by removing all details that identify you. P8 uses industry standard techniques and procedures to remove or modify PII so it is no longer personally identifiable to you. However, if necessary, we may retain your information for compliance with legal, accounting, or reporting obligations, for archiving purposes in the public interest or for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.</p><p></p><h3>Children’s Privacy</h3><p>We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect PII about children under 13. The minimum age for accessing and using the Services is 19.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Disclosure of PII to Third Parties</strong></h3><p>We may disclose PII to:</p><ul><li>a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of P8,</li><li>third-party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to provide their services, including (without limitation) IT service providers, data storage, hosting and server providers, analytics, error loggers, debt collectors, maintenance or problem-solving providers, marketing providers, professional advisors, and payment systems operators,</li><li>our employees, contractors, and related entities,</li><li>our existing or potential agents or business partners,</li><li>credit reporting agencies and courts, tribunals, and regulatory authorities, in the event you fail to pay for the Services you have accessed and used,</li><li>courts, tribunals, regulatory authorities, and law enforcement officers, as required by law, in connection with any actual or prospective legal proceedings, or to establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights,</li><li>third-party service providers, including agents or sub-contractors, who assist us in providing information, products, services, or direct marketing to you,</li><li>third-party service providers to collect and process data,</li><li>and an entity that purchases our company or to which we transfer all or substantially of the company’s assets and business.</li></ul><p>Third-party service providers we currently use include:</p><ul><li>Google Analytics</li><li>LogRocket</li><li>HubSpot</li><li>Amazon Web Services</li></ul><p>P8’s third-party service providers use industry standard techniques and procedures to anonymize and de-identify PII.<br></p><h3><strong>International Transfers of PII</strong></h3><p>The PII we collect is stored and/or processed in the United States and Canada or in other countries where our third party service providers maintain facilities.</p><p>The countries in which we store, process, or transfer your PII may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. If we transfer your PII to third party service providers in other countries: (i) we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of applicable law; and (ii) we will protect the transferred PII in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><h3><strong>Your Rights and Controlling Your PII</strong></h3><p>Your choice: By providing PII to us, you understand we will collect, hold, use, and disclose your PII in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You do not have to provide PII to us, however, if you do not, it may affect your use of the Site and the Services you may access and use.</p><p>Information from third parties: If we receive PII about you from a third party, we will protect it as set out in this Privacy Policy. If you are a third party providing PII about somebody else, you represent and warrant that you have that person’s consent to provide their PII to us.</p><p>Marketing permission: If you have agreed to us using your PII for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by contacting us at the e-mail address at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Access: You may request details of the PII that we hold about you.</p><p>Correction: If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, please contact us at the e-mail address at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. We will take commercially reasonable steps to correct any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or out of date.</p><p>Non-discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights over your PII pursuant to this Privacy Policy. Unless your PII is required to provide you with the services you have requested or require (for example processing transaction data), we will not deny you access to the Services or charge you different prices or rates, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties, or provide you with a different level of services, merely because you have exercised your rights over your PII pursuant to this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Notification of data breaches: We will comply with applicable laws in respect of any data breach.</p><p>Complaints: If you believe that we have breached a relevant data protection law and wish to make a complaint, please contact us at the e-mail address at the bottom of this Privacy Policy and provide us with full details of the alleged breach.
