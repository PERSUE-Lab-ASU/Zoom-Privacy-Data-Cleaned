More broadly, upholding data rights is both a business imperative and a legal necessity, and the failure to do so can result in major consequences.</span></p>\n<p><span>JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries expect their clients to uphold their responsibilities as data controllers. The below terms appear in JobDiva, Inc.'s Terms of Service, which is part of JobDiva, Inc.'s service agreement with its clients. Failure by clients to conform could result in the termination of JobDiva, Inc.'s service.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Which Data for Data Subjects (You) Do JobDiva, Inc. Clients Manage and Control?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>As described above, data subjects are those individuals whose data passes through JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries: JobDiva, Inc. clients' staff; applicants; candidates; hired employees; and customers of clients, their suppliers, partners and staff, and other third parties' staff with whom the JobDiva client interact in conducting their business. When controllers uphold the below principles, data security for JobDiva, Inc. data subjects is protected. Data subject types are detailed below.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>JobDiva, Inc. Clients' Staff</strong>: JobDiva, Inc.'s clients' staff members will use JobDiva to make recruiting decisions and analyses. These rights apply to them, because their data is controlled in clients' specific JobDiva databases.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Applicants</strong>: When individuals apply to a job using a client's career portal, they become data subjects for the specific clients to whose portals they've applied. These rights apply to them.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Candidates</strong>: Candidates are data subjects whose resumes, CVs, on-boarding documents, payroll data or any other qualifying information have been obtained, stored and controlled by JobDiva clients in the clients' own databases. These rights apply to them.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Hired Employees</strong>: When individuals are hired by JobDiva, Inc.'s clients as employees, they become data subjects for those clients. Typically, these individuals are candidates and/or applicants first. Subsequently, JobDiva, Inc. clients can process payroll and benefit information about them by leveraging resources within JobDiva, Inc. These rights apply to them.</span></li>\n<li><a id=\"yourdatayourchoice2\" data-hs-anchor=\"true\"></a><span><strong>Customers of Clients, Their Suppliers, Their Partners</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and Their Staff and Other Third Parties' Staffing with Whom JobDiva, Inc.

JobDiva, Inc.'s Candidate Portal websites let applicants and candidates access and edit certain information, such as contact information and availability, which JobDiva, Inc. clients will then retain. Secondly, JobDiva, Inc. clients can email or print, scan and mail or email data subjects information that is stored in their own client JobDiva, Inc. database\u2014again, so long as the data does not contain the client's proprietary information or private data about other data subjects. JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide their clients the technological means for adhering to this Privacy Policy.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Choice and Correction of Data:&nbsp;</strong>If data subjects would like to update the information held about them by JobDiva, Inc. clients, and these updates would not impact the privacy of other data subjects, then such clients should make these changes within thirty days. JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide their clients the tools to execute such changes upon request by data subjects.

Third-party processing of personal data should be limited to relevant business purposes. If a third party will not follow or stops following the privacy terms set out by the JobDiva, Inc. client, and by JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries, a JobDiva client should attempt to prevent all further control or processing of data subjects' data by the third party. Continued utilization of a violating third party by a JobDiva, Inc. client could because for termination of JobDiva, Inc.'s services.</span></p>\n<p><span>Whenever JobDiva, Inc. clients decide to process data with a third party, they become responsible for monitoring and enforcing JobDiva, Inc.'s privacy policy with respect to the third party.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Recourse Mechanisms for Controllers</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>JobDiva, Inc. clients must have recourse mechanisms.
