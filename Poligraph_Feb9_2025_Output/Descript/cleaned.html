Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a third-party platform (such as Google), we will have access to certain information from that platform, such as your name, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that platform.</p><p><em>Information We Derive</em></p><p>We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your location based on your IP address.</p><h2 id="use-of-information">Use of Information</h2><p>We may use information we collect from you for various purposes, including to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Provide, maintain, analyze, test, and improve the Descript Service and our technology;</li><li>Generate voiceprints, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions, and use those voiceprints to authenticate you and prevent fraud as described <a href="#below">below</a>;</li><li>Process transactions and send you related information, including confirmations and invoices;</li><li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;</li><li>Respond to your comments, questions, and requests and provide customer service;</li><li>Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards, and events offered by us and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you (see the <a href="#your-choices">Your Choices</a> section below for information about how to opt-out of these communications at any time);</li><li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, performance, and activities in connection with the Descript Service;</li><li>Target advertisements to you on third-party properties as described <a href="#below">below</a>;</li><li>Detect, investigate and prevent security incidents, fraudulent transactions, and other illegal activities and protect the rights and property of us and others;</li><li>Personalize and improve the Descript Service and for research and development purposes including training our artificial intelligence models;</li><li>Comply with our legal and financial obligations;</li><li>Create de-identified, anonymized, or aggregated information that we will not attempt to re-identify; and</li><li>Carry out the purposes for which the information was specifically collected or for which you provided consent.</li></ul><p><em>Note with Respect to the Use of Project Information:</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, we protect the information contained in the Projects you create using the Descript Service (the “Projects’) as confidential information, and limit our use thereof, in accordance with the confidentiality obligations set forth in our Terms of Service.

We will retain those voiceprints until the purpose of collection has been satisfied or for up to three years after you last accessed your account, whichever occurs first. The Descript software that generates voiceprints runs on web hosting infrastructure provided by one of our vendors. Descript does not otherwise disclose voiceprints to third parties.</p><p><em>Note with Respect to Google API Services:</em> We use YouTube's API Services in connection with the Descript Service to provide certain features.
