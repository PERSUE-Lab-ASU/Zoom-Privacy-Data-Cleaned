(\u201cKUDO\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we may receive from users of our website, mobile application and video conferencing and communication services (the \u201cServices\u201d). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, users include anyone who accesses the Services (\u201cUser\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d). This Privacy Policy addresses personal data concerning Users that we process for purposes of operating our website, for improvement of our Services, and for marketing purposes. For notice and disclosures about personal data that we process under the accounts of our business customers (\u201cCustomers\u201d) in connection with online meetings, please refer to the privacy policy of the Customer whose account is being used for the meeting. As applicable, this Privacy Policy, along with our Terms of Service, describes the information we collect from Users, how we may use it and with whom we may share that information, the safeguards we use to protect such information and the choices you may make with respect to your personal data. Defined terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning as in our Terms of Service.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> This Privacy Policy explains KUDO\u2019s practices when we process your \u201cpersonal data,\u201d which is information that relates to an identified or reasonably identifiable individual. To \u201cprocess\u201d or \u201cprocessing\u201d means any use of personal data including, transferring, collecting, recording, storing, using, analyzing, combining, disclosing or deleting it.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> KUDO acknowledges the privacy of natural persons and makes efforts to protect them against any unlawful processing of their personal data. KUDO applies the relevant technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data of natural persons in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> This Privacy Policy applies to the personal data we process as a data controller (as defined in the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d)), that is, as the party that determines the means and purposes for processing personal data. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with the Services. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with KUDO and the choices you make, including the products and features you use.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> When you provide your personal data to KUDO through KUDO\u2019s website (<a href=\"https://kudo.ai/\">www.kudo.ai</a>), KUDO is considered a data controller of that information. In addition, when permitted by our Customer, KUDO processes personal data generated in connection with the Services, for the purposes of (a) analyzing meeting content to improve our language interpretation Services and (b) aggregating and de-identifying usage data and then using the resulting datasets for analytical and product improvement purposes. We process personal data as set forth in the preceding sentence based on our legitimate interests in improving and safeguarding our Services. All requests with respect to such information should be directed to KUDO using the contact information provided below.</p>\n<p>Except as set forth in the preceding paragraph, when you provide your personal data in connection with using our video conferencing and communication services (for example, when you provide personal data in the course of a meeting interpreted by KUDO-provided interpreters and/or hosted on KUDO\u2019s Core Platform), KUDO is not the controller of that data. Rather, KUDO is acting in its capacity as a data processor, as that term is defined under the GDPR. The controller of that personal data is the KUDO Customer through whose account the video conferencing and communication services are being provided. Where the Customer is the controller, , you must direct your questions and privacy requests concerning your personal data to the Customer, and not to KUDO. The Customer will then contact KUDO if necessary.</p>\n</div><div><h3>II. What Personal Data We Collect</h3>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> We will only process your personal data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. In some cases, we process personal data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such personal data (until/unless you withdraw your consent, which you may do by contacting us as set forth below). If you do not provide your consent, we will not proceed to process the data as requested in connection with the request for your consent.</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> KUDO also collects personal data from user registrations, requests for information, surveys, mailing lists subscriptions, contact forms, emails and other means of communications. We process this personal data based on our legitimate interests in providing, improving, and promoting our Services, and in some cases based on contractual necessity or your consent.</p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> When you register for a KUDO account, we collect information such as your name, email, phone, User IDs, password, and profile picture. KUDO may collect any information contained in any correspondence between us. For example, if you contact us using a form on our site or by email, telephone, or otherwise, we may keep a record of that correspondence. When an interpreter registers on the KUDO Platform or KUDO Marketplace, we also collect the information that the interpreter decides to provide when registering, such as their work history, degrees and educational history, city and country where the interpreter is located, time zone, date of birth, gender, languages spoken, and hourly rates or other methods of compensation.
