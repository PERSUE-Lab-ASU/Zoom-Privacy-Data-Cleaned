<p>This Privacy&nbsp;<strong>Policy describes</strong>&nbsp;how Invested Pro LLC (“Invested Pro”, ”we,” “our” or “us”), collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our websites, services, and applications (collectively, the “Platform” or ”Services”). This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) does not apply to information our customers may process when using our Platform and/or Services.</p>



<p>We may collect and receive information about users of our Services (“users,” “clients”, “members”, “instructors”, “you,” or “your”) from various sources, including (i) information you provide through your user account on the Services (your “Account”) if you register for the Services; (ii) your use of the Services; and (iii) from third-party websites, services, and partners.</p>



<p>We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy in full to ensure you are fully informed. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or INVESTED PRO’s data collection, use, and disclosure practices, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@investedpro.com">support@investedPro.com</a>.</p>



<p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>



<p><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p>



<p><strong>Account Registration</strong>. When you register for an Account, we may ask for your contact information, including items such as name, company name, address, biographical information, date of birth, professional licenses, location, employment history, links to your social media accounts, email address, usernames, telephone number, and any other information you choose to share publicly on the Services; including anything you post to a public part of your profile or an online classroom or forum on the service. If you choose to use an email address as your public username, that is solely under your discretion. If you choose to refer a friend to our Services, we may also collect your friend’s email address so that we may send them a referral or promotional code to sign up for our Services. Payment Information. When you add your financial account information to your Account, that information is directed to our third-party payment processor (Stripe and PayPal). We do not store your financial account information on our systems; however, we have access to&nbsp;and may retain, subscriber information through our third-party payment processor.</p>



<p>You should be aware that any information you provide on our community and forums – including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information – may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please <strong>contact us</strong>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.</p>



<p>Once you registered and created an account, you may also have the option of adding additional information such as:</p>



<ul><li>Member Title</li><li>Avatar</li><li>Biography (About Me)</li><li>Website</li><li>Occupation</li><li>Signature</li><li>Social Network Account addresses</li><li>Location (Country)</li><li>Timezone</li><li>And other details to your profile information to be displayed in our community.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Communications</strong>. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.</p>



<p>The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.</p>



<p><strong>Information We Collect When You Use Our Platform/Services</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong>. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.

This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, landing page, and referring URL.

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or clear gifs to record your preferences. We may also automatically collect information about your use of features of our Services, about the functionality of our Services, frequency of visits, and other information related to your interactions with the Services. We may track your use across different websites and services. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the information referenced above in this paragraph may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.</p>



<p><strong>Usage of our Services</strong>. When you use our Services, we may collect information about your engagement with and utilization of our Services, such as processor and memory usage, storage capacity, navigation of our Services, and system-level metrics. We use this data to operate the Services, maintain and improve the performance and utilization of the Services, develop new features, protect the security and safety of our Services and our customers, and provide customer support.

<p></p>



<p>For compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service, or other legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency.</p>



<p>INVESTED PRO will only use the personal information you have chosen to provide us for the purpose for which you provided it. We will not use it for any other purpose without your consent. We do not even provide a list of our current (paid) members’ websites to our potential (pre-sale) members, with the exception being if the current clients permit us to highlight/showcase their site or specific information or branding.</p>



<p><strong>Zoom</strong></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.zoom.com" target="_blank">Zoom</a> is a third party application used by Instructors to host their live lessons. These lessons are posted on the Invested Pro course listing pages. By setting up and accessing the Zoom integration as an instructor or simply attending Zoom sessions as a member of Invested Pro, you are still accountable for your conduct and actions as an Invested Pro instructor or member. Any violation of our privacy policy or misuse of the Zoom integration as it related to Invested Pro may result in removal or suspension of your account. Unlawful use of Live lessons as it relates to both the Invested Pro terms of service and privacy policy, may also result possible legal action based on the infraction that occurred.</p>



<p><strong>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</strong></p>



<p>We may share the information we collect in various ways, including the following:</p>



<p>Vendors and Service Providers. We may share information with third-party vendors and service providers that provide services on our behalf, such as helping to provide our Services, for promotional and/or marketing purposes, and to provide you with information relevant to you such as product announcements, software updates, special offers, or other information.</p>



<p>Aggregate Information. Where legally permissible, we may use and share information about users with our partners in aggregated&nbsp;or de-identified forms that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>



<p>Third-Party Partners. We also share information about users with third-party partners in order to receive additional publicly available information about you.</p>



<p>Information We Share When You Sign Up Through a Referral. If you sign up for our Services through a referral, we may share information with your referrer to let them know that you used their referral to sign up for our Services.</p>



<p>Analytics. We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect non-identifying information. Google provides some additional privacy options regarding its Analytics cookies at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.</p>



<p>Business Transfers. Information may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to any potential acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any proposed merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.</p>



<p>There will be occasions where it will be necessary for INVESTED PRO to disclose your personal information to third parties. We may be required by law to disclose the information, or we may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties to provide the service you have requested, for example, if you purchase products online from us, INVESTED PRO will need to disclose your personal information to third parties in order to bill and deliver your products. However, the disclosure will only be made where it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which you disclose your personal information (For example, if you pay through PayPal for our services then PayPal will need to know your billing details). Otherwise than stated above, we do not disclose personal information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any organization or person outside INVESTED PRO unless you have authorized us to do so.</p>



<p>As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures. We may also share information to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; (iv) respond to your requests; or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.</p>



<p>With Your Consent, we may share your information.&nbsp;Under no circumstances will INVESTED PRO sell or receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information or your users’ information on the platform.</p>



<p><strong>LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>



<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>



<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these Services, for example when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.</p>



<p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need personal&nbsp;information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>



<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>



<p><strong>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</strong></p>



<p>You may access other third-party services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those third-party services from within the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.</p>



<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>



<p>INVESTED PRO is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a variety of security technologies and measures designed to protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.</p>



<p>INVESTED PRO operates secure data networks that are designed to protect your privacy and security. Our providers (such as PayPal &amp; Stripe) have their own Security and Privacy Issues document which can be found on their websites. We do not store any sensitive information such as Credit card numbers on our servers. Credit Card numbers are stored on our payment processor’s server which is&nbsp;PCI Compliant and has bank-grade&nbsp;encryption.</p>



<p>However, please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You are responsible for ensuring your website is secure and your passwords are protected at all times. Also, you are responsible to ensure that your password strength for your account is reasonably high and weaker passwords can be targeted by hackers which is&nbsp;not in our control.</p>



<p><strong>DATA RETENTION</strong></p>



<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).</p>



<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will delete it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>



<p><strong>ACCESS</strong></p>



<p>If you are a registered user, you may access certain information associated with your Account by logging into your my-account page or emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@investedpro.com">support@investedPro.com</a>.</p>



<p>To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your information. The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could: inhibit INVESTED PRO’s ability to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit INVESTED PRO’s ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to INVESTED PRO or a third party.</p>



<p><strong>YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)</strong></p>



<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:</p>

<p>Similarly, if we have collected and processed&nbsp;your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.

<p>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</p>



<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
