However, there are certain circumstances in which SugarCRM cannot act without processing certain personal data, for example to process your orders, or to assist you with use of our Services, or to provide access to a web offering or newsletter. In these cases, it will not be possible for SugarCRM to provide what you request without the relevant personal information. In some circumstances, SugarCRM may need to terminate your ability to use the Services without access to your personal data. SugarCRM intends to notify you of whether such communication or data sharing is deemed mandatory and the impact of not sharing.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4>Sharing of your personal data</h4>\n<p><span>SugarCRM is a global organisation with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. As such, we may share data about you with other SugarCRM entities and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified in this Privacy Policy. Our procedures are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information by all SugarCRM entities.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>In some cases we use suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyse, and otherwise process information on our behalf. We may also use third party service providers including digital marketing service providers that conduct marketing activity on our behalf. We may also use subcontractors that provide services to us in connection with providing our Services to you. We put in place contractual safeguards for the protection of your personal data with such suppliers, third party service providers and subcontractors including obligations for processing in line with applicable legal requirements to ensure compliant processing.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We may also disclose your personal information to other business partners. Unless otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy, we will only do so with your consent. We do not in any event sell or lease any of your personal information.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Where you post information to our wikis, forums, blogs, message boards, chat rooms, websites or other social networking environments, your information will be shared with audiences within those platforms.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We may share your personal data based on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person. We may use your personal data as evidence in litigation in which we are involved, to protect the rights or safety of any person or entity, to respond to a judicial process or valid government inquiry or as otherwise required by law.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We do not sell your personal information.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4>Where we process personal data</h4>\n<p><span>If you choose to provide us with information, including personal data, you understand that we are storing this and/or transferring it to SugarCRM\u2019s locations and systems in the United States or to the locations and systems of SugarCRM\u2019s affiliates or service providers around the world. SugarCRM complies with applicable law when transferring your personal information outside of the country there the information is collected.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including the Data Privacy Framework Program and contracts such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>SugarCRM complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
