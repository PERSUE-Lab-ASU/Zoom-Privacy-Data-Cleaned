    If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, please do so through this webpage: <a _ngcontent-c9="" href="http://www.qnap.com/sarf" target="_blank">www.qnap.com/sarf</a>.
  </p>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    After receiving your request, we will evaluate your request and inform you how we intend to proceed with your
    request. Under certain circumstances, in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations, we may withhold
    access to your data, or decline to modify, erase, port, or restrict the processing of your data.
  </p>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    Please be advised that if you exercise the rights to erase data, restrict or object to our processing, or to withdraw
    your consent, we may not be able to continue providing our services to you if the necessary data is missing for
    processing.
  </p>
  <h2 _ngcontent-c9="">Transfer, storage, and processing of data abroad</h2>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    As noted in the "Sharing your personal data" section of this Notice, as a globally operating company, we may share
    your information with our affiliate companies or third parties. Please refer to the "Sharing your personal data"
    section of this Notice for the recipients of your data and the reasons for our provision of your data to them. Where
    such entities are located in other countries and jurisdictions, we will therefore be transferring your personal data
    outside of the European Economic Area. In making such data transfers, we make sure to protect your personal data by
    applying the level of security required by applicable privacy laws. Where we transfer your data to a country or
    jurisdiction that cannot guarantee the required level of protection as required by applicable privacy laws, we have
    enhanced our IT security measures and have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with the transferee to
    require security obligations on the transferee, both of which are intended to increase the protection of your personal
    data. SCCs are one of a number of "appropriate safeguards" under the applicable privacy laws that enable the transfer
    of personal data concerning data subjects within the European Economic Area to jurisdictions that have not been
    designated by the European Commission as possessing an adequate level of data protection. You may request a copy of
    such SCCs from us, or inquire about transfers of your information, by providing your request to the contact window set
    forth in the "Whom should I contact?" section.
  </p>
  <h2 _ngcontent-c9="">Further processing</h2>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose not covered by this Notice, then we will provide you with a
    new notice explaining this new use prior to commencing such further processing for a new purpose. This new notice sets
    out the relevant new purpose and processing conditions. In such a case, we will find a lawful basis for further
    processing, and whenever necessary, we will seek your prior written consent to such further processing.
  </p>
  <h2 _ngcontent-c9="">Security</h2>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    We protect your data using technical measures to minimize the risks of misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized
    disclosure, loss or theft, and loss of access. Some of the safeguards we use are data pseudonymization, data
    encryption, firewalls, and data access authorization controls. We take our data security very seriously. Therefore the
    security mechanisms used to protect your data are checked and updated regularly to provide effective protection
    against abuse.
  </p>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    The servers through which we collect your information are usually encoded using the encryption module of your
    browser, and are certified by renowned institutions for international encryption technique. If necessary, we use
    Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect your personal information. Moreover, we have put in place additional
    and comprehensive state-of-the-art security measures every time your data are accessed through the internet. Firewalls
    prevent unauthorized access. Diverse encryption and identification layers protect your data from intrusion or
    disclosure to third parties during data transfer. Furthermore, we internally use sophisticated encoding methods in
    order to prevent decoding by unauthorized persons. Moreover, an electronic identifier is generated during data
    transfer to safeguard your information.
  </p>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    For your confidentiality and security, we use IDs and passwords to secure your personal information. It is important
    for you to protect your ID, password, or any personal information. Do not disclose your personal information,
    especially your password, to anyone. When you are finished using our services, please do not forget to log out from
    your account. If you share a computer, whether in a public or private setting, be sure to sign off and close your
    browsers when finished using a shared computer.
  </p>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    If you believe that the security of your data has been compromised, or if you would like more information on the
    measures we use to protect your data, you can contact us using the channels set forth in the "Whom should I contact?"
    section of this Notice.
  </p>
  <h2 _ngcontent-c9="">What are your choices?</h2>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    You have the choice to allow us to collect and process your data. The collection and processing of your personal data
    is neither a statutory nor a contractual requirement, although as noted above, we will be unable to provide you with
    certain services without the necessary data.
  </p>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    If you are dealing with us online, note that most browsers will inform you how to prevent your browser from accepting
    new cookies, how to receive notifications whenever you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies. Additionally,
    you can disable or delete the data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, on your browser or on the website
    of its manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p _ngcontent-c9="">
    You can always choose not to provide us with your data. In case we may need such data to process your requests, we
    will inform you of our constraints.

    In summary, what we are allowed to do with your data—with limited exceptions under applicable privacy laws—is up to
    you. However, in the event that you choose not to let us further process your data, your choice may affect the
    delivery of our obligations or services to you. In this case, we will inform you of our constraints.
