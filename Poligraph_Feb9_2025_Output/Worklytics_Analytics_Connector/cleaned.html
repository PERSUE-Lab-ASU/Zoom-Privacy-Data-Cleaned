How We Use Your Personal Information</strong></h3><p>Subject to your Rights and Choices below, we generally use your Personal Information in the following ways:</p><p><strong>A. To provide, maintain, and improve our Marketing Site, including analytics, marketing, support, and job applications</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>Contact Information: We use your Contact Information to contact you about our Services, provide demonstrations of the Application, provide support you request, and to help in our direct marketing efforts. Specifically, if you provide your email address for marketing purposes, we may use it to contact you with newsletters, marketing, or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.</li><li>Login Information: We use your Login Information to enable you to securely access the Application and to identify your activities in the Application.</li><li>Job Information: If you apply to work at Worklytics, we use your Job Information to evaluate your application and contact you about it.</li><li>Log and Device Information: We use Log and Device Information to help improve our Application and Services, internal operations, and systems. We also use Device Information to understand a user’s engagement in an activity or feature, for example which pages or tools you interacted with or data about any crashes during use.</li><li>Advertising: We, and certain third parties operating on or through our Marketing Site, may engage in online behavioral advertising. This form of advertising includes various parties and service providers, including third-party data controllers, engaged in the processing of cookies and other online identifiers, in connection with advertising. We may place cookies on your device, then provide it directly to a third party for targeted advertising on a third-party platform. The parties that control the processing of Personal Information for behavioral advertising purposes may build a profile of you containing this information, and may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time. See the “<strong>Rights and Choices</strong>” and “<strong>Cookies</strong>” sections below for information about how you can limit or opt out of this processing.</li></ol><p><strong>B. To provide, maintain, and improve our Application and Services</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>Workplace Information: We analyze work information&nbsp; in the Application at the direction of our Customers. In doing so, we process&nbsp; Work Information&nbsp; from workplace tools, for example Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, GitHub, Jira, GitLab, Bitbucket, and others. We analyze that Work Information on both an individual and company level, using it to improve Customer decision-making and employee experience, among other things. We do not intentionally process information about user gender, race, or other categories of sensitive information. To the extent we unintentionally receive such sensitive information, we do not store or process it. However, if a Customer elects to use a proxy to run our Application, the Customer may choose to provide us with Personal Information, including Work Information, or not. Proxies may run in a Customer’s system and not send any employee Personal Information to Worklytics. A Customer may choose to anonymize data in the proxy that would otherwise be considered Personal Information, then share that data with Worklytics. We may process some Personal Information of Customer Employees if the Customer chooses pseudonymization methods that leave some Personal Information intact when sharing with us for support or other business purposes. We reserve the right at all times to process, commercialize, and otherwise use anonymized data without restriction. For more information on how we enable pseudonymization and anonymization via proxy, see <a href="https://www.worklytics.co/how-it-works">here</a>.</li><li>User Content: Pursuant to Customer instructions, we analyze User Content to provide information to the Customer about employee activity. We do not moderate User Content, and in general only process the metadata associated with User Content. However, the Customer may sometimes view User Content.</li><li>Survey Information: At the direction of Customers, we process Survey Information, such as surveys on performance and employee engagement, and provide it to the Customer for its internal use. The Customer chooses the content of any survey.</li><li>Log and Device Information: We use Log and Device Information to secure and &nbsp;improve our Application and Services, internal operations, and systems. We also use Device Information to understand a user’s engagement in an activity or feature, for example which pages or tools you interacted with or data about any crashes during use.</li></ol><p><strong>C. To create anonymized data about use of our Services</strong></p><p>We use Personal Information to create anonymized analytics data about the use of our Services; we may use this data for any legally-permissible purpose, including without limitation benchmarking and other research &amp; development purposes. We may retain this data after you or the Customer no longer uses or has an account in the Services.</p><p><strong>D. To comply with legal obligations or pursuant to a transaction</strong></p><p>If Worklytics is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Information may be transferred. We will provide notice before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p><p>Under certain circumstances, Worklytics may be required to disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</p><p>Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p><ol role="list"><li>comply with a legal obligation;</li><li>protect and defend the rights or property of Worklytics;</li><li>prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service;</li><li>protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public; or</li><li>protect against legal liability.</li></ol><h3><strong>6. Information Sharing</strong></h3><p>We may share Personal Information we collect with a variety of parties, depending upon the purpose for and context in which you provided that information. We generally share Personal Information with the following types of recipients:</p><p><strong>A. Customers</strong></p><p>We share Personal Information provided in the Application with Customers for the improvement of their business. In general, we do not share work product generated on productivity tools with the Customer and we do not share Personal Information from one Customer with other Customers. We reserve the right, however, to share, sell, or otherwise commercialize aggregate, anonymized data gathered from the Application with Customers and third parties without restriction (such as statistical benchmarks and the like).</p><p><strong>B</strong>.<strong>Third-Party Service Providers</strong></p><p>The below third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use your information for any other purpose.</p></div><div class="w-layout-grid grid-2"><div id="w-node-_82762c6d-d6a4-f5d5-d0aa-cab31f620e27-f79135a5" class="providers__cell providers__cell--header">Provider</div><div id="w-node-da768f3f-20f9-8ade-7afd-625f13c6f237-f79135a5" class="providers__cell providers__cell--header">Function</div><div id="w-node-b95c1672-9d0e-9e81-e429-73f0a571eb98-f79135a5" class="providers__cell providers__cell--header">Privacy Notice</div><div id="w-node-_85c8be9e-40ed-b6dc-c36f-62be948ae1f6-f79135a5" class="providers__cell providers__cell--header">Geography</div><div id="w-node-be59555d-4554-3154-5e68-fe59dffdd580-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">AWS</div><div id="w-node-_17ad4865-b119-21ac-c46b-3f910ff93877-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">Hosting provider</div><div id="w-node-_503372a5-22ce-428d-0979-43ffc032e8cb-f79135a5" class="providers__cell"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/"><strong>Amazon Web Services Privacy Policy</strong></a></div><div id="w-node-_66529c83-55b3-2f30-c0c4-867b70f1fdd7-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">U.S.</div><div id="w-node-_628a54d1-06a0-2d2b-c418-645af9b596c6-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">Google Cloud</div><div id="w-node-_8bce38a3-a096-477c-6cc9-8804c9f9d2aa-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">Infrastructure provider</div><div id="w-node-_111c46ee-e0f0-a984-d008-9ac12a4d8a01-f79135a5" class="providers__cell"><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/"><strong>Google Cloud Privacy Policy</strong></a></div><div id="w-node-_4775fbbe-1bfe-c4eb-16f8-8f972a511b82-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">U.S.</div><div id="w-node-_23ad3cab-9701-0ed2-bdf6-d8fa3c7dc52a-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">Microsoft Azure</div><div id="w-node-_7667140d-a683-7880-7773-86fbc0090fa1-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">Cloud Services</div><div id="w-node-_2e5d69a5-9781-1b18-7b9e-69fd6e57c20e-f79135a5" class="providers__cell"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/privacy"><strong>Microsoft Privacy Policy</strong></a></div><div id="w-node-b9aa8f54-ea5b-5d57-e682-103472e50f31-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">U.S.</div><div id="w-node-f01b44c6-efe8-2b02-a5be-94e1aa325dc5-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">Zendesk</div><div id="w-node-_06b9270f-31ef-71ca-1a0f-af722906d943-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">User Support</div><div id="w-node-_8eb46be2-6e79-2c05-d941-f33c201c2a8f-f79135a5" class="providers__cell"><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/privacy-policy/"><strong>Zendesk Privacy Policy</strong></a></div><div id="w-node-ee7bc30b-fcd7-f8a1-b7cb-8e98109c3c83-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">U.S.</div><div id="w-node-db6d5b58-7838-4a91-29e8-deb0024f05a0-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">Sendgrid</div><div id="w-node-_226aa2a6-71c4-d7a6-4a5c-a2424c6d5f4e-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">Mail and marketing platform</div><div id="w-node-c9cab637-8131-fff4-a637-7a4a3a017d6d-f79135a5" class="providers__cell"><a href="https://sendgrid.com/policies/privacy/"><strong>SendGrid Privacy Policy</strong></a></div><div id="w-node-_76c9350e-4a37-0ebc-07e9-409effc71739-f79135a5" class="providers__cell">U.S.</div></div><div class="rich-text-wks w-richtext"><h3><strong>7.
