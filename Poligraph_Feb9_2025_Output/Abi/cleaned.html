However, not providing the information we request may restrict your ability to use certain features or functionality of the Websites. For example, Users cannot register for an account through the Portal if they do not provide us with their name and email address.</p><p class="mt-3 text-sm">We may seek prior consent for certain processing. Where processing is based on consent, consent may be withdrawn at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:ask@beroe-inc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="font-[400] underline text-[#551A8B] visited:text-purple-60">ask@beroe-inc.com</a>. Any withdrawal of consent is only effective on a going-forward basis, and will not impact processing we undertook while relying on a valid consent.</p><p class="mt-3 text-sm">Users that create an account may access and change their PII using the "Change" or "Edit" function by accessing their profile <a href="https://live.beroeinc.com/#/myProfile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="font-[400] underline text-[#551A8B] visited:text-purple-60"> https://live.beroeinc.com/#/myProfile</a>.

Not all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser “do not track” signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies.

You may exercise these rights, if applicable, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:ask@beroe-inc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="font-[400] underline text-[#551A8B] visited:text-purple-60">ask@beroe-inc.com</a>. We will retain your PII for as long as we reasonably need to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. For example, if you register for our Services and create an account, we will store your information for as long as needed to maintain your account, provide the services you request, enforce any applicable terms that govern your use of the services, and maintain appropriate records to reflect our delivery of services to you. Individuals located in the EU, or a place where EU member state law applies, also may have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU or member state supervisory authority.</p><h4 class="text-[22px] leading-[36px] text-gray-900 mt-[35px] font-extrabold">International Data Transfers</h4><p class="mt-3 text-sm">We may store and process information, including through third-party or affiliate hosting services, in the United States, European Economic Area, or any other international jurisdiction. As a result, we may transfer the PII described in this Privacy Policy for the purposes and to the parties described in this Privacy Policy to locations that may be outside of the jurisdiction where you are located. The laws in those jurisdictions may be different than the data protection laws in the jurisdiction in which you reside. Some of these jurisdictions may not have been deemed adequate by the European Commission to provide a comparable level of protection to that of the jurisdiction in which you are located. However, we will treat PII as subject to, and protect it in accordance with, this Privacy Policy. If we transfer PII from the EU to any other party located outside the EU, we will ask for your consent or rely on a legal framework that provides appropriate safeguards, which may include standard contractual clauses or some other framework deemed adequate by the European Commission.</p><h4 class="text-[22px] leading-[36px] text-gray-900 mt-[35px] font-extrabold">Privacy Policy Amendments</h4><p class="mt-3 text-sm">We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or delete portions of this Privacy Policy at any time without further notice.

By continuing to access and/or use the Websites or Services following the posting of a new Privacy Policy version, you agree to be bound by the then-current version.
