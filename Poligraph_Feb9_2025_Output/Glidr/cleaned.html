("LaunchPad Central") treats the information we collect when you visit and use the websites available at www.glidr.com and other related websites with links to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Website”). Please read this notice very carefully.</p><h3>1. WEBSITE VISITORS</h3><p>Like most website operators, LaunchPad Central collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. LaunchPad Central's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how LaunchPad Central's visitors use its Website. From time to time, LaunchPad Central may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website. LaunchPad Central also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. LaunchPad Central does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p><h3>2. GATHERING OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h3><p>Certain visitors to the Website choose to interact with LaunchPad Central in ways that require LaunchPad Central to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that LaunchPad Central gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for LaunchPad Central services to provide a username and email address. Clients who sign up for LaunchPad Central's services are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to create accounts and process payments. In each case, LaunchPad Central collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with LaunchPad Central. LaunchPad Central does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can refuse to supply certain personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website-related activities. LaunchPad Central does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided LaunchPad Central with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@glidr.ai" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">support@glidr.ai</a> If LaunchPad Central becomes aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information.</p><h3>3. AGGREGATED STATISTICS</h3><p>LaunchPad Central may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Website. For instance, LaunchPad Central may monitor the most popular blogs on the Website to help identify spam. LaunchPad Central may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, LaunchPad Central does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p><h3>4. DISCLOSURE AND PROTECTION OF CERTAIN PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h3><p>LaunchPad Central discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on LaunchPad Central's behalf or to provide services available at the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. LaunchPad Central's Website consists of a suite of services for use by Authorized Users. An individual company may create a LaunchPad Central account or it may be created by a sponsoring organization such as businesses, universities and government agencies. The creator of the account is defined as LaunchPad Central's "Client" pursuant to LaunchPad Central's Terms &amp; Conditions of use at http://www.glidr.io/fine-print. Clients have complete access to all information entered by users created under a Client account; Launch Pad Central has no obligation to maintain any information entered by a user as private or confidential as between the user and the Client. In addition, each Client may elect, in its sole discretion, to make all information entered by a user freely available to all other users existing under the Client account, or to restrict the availability of such information within the Client account in any manner it sees fit. For example, if the Client is a sponsoring organization it may sponsor user accounts for multiple startup teams , and in such case the Client may elect to make all information entered by any user available: (i) to each member of every startup team under the sponsoring organization's Client account, (ii) only to other members of the user's startup team, or (iii) to such other users under the Client account as Client sees fit. Potentially personally identifying and personally-identifying information may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization or other transfer (a "Transfer") involving LaunchPad Central. LaunchPad Central specifically reserves the right to transfer personal information to a third party in connection with a Transfer. Should such a Transfer occur, we will request that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information, as and to the extent required by applicable law and to require that you receive prior notice if your personal information could be used contrary to this Policy. Otherwise, LaunchPad Central will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as described above, LaunchPad Central discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when permitted to do so by law, or when LaunchPad Central believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of LaunchPad Central, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Website and have supplied your email address, LaunchPad Central may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with LaunchPad Central and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we may ask you for your personal information and other information necessary to answer your question or resolve your problem. LaunchPad Central takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally identifying and personally-identifying information. You should also be aware that if you submit information to "chat rooms," "forums" or "message boards" such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications. For users outside the United States, please note that any personally-identifiable information you enter into the Website will be transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to such transfer through your use of the Website. You also warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United States.</p><h3>5. DATA RETENTION POLICY</h3><p>Access Logs: Personal data is not stored in access logs. Logs reference user activities by unique IDs, and any sensitive data, such as IP addresses, is truncated to protect user privacy. All logs have a time-to-live (TTL) of 6 months, after which they are automatically deleted. User-Generated Content: Personal data and user-generated content are retained until the user actively chooses to delete it through the platform. This ensures that data is only kept for as long as necessary for its intended purpose. Personal Account and Profile Information: This information is stored until the user specifically requests its deletion. Upon receiving such a request, the data is permanently deleted from the platform.</p><h3>6. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</h3><p>This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected by LaunchPad Central. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that LaunchPad Central does not own or control, or employees that LaunchPad Central does not manage. The Website contains links to third party websites. Any information you provide to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if any. We encourage you to read such privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of your personally-identifying information, and LaunchPad Central and its affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your personally-identifying information by any third party.</p><h3>7. SECURITY</h3><p>All non-personally-identifying information, potentially personally-identifying and personally identifying information described above is stored on restricted database servers.</p><h3>8. CHOICE/OPT-OUT</h3><p>If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products, services or information that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by which you may request no further notices.</p><h3>9. COOKIES</h3><p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. LaunchPad Central uses cookies to help LaunchPad Central identify and track visitors, their usage of the Website, and their Website access preferences. LaunchPad Central visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Website, with the drawback that certain features of the Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p><h3>10. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</h3><p>LaunchPad Central may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in LaunchPad Central's sole discretion. If we do then we'll notify you by posting the amended policy on the Website or by emailing you of the nature of the modifications along with a link to the modified document so that you can review it. In all cases, use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p><h3>11. REVIEW AND ACCESS</h3><p>Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify or delete this information by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@glidr.ai" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">support@glidr.ai</a>. Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account.</p><h3>12.
