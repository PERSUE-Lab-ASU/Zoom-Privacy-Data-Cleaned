Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. LaunchPad Central's Website consists of a suite of services for use by Authorized Users. An individual company may create a LaunchPad Central account or it may be created by a sponsoring organization such as businesses, universities and government agencies. The creator of the account is defined as LaunchPad Central's \"Client\" pursuant to LaunchPad Central's Terms & Conditions of use at http://www.glidr.io/fine-print. Clients have complete access to all information entered by users created under a Client account; Launch Pad Central has no obligation to maintain any information entered by a user as private or confidential as between the user and the Client. In addition, each Client may elect, in its sole discretion, to make all information entered by a user freely available to all other users existing under the Client account, or to restrict the availability of such information within the Client account in any manner it sees fit. For example, if the Client is a sponsoring organization it may sponsor user accounts for multiple startup teams , and in such case the Client may elect to make all information entered by any user available: (i) to each member of every startup team under the sponsoring organization's Client account, (ii) only to other members of the user's startup team, or (iii) to such other users under the Client account as Client sees fit. Potentially personally identifying and personally-identifying information may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization or other transfer (a \"Transfer\") involving LaunchPad Central. LaunchPad Central specifically reserves the right to transfer personal information to a third party in connection with a Transfer. Should such a Transfer occur, we will request that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information, as and to the extent required by applicable law and to require that you receive prior notice if your personal information could be used contrary to this Policy. Otherwise, LaunchPad Central will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as described above, LaunchPad Central discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when permitted to do so by law, or when LaunchPad Central believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of LaunchPad Central, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Website and have supplied your email address, LaunchPad Central may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with LaunchPad Central and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we may ask you for your personal information and other information necessary to answer your question or resolve your problem. LaunchPad Central takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally identifying and personally-identifying information. You should also be aware that if you submit information to \"chat rooms,\" \"forums\" or \"message boards\" such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications. For users outside the United States, please note that any personally-identifiable information you enter into the Website will be transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to such transfer through your use of the Website. You also warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United States."}]}, {"role": "heading", "name": "5.
