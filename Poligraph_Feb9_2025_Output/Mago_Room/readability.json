We may also receive information from other affiliated companies that are a part of our corporate group. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new prospects for marketing, and provide products and other services that may be of interest to you.{' '} </p><h4>Location Information:</h4><p> We collect your location-based information for the purpose of providing and supporting our Services and for fraud prevention and security monitoring.

This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. </li><li> Request erasure of your personal data.

Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. </li><li> Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. </li><li> Request restriction of processing of your personal data.

This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. </p><h4>Time limit to respond</h4><p> We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.

In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time. </p><p> If you wish to cancel your account; no longer require the use of our Services; or if we hold personal information about you and you want it to be removed from our database or inactivated, please use the relevant \u201cDelete account\u201d sections within the Services or contact us at the DPO Email address.{' '} </p></li><li><h3> Analytics, Cookies and Other Web Site Technologies </h3><p> We are continuously improving our websites and Services through the use of various third-party web analytics tools, which help us understand how visitors use our websites, desktop tools, and mobile applications, what they like and dislike, and where they may have problems.
