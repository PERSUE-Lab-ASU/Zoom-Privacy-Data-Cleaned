            </ul>

            <p>Specifically, this Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding:</p>

            <p>If you are a Customer, User or Prospect, please read this Privacy Policy carefully and make sure that you fully understand it.</p>

            <p>
                Our Services are designed for businesses and are not intended for personal or household use. Accordingly, we treat all personal data covered by this Privacy Policy, including information about any visitors to our Sites, as pertaining to individuals acting as business representatives,
                rather than in their personal capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are not legally required to provide us with any personal data. If you do not wish to provide us with your personal data, or to have it processed by us or any of our Service Providers (as defined below), please do not provide it to us and avoid any interaction with us or with our
                Sites, or use our Services.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Data Collection &amp; Processing</li>

                <p>
                    When we use the terms “personal data” or “personal information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual. It does not
                    include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sometimes we collect personal data automatically when an individual interacts with our Services and sometimes we collect personal data directly from an individual. At times, we may collect personal data about an individual from other sources and third parties (such as our
                    Customers and Service Providers), even before our first direct interaction.
                </p>

                <p>We may collect or generate the following types of personal data about individuals through the Services:</p>

                <p>
                    Usage, login credentials, and device information concerning Users and Prospects (connectivity, technical and aggregated usage data, such as user agent, IP addresses and approximate location based upon such IP addresses, device data (like type, OS, device id, browser version,
                    locale and language settings used), activity logs, session recordings, log-in credentials to the Services, the cookies and pixels installed or utilized on their device, and inferred or presumed data generated from their use of the Services);
                </p>
                <p>
                    Information concerning our Customers, Users and Prospects contact and business details such as name, email, phone number, position, workplace and related business insights, our communications with such individuals (correspondences, sensory information including call and video
                    recordings, and transcriptions and analyses thereof), feedback and testimonials received, contractual and billing details, as well as any expressed, presumed or identified needs, preferences, attributes and insights relevant to our potential or existing engagement);
                </p>

                <p>
                    Personal data contained in Customer Data which is provided by our Customers or processed on their behalf and under their instruction. This may include any of the types of personal data described above (with respect to Users or other individuals whose data is contained in the
                    Customer Data), in accordance with our
                    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
<a href="https://fourfour.ai/dpa" class="not-prose cursor-pointer text-ff-brand-orange">Data Processing Addendum</a>
                    with them.
                </p>

                <li>Data Uses</li>

                <p>
                    We use personal data as necessary for the performance of our Services (“Performance of Contract”); to comply with our legal and contractual obligations (“Legal Obligation”); and to support our legitimate interests in maintaining and improving our Services, e.g., in understanding
                    how our Services are used and how our campaigns are performing, and gaining insights which help us dedicate our resources and efforts more efficiently; in marketing, advertising and selling our Services; providing customer service and technical support; and protecting and
                    securing our Customers, Users, Prospects, ourselves and our Services (“Legitimate Interests”).
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you reside or are using the Services within the UK, the legal basis for the processing of your personal data will be in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). This includes obtaining your consent where required and processing personal data where
                    it is necessary for the performance of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation, or for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by us, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We define a "Restricted Use Data Category" that includes personal data obtained from Google Workspace APIs, Microsoft Graph and similar customer integration APIs where the providers of these services impose strict limitations on the usage of their data. This category is governed
                    by rigorous compliance measures to adhere to the specified conditions from these entities.
                </p>

                <p>Data categorized under the "Restricted Use Data Category" is utilized solely for providing and enhancing user-facing services, in alignment with our contractual commitments to the data providers.</p>

                <p>Specifically, the data is not used for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Targeted, personalized, interest-based, or retargeted advertisements.</li>
                    <li>Selling to data brokers or providing to information resellers.</li>
                    <li>Creating databases for non-user-facing features.</li>
                    <li>Developing, improving, or training generalized/non-personalized Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine Learning models.</li>
                    <li>Transferring to third-party Artificial Intelligence tool providers.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The data gathered in the "Restricted Use Data Category" may be used to create specialized customer-specific machine learning models to enable certain platform features. We do not use data from one customer to train a different customer's model. We do not use third party services
                    to train these models.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Data collected outside of the "Restricted Use Data Category" — such as through website interactions or event participation — may be used for marketing and advertising, where such use is legally allowed. This data is processed under different procedures from the "Restricted Use
                    Data Category".
                </p>

                <p>Specifically, we use personal data not in the "Restricted Use Data Category" for the following purposes (and in reliance on the legal bases for processing noted next to them, as appropriate):</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Customer and User personal data</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To facilitate, operate, enhance, and provide our Services (Performance of Contract; Legitimate Interests);</li>

                        <li>To provide our Customers and Users with assistance and support, to test and monitor the Services, or diagnose or fix technology problems, and to train our Customers and Customer-facing staff (Performance of Contract; Legitimate Interests);</li>

                        <li>
                            To personalize our Services, including by recognizing an individual and remembering their information when they return to our Services, and to provide further localization and personalization capabilities to make our Services easier to use (Performance of Contract;
                            Legitimate Interests);
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            To facilitate and optimize our marketing campaigns, ad management and sales operations, and to manage and deliver advertisements for our products and services more effectively, including on other websites and applications. Such activities allow us to highlight the
                            benefits of using our Services, and thereby increase your engagement and overall satisfaction with our Services. This includes contextual, behavioral and interests-based advertising based on your activity, preferences or other data available to us or to our business
                            partners (Legitimate Interests; Consent);
                        </li>

                        <li>To facilitate, sponsor and offer certain events, contests and promotions (Legitimate Interests).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Customer, User and Prospect personal data</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To gain a better understanding on how individuals use and interact with our Services, which content and data they have processed through our Services, and how we could improve their and others’ user experience and the value they can generate from using the Services, so we
                            could continue improving our products, offerings and the overall performance of our Services, including through the utilization and optimization of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning capabilities (Legitimate Interests);
                        </li>

                        <li>To contact our Customers, Users and Prospects with general or personalized service-related messages, as well as promotional messages that may be of specific interest to them (Performance of Contract; Legitimate Interests; Consent);</li>

                        <li>To support and enhance our data security measures, including for the purposes of preventing and mitigating the risks of fraud, error or any illegal, criminal or prohibited activity (Performance of Contract; Legitimate Interests; Legal Obligation);</li>

                        <li>
                            To create aggregated statistical data, inferred non-personal data, or anonymized or pseudonymized data (rendered non-personal and non-identifiable), which we or our business partners may use to provide and improve our respective services, or for any other purpose
                            (Legitimate Interests);
                        </li>

                        <li>To enforce our Terms and Conditions, to resolve disputes, to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights, and to protect our business interests and the interests and rights of third parties (Legitimate Interests);</li>

                        <li>To comply with our contractual and legal obligations and requirements, and maintain our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards (Performance of Contract; Legitimate Interests; Legal Obligation); and</li>

                        <li>For any other lawful purpose, or other purpose that you consent to (Legal Obligation; Consent).</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <li>Data Location</li>

                <p>We and our authorized Service Providers (defined below) maintain, store and process personal data in the United Kingdom and other locations, as reasonably necessary for the proper performance and delivery of our Services, or as may be required by law.</p>

                <p>
                    While privacy laws may vary between jurisdictions, Four/Four is committed to protect personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and customary industry standards, and such appropriate lawful mechanisms and contractual terms requiring adequate data protection, regardless
                    of any lesser legal requirements that may apply in the jurisdiction to which such data is transferred.
                </p>

                <li>Data Retention</li>

                <p>
                    We retain personal data for as long as we deem it as reasonably necessary in order to maintain and expand our relationship and provide you with our Services and offerings; in order to comply with our legal and contractual obligations; or to protect ourselves from any potential
                    disputes (i.e., as required by laws applicable to log-keeping, records and bookkeeping, and in order to have proof and evidence concerning our relationship, should any legal issues arise following your discontinuance of use), all in accordance with our data retention policy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
                    the applicable legal requirements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have any questions about our data retention policy, please contact us by e-mail at

                </p>

                <li>Data Disclosure</li>

                <p>We disclose personal data in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Service Providers: We may engage selected third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf or complementary to our own. Such service providers include hosting and server co-location services, communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), data
                        security services, billing and payment processing services, fraud detection and prevention services, web and product analytics, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, content transcription and analysis
                        services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, social and advertising networks, content and data enrichment providers, event production and hosting services, e-mail, voicemails, support, enablement and customer relation management systems, and
                        our legal, financial and compliance advisors (collectively, “Service Providers“). Our Service Providers may have access to personal information, depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services, and may only use the data as
                        determined in our agreements with them.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Partnerships: We engage selected business and channel partners, resellers, distributors and providers of professional services related to our Services, which allow us to explore and pursue growth opportunities by facilitating a stronger local presence and tailored experiences
                        for our Customers, Users and Prospects. In such instances, we may share relevant contact, business and usage details with the respective partner, to allow them to engage with those entities and individuals for such purposes. If you directly engage with any of our partners,
                        please note that any aspect of that engagement which is not directly related to the Services and directed by Four/Four is beyond the scope of Four/Four’s Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy and may therefore be covered by the partner’s terms and privacy policy.

                        Service Integrations: You may choose to use a third-party service to integrate with our Services, for example in order to upload or retrieve personal data to or from the Services, or to enrich the data you have processed on either service or enhance your usage thereof
                        (provided that such integration is supported by our Services). The provider of this integrated third-party service may receive certain relevant data about or from your account on the Services, or share certain relevant data from your account on the third-party provider’s
                        service with our Services, depending on the nature and purpose of such integration. This could include your Customer Data and/or User Data. Note that we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third-party services (but do typically require your API key in
                        order to integrate with them).

                    <li>
                        Event Sponsors: If you attend an event or webinar organized by us, or download or access an asset on our Sites related to such an event, webinar or other activity involving third-party sponsors or presenters, we may share your personal data with them. If required by
                        applicable law, you may consent to such sharing via the registration form or by allowing your attendee badge to be scanned at a sponsor booth. In these circumstances, your personal data will be subject to the sponsors’ privacy statements. If you do not wish for your personal
                        data to be shared, you may choose to not opt-in via event/webinar registration or elect to not have your badge scanned, or you can opt-out in accordance with Section 9 below;
                    </li>

                    <li>Business Customers: Our Customers have access to any personal data we process on their behalf in our capacity as a “processor” or a “service provider.”</li>

                    <li>
                        Legal Compliance: We may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your personal data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or
                        access may occur if we believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b) disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such
                        disclosure is required to protect our legitimate business interests, including the security or integrity of our products and services.
                    </li>

                    <li>Protecting Rights and Safety: We may share personal data with others if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of Four/Four, any of our Users or Customers, or any members of the general public.</li>

                    <li>
                        Four/Four Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies: We may share personal data internally within our group, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, should Four/Four or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates undergo any change in control or ownership,
                        including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all or part of its assets, personal data may be shared with or transferred to the parties involved in such an event. We may disclose personal data to a third party during negotiation of, in connection with
                        or as an asset in such a corporate business transaction. Personal data may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.

                </ul>
                <p>
                    For the avoidance of doubt, Four/Four may share personal data in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal, non-identifiable and anonymous. We may transfer, share or
                    otherwise use non-personal and non-identifiable data at our sole discretion and without the need for further approval.

                    We and our Service Providers use cookies, pixels and other technologies to enable and improve the Services we provide, to track the performance of our Sites, perform analytics and gain insights on the use of our Services and the performance of our activities, and for
                    personalization purposes.

                    Cookies are packets of information sent to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the server that sent the cookie. Some cookies are removed when you close your browser session. These are the “Session Cookies”. Some last for longer periods and are
                    called “Persistent Cookies”. We use both types.
                </p>

                <p>We use “Persistent Cookies” to remember your log-in details and make it easier for you to log-in the next time you access the Platform. We may use this type of cookies and Session Cookies for additional purposes, to facilitate the use of the Services’ features and tools.</p>

                    Some cookies are necessary for the Services to function properly, and cannot be declined or disabled unless you delete and block them through your web browser settings. Other cookies, which are used for functional, performance, analytics and marketing purposes, are optional.
                    These include web analytics tools, such as Apollo. These tools help us understand Users’ behavior on our Services, including by tracking page content, and click/touch, movements, scrolls and keystroke activities. Further information about the privacy practices of our analytics
                    service providers and their opt-out policies are available on their websites.

                    You may opt-in or opt-out to the use of such optional cookies through the cookie banner at the top of this page. If you choose to opt-out of certain cookies, this will typically generate a new cookie which will preserve your choice, and indicate it to our Services in your next
                    visits so that the cookies you opted-out of will not be utilized. You can also manage your cookies preferences, and accept, remove or entirely block cookies, through your browser settings. Certain web browsers may transmit “Do Not Track” signals to websites with which the browser
                    communicates. However, due to differences in how web browsers interpret this feature and send those signals, and lack of standardization, we currently do not respond to such “Do Not Track” signals.

                    Please note that if you get a new device, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), you may also clear the opt-out cookies installed once you opt-out, so an additional opt-out will be necessary to prevent
                    additional tracking.

                    We use Hotjar in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what
                    users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and
                    stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user
                    profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.

                <li>Communications</li>

                <p>We engage in service and promotional communications, through e-mail, phone, SMS and notifications.</p>

                <p>
                    Service Communications: We may contact you with important information regarding our Services. For example, we may send you notifications (through any of the means available to us) of changes or updates to our Services, billing issues, log-in attempts or password reset notices,
                    etc. If you are registered as a User to our Services, you can typically control your communications and notifications settings from your profile settings, or otherwise in accordance with the instructions included in the communications sent to you. Please note that you will not be
                    able to opt out of receiving certain service communications which are integral to your use (like password resets or billing notices).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Promotional Communications: We may also notify you about new features, additional offerings, events, special opportunities or any other information we think you will find valuable, as our Customer, User or Prospect. We may provide such notices through any of the contact means
                    available to us (e.g., phone, mobile or e-mail), through the Services, or through our marketing campaigns on any other sites or platforms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you do not wish to receive such promotional communications, you may notify Four/Four at any time by sending an e-mail to:
                    <a class="text-ff-brand-orange" href="mailto:hello@fourfour.ai">hello@fourfour.ai</a>
                    , or by following the “unsubscribe”, “stop”, “opt-out” or “change e-mail preferences” instructions contained in the promotional communications you receive.
                </p>

                <li>Data Security</li>

                <p>
                    We implement systems, applications and procedures designed to secure your personal data, to minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information. However, we cannot guarantee that our Sites or Services will be immune from any
                    wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.
                </p>

                <li>Data Subject Rights</li>

                <p>
                    Under the UK GDPR, you have several rights in relation to your personal data. These include the right to access, rectify, erase, and restrict processing of your data, the right to data portability, and the right to object to data processing. You also have rights related to
                    automated decision-making and profiling. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at
                    <a class="text-ff-brand-orange" href="mailto:hello@fourfour.ai">hello@fourfour.ai</a>
                    . You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's supervisory authority for data protection issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please note that when you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal data related to others and to ask
                    you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access. If your request relates to personal data that may be processed on our Customer’s behalf, as their “data processor” or “service provider” (as further explained in
                    Section 10 below), note that such Customer exclusively determines how such data is processed, as well as if and how your request should be handled – so we advise that you submit your request directly to them. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient
                    information that enables us to reasonably verify that you are the individual about whom we collected the personal data, or that such data is processed on behalf of one of our Customers, so that we may forward it to such Customer for their further handling. Such additional
                    information may be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g., as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request, or proof of request fulfillment).
                </p>

                <p>We may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data or confidential information related to others.</p>

                <li>Data Controller/Processor</li>

                <p>
                    Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the “data controller”, who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “data processor”, who processes the data on
                    behalf of the data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Four/Four is the “data controller” of Prospect Data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will
                    assume the role of “data processor”.
                </p>

                <p>Four/Four is the “data processor” of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our Customer (who is the “data controller” of such data); and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the “sub-processors” of such data.</p>

                <p>
                    For the purposes of UK GDPR, Four/Four acts as a data controller when processing User Data for its operational uses and as a data processor when handling Customer Data under the instruction of our Customers, who are the data controllers for this data. This distinction is crucial
                    for compliance with UK data protection laws and determines the responsibilities and obligations in the processing of personal data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accordingly, Four/Four processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with our Customer’s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our
                    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
<a href="https://fourfour.ai/dpa" class="not-prose cursor-pointer text-ff-brand-orange">Data Processing Addendum</a>
                    and other commercial agreements with such Customer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our Customers are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services, and for ensuring that all individuals using the Services on the Customer’s behalf or at their request, as well as all individuals whose personal data may be included in Customer
                    Data processed through the Services, have been provided with adequate notice and given informed consent to the processing of their personal data, where such consent is necessary or advised, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording, use or other
                    processing of data through our Services are fully met by the Customer, including specifically in the context of an employment relationship. Our Customers are also responsible for handling data subject rights requests under applicable law, by their Users and other individuals
                    whose data they process through the Services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Any transfer of personal data outside of the UK will be conducted in compliance with the UK GDPR and other relevant laws, ensuring that your personal data is protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy. This may involve transferring personal data to countries
                    deemed to have an adequate level of protection by the UK or using specific contracts approved by the UK that provide personal data the same protection it has in the UK.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Updates and Amendments: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version on our Services. The amended version will be effective as of the date it is published. We will provide prior notice if we believe that the changes involved
                    materially alter your rights, via any of the communication means available to us or via the Services. After such notice period, all amendments shall be deemed accepted by you.

                    External Links: While our Services may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to pay attention when you leave our Services for the website or application of such third parties, and to read the privacy
                    policies of each and every website and service you visit. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Services.

                    Children: Our Services are not designed to attract children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children and do not wish to do so. If we learn that a person under the age of 16 is using the Services, we will attempt to prohibit and block such use
                    and will make our best efforts to promptly delete any personal data stored with us with regard to such child. If you believe that we might have any such data, please contact us by e-mail at
