(CLIPr) welcomes you. <br><br>Our Services are subject to the following &nbsp;privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. &nbsp;By accepting this Privacy Policy, accessing or using the Services, or otherwise manifesting your assent to &nbsp;this Privacy Policy, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use, &nbsp;which together make up the Agreement. <br><br>If you do not agree to (or cannot comply with) all of the terms of &nbsp;this Privacy Policy or any other terms of the Agreement, you may not access or use the Services. <br><br>If you accept or agree to this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and &nbsp;warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to the Agreement and, in such &nbsp;event, “you” and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity. &nbsp;<br><br>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use. <br><br>‍<strong>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT <br><br></strong>In the course of operating the Services, CLIPr collects or receives the following types of information, which &nbsp;may include personal information.<br><br>‍<strong>Contact Information<br></strong>We collect contact information through our Services; contact information typically includes your name, &nbsp;email address, postal address, username and password, and any information you provide in messages to us. &nbsp;We use such contact information for purposes such as adding you to the invitation list to use the Services, &nbsp;registering you for an account, providing you with information about the Services, responding to your &nbsp;inquiries, sending you email alerts (including marketing emails), or providing you the Services.<br><br>‍<strong>Activity Information<br></strong>The Services allow you to submit Recordings and to receive Recaps (Clips) of such Recordings. We will &nbsp;therefore collect and have access to any content contained in such Recordings. We will only use Recordings &nbsp;to provide the Services. However, we may use Recaps (Clips), which may contain parts of Recordings, for &nbsp;the purposes of promoting CLIPr’s Services.<br>‍<br>‍<strong>Third-Party Data Integrations <br></strong>We may collect information about you through third-party integrations such as our integration with Google &nbsp;API Services (such information, “Third-Party User Data”). We will only use Third Party User Data to &nbsp;provide the Services to you and to improve the Services. Our use of Third-Party User Data is limited to the &nbsp;disclosures in this Privacy Policy, and complies with all applicable use requirements and restrictions on use &nbsp;imposed by the third-party partner, some of which are set forth in more detail below.<br><br><strong>Google API Services </strong><br>We comply with the Google API Services User Data Policy and the Limited Use requirements applicable &nbsp;to restricted scope data (“Restricted Scope Data”) set forth therein in connection with our collection and &nbsp;use of user data from Google API Services. <br><br>Notwithstanding any other disclosures made in this Privacy Policy, we will only transfer Restricted Scope Data to others if that transfer is (a) necessary to provide or &nbsp;improve related features of our Services, (b) to comply with applicable laws, or (c) in connection with a &nbsp;business transfer as described below in the section titled “Business Transfers”. <br><br>We will not use Restricted &nbsp;Scope Data to serve users advertisements and will not permit humans to read Restricted Scope Data without &nbsp;your consent for specific messages, unless necessary for security purposes, to comply with applicable laws, &nbsp;or the Restricted Scope Data has been aggregated and anonymized for use solely in connection with our &nbsp;internal operations. &nbsp;<br><br>‍<strong>Server Log Information <br>‍</strong>Our servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain &nbsp;data about the nature of such access, including the device’s IP address, user agent string (e.g., operating &nbsp;system and browser type/version), and the pages you’ve clicked on while on our Services, and details &nbsp;regarding your activity on the Services such as time spent on the Services and other performance and usage &nbsp;data. We may use these log files for purposes such as assisting in monitoring and troubleshooting errors &nbsp;and incidents, analyzing traffic, or optimizing the user experience.<br><br>‍<strong>Cookies <br></strong>We may collect information using “cookie” and other similar technologies. Cookies are small packets of &nbsp;data that a website stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive (or other storage medium) so &nbsp;that your computer will “remember” information about your use. We use both 1st and 3rd-party session &nbsp;cookies and persistent cookies. Below is a general primer on session and persistent cookies; information &nbsp;collected by cookies depends on its particular purpose. For more information, please see the information &nbsp;regarding analytics providers discussed further below.<br>&nbsp;<br>● <strong>Session Cookies</strong>: We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Services. A &nbsp;session ID cookie expires when you close the Services. &nbsp;<br>‍<br>● <strong>Persistent Cookies</strong>: A persistent cookie remains on your device for an extended period of time or &nbsp;until you delete them. To the extent we provide a log-in portal or related feature on our Services, persistent &nbsp;cookies can be used to store your passwords so that you don’t have to enter it more than once. Additionally, &nbsp;persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our visitors to personalize the experience of &nbsp;our Services. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your device, you may be able to turn that feature off on your &nbsp;device. Please consult your browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete &nbsp;persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, certain aspects of the Services &nbsp;may not function properly or as intended.<br><br>‍<strong>Third-Party Analytics Providers<br></strong>We use one or more third–party analytics services to evaluate your use of the Services, as the case may be, &nbsp;by compiling reports on activity (based on their collection of IP addresses, Internet service provider, &nbsp;browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, data and time, amount of &nbsp;time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Services you visit, number of links clicked, search terms &nbsp;and other similar usage data) and analyzing performance metrics.<br><br>These third parties use cookies and other &nbsp;technologies to help collect, analyze, and provide us reports or other data. &nbsp;By accessing and using the Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics &nbsp;providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. For more information on these third parties, including how to opt out from certain data collection, please visit the sites below. Please be &nbsp;advised that if you opt out of any service, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Services.<br><br> For Google Analytics, please visit: <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/analytics</a> &nbsp;For Hotjar, please visit: <a href="https://www.hotjar.com" target="_blank">https://www.hotjar.com</a> <br><br>‍<strong>Aggregate Data <br></strong>In an ongoing effort to better understand our Website visitors, Platform users, and the Services, we might &nbsp;analyze your information in aggregate form to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Services. This &nbsp;aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with vendors, &nbsp;and our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics to describe &nbsp;the Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.<strong><br></strong><br>‍<strong>Onward Transfer to Third Parties <br>‍</strong>● Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We &nbsp;may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed &nbsp;to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information and &nbsp;their functions are: hosting services, technical assistance, database management/back-up services, use &nbsp;analytics, email marketing platforms, and customer service. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>● Except as otherwise provided herein, to provide our Services and administer promotional programs, &nbsp;we may share your personal information with our third-party promotional and marketing partners, &nbsp;including, without limitation, businesses participating in our various programs.<br>&nbsp;<br>● Except as otherwise provided herein, we may, from time to time, share and/or license personal &nbsp;information to other companies who may provide you information about the products and services they or &nbsp;their partners offer. However, to the extent required by law, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of &nbsp;such sharing. &nbsp;<br>‍<br>● Except as otherwise provided herein, we may also disclose personal information to our parent &nbsp;companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures, or other companies under common control to support the &nbsp;marketing and sale of the Services.<br> <br>‍<strong>Business Transfers <br>‍</strong>In the event of a merger, dissolution, reorganization or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or &nbsp;substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal &nbsp;information, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such &nbsp;transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such &nbsp;personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This policy shall be binding upon CLIPr and its &nbsp;legal successors in interest.<br><br>‍<strong>Disclosure to Public Authorities <br>‍</strong>We are required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, &nbsp;including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also &nbsp;disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or &nbsp;required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.<br><br>‍<strong>OPT-OUT FOR DIRECT MARKETING; DELETION REQUESTS <br>‍</strong>You may opt out at any time from the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes by &nbsp;emailing the instructions to mktg@clipr.ai or by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link located on the bottom &nbsp;of any CLIPr marketing email and following the instructions found on the page to which the link takes you. &nbsp;<br><br>Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request. You cannot opt out of receiving transactional e mails related to the Services. &nbsp;You may request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you or maintain about &nbsp;you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and verify your request, we will delete your personal &nbsp;information from our records, unless an exception applies. <br><br>To request deletion of your personal information, &nbsp;please email your request to <a href="mailto:mktg@clipr.ai?subject=Personal%20Information%20Deletion%20Request">mktg@clipr.ai</a>.

We &nbsp;cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity &nbsp;and confirm personal information is related to you. <br><br>‍<strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION <br>‍</strong>CLIPr takes very seriously the security and privacy of the personal information that it collects pursuant to &nbsp;this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we implement reasonable security measures designed to protect your &nbsp;personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, &nbsp;taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and to comply with &nbsp;applicable laws and regulations.

We &nbsp;cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the databases of the third parties with which we may share &nbsp;your information (as permitted herein), nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be &nbsp;intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to us may not be secure, &nbsp;and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.<br><br>‍<strong>CHILDREN &nbsp;<br></strong>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through the Services. &nbsp;If you are under 13, please do not give us any personal information. We encourage parents and legal &nbsp;guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing &nbsp;their children to never provide personal information without their permission.
