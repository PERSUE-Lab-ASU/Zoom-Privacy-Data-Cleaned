                we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical,
                if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances,
                we will still respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need you to provide us
                with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.

                regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Indi in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers,
                and you authorize Indi to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. You hereby consent to the
                transfer of your data to the U.S. pursuant to: (i) a data processing agreement incorporating standard data protection clauses promulgated by the
                European Commission, a copy of which can be obtained at

                We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, but we will alert you to any such changes by placing a
                notice on the Indi website, by sending you an email and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us
                (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for
                reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted,
                that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
