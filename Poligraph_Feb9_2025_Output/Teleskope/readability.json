To use Teleskope Services, Customers and individuals provide Teleskope with various information necessary to create a company account such as company domain name, company logo, contact email address, contact name, contact title, contact office location, password and/or similar account details. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Teleskope (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address. Though in most cases that information is business or proprietary information of Customers, rather than personal data, sometimes some personal data may constitute some part of that information.</span></span></span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span><span><span>Usage Information as follows:</span></span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span><span><span>Services Metadata. When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way Authorized Users work and for troubleshooting and reporting purposes.

Customer can choose to permit or restrict its Authorized Users to enable and disable Third Party Services for their ERGs and other Services.

Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices of those Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Teleskope.

To use Teleskope Services, Customers and individuals provide Teleskope with various information necessary to create a company account such as company domain name, company logo, contact email address, contact name, contact title, contact office location, password and/or similar account details. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Teleskope (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address. Though in most cases that information is business or proprietary information of Customers, rather than personal data, sometimes some personal data may constitute some part of that information.\n\n\nUsage Information as follows:\n\n\n\nServices Metadata.

Customer can choose to permit or restrict its Authorized Users to enable and disable Third Party Services for their ERGs and other Services. Typically, Third Party Services are software and platforms that integrate with our Services which may share with us some personal data of you or other persons.

Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices of those Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Teleskope.
