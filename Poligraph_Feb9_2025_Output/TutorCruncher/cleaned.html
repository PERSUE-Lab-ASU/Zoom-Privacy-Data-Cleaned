TutorCruncher cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to protect your login information. If you know or suspect that anyone other than you knows your user identification code or password, you must promptly notify us.</li><li>You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction or the UK (including but not limited to copyright laws and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Business Regulations 2003 (as amended from time to time)). You agree to indemnify us in respect of any breach or violation of any such laws, meaning that you will be liable for any loss or damage we suffer as a result of or in connection with such breach or violation.</li><li>You are responsible for all Content posted, activity conducted and all persons who access (or even just view or see screenshots of) our Services through your account or internet connection. You should not permit any person who is not the account holder to access or interact with your account or our Services without first making them aware of these Terms of Service. In any event, all such activity that occurs under your account including Content posted by or suggested by other people shall be your responsibility (save where TutorCruncher has accessed or is performing maintenance on any part of the site or your account).</li><li>You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content, but you are required to, and you hereby do, grant TutorCruncher a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform that user-generated content in connection with the Services.</li><li>We do not guarantee that our Services or any content on our site, will always be available or be uninterrupted. We may suspend or withdraw or restrict the availability of all or any part of our Services for business and operational reasons. We will try to give you reasonable notice of any suspension or withdrawal.</li></ol><h3><strong>Section B: Payments and Refunds</strong></h3><ol><li>If you sign up for a free trial on a paying account, and you do not cancel or become a full member within 14 days, you will be sent an e-mail inviting you to begin paying for your subscription. If you choose not to pay once your trial has expired, your account will be suspended until payment is received.

This may be charged upfront or retroactively depending on your price plan.</li><li>A fee for ‘Online payments’, which is a percentage of all payments made through our online card payment system. These fees are taken at the time of transaction.</li><li>A fee for ‘Offline payments’, which is a percentage of all lessons and ad hoc charges put through the system that haven’t been paid for using the online card payment system. These fees are generated at the end of each month and charged in arrears. This is worked out by taking the sum of all charges for complete or “cancelled but chargeable” appointments and undeleted Ad Hoc Charges for each calendar month, then subtracting the sum of the payments made via the online card payment system.</li><li>If you avoid putting charge amounts through TutorCruncher by not invoicing to avoid fees and if it comes to our attention this has happened without any agreement made to allow you to do so, TutorCruncher is in the right to collect the amount owed as per your contracted fees.</li></ol><h3><strong>Section D: Cancellation and Termination</strong></h3><ol><li>You alone are responsible for the proper cancellation of your account.

If any further data is required TutorCruncher will make a reasonable effort to provide that data in a usable format charging a reasonable hourly rate for that work (being no less than £100 per hour).</li><li>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will receive one final invoice usage in the month of cancellation.</li><li>Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content associated with your Account.</li><li>TutorCruncher reserves the right to refuse service to any new customer for any reason.</li><li>TutorCruncher reserves the right to modify the service at any time without notice.
