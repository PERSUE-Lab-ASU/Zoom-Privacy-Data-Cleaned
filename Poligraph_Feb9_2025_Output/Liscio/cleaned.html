(“<strong>Liscio</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>“, “<strong>us</strong>“) collects and processes Personal Information.Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.&nbsp; When you submit information to us, you consent to the processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<br><span class="section-header">1. Scope</span><br>This Privacy Policy applies to public areas of liscio.me and its affiliated websites (collectively, “<strong>Sites</strong>“) as well as subscription services available only to registered users in or to which this Privacy Policy is linked or posted (collectively with the Sites, the “Services“).<br><br>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that is collected offline or by any third-party websites or services that you access through the Services.&nbsp; <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.<br><br></strong>Our right to process information also may be described in our agreements with our customers (“Customer Agreements“).&nbsp; If a provision of a Customer Agreement conflicts or otherwise is inconsistent with a provision of this Privacy Policy, then the term of the Customer Agreement will prevail to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.<br><br>In this Privacy Policy, to “process” Personal Information means to perform any operation on Personal Information, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organizing, storing, adapting, use, disclosure, combining, erasing or destroying.<br><br><span class="section-header">&nbsp;2. Changes to this privacy policy</span><br>The Effective Date of this Privacy Policy is set forth at the top of this webpage.&nbsp; As we add new features to the Services, we may amend this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy that reduces your privacy rights, we will notify you in advance through the Services.&nbsp; Your continued use of the Services after the Effective Date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. The amended Privacy Policy supersedes all previous versions.<br><br><span class="section-header">&nbsp;3. Information we collect<br></span>When you use the Services, we collect two types of information: Personal Information and Usage Data.<br><br>In this Privacy Policy, “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means any information that identifies or could be used to identify an individual. Personal Information does not include aggregated information to the extent that an individual’s identity cannot be derived from it. Personal Information includes your contact data (name, telephone number, email address and country of residence) and certain (but not all) Usage Data.<br><br>We define “<strong>Usage Data</strong>” as information about an individual’s activity on or through the Services that, by itself, does not identify the individual, such as browser type, operating system and webpages visited.&nbsp; Generally, we do not consider Usage Data as Personal Information because Usage Data by itself usually does not identify an individual.&nbsp; Usage Data may, however, be Personal Information under certain laws because it could be used to indirectly identify an individual.<br><br>Before collecting your personal information, we will obtain your explicit consent where required. We record and store consent to ensure that we can demonstrate compliance with applicable data protection laws. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at support@liscio.me.<br><br>We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. Once the information is no longer required, we securely delete or anonymize it.<br><br>You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we collect and process about you. To request access, please contact us at support@lisico.me. If your personal information has been deleted or anonymized, we will inform you of this in our response.<br><br><span class="section-header">&nbsp;4. How we collect information<br></span><strong><em>When you Use the Services</em>:</strong>&nbsp; When you subscribe to or otherwise use the Services, we collect business information, such as names, business names, business addresses, email addresses, business phone numbers and any other information that you provide us. We may from time to time conduct surveys to better understand the needs and profiles of our users. You may choose whether to participate in any survey.<br><br>We also collect information through our server logs.&nbsp; A server log is a list of the activities that a server performs.&nbsp; Liscio’s servers automatically collect and store in server logs your search queries, Internet Protocol (IP) address, hardware type, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL and certain cookies that identify your browser or Liscio account.<br><br>We collect information about your computer, tablet or mobile telephone (“<strong>Device</strong>“), such as device ID, model, operating system version, mobile network information, telephone number, internet service provider and similar identifiers.&nbsp; Liscio may associate your Device information with your Liscio account.&nbsp; We may collect and store information (including Personal Information) on your Device through browser web and web application data caches.<br><br>Liscio offers mobile applications (“<strong>Apps</strong>“).&nbsp; Liscio collects information about your use of and interaction with the App, such as your Device’s operating system, browser type, domain, search queries, the country and time zone in which your Device is located.<br><br><strong><em>Through Service Providers</em>:</strong>&nbsp; Third parties that assist us with our business operations also collect information through the Services.&nbsp; For example, service providers collect information to help us detect and prevent fraud.<br><br><strong><em>Through Data Collection Technolog</em>y:</strong> We use cookies, pixel tabs (also known as web beacons, flash cookies and clear GIFs) and similar technology (“Data Collection Technology“) to automatically collect information about you when you use the Services.&nbsp; Please read below to learn more about how Liscio uses Data Collection Technology.<br><br><span class="section-header">&nbsp;5. Cookies and other data collection technology<br></span>Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer’s hard drive.&nbsp; A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your computer, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using the Services.&nbsp; A web beacon (also called a pixel tag or clear GIF) is a piece of computer code that enables us to monitor user activity and website traffic.&nbsp; To learn more about cookies and web beacons, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.<br><br><strong><em>How We Use Data Collection Technology</em>:</strong> Data Collection Technology helps us improve your experience of the Services by, for example, storing your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Services, measuring the success of marketing campaigns, compiling statistics about use of the Services and helping us analyze technical and navigational information about the Services and to detect and prevent fraud.<br>The Services use the following cookies:</p><ul role="list"><li class="list-item-14"><em>Strictly necessary cookies</em>, which are required for the operation of the Services. Without them, for example, you would not be able to register or log in for the Services that we may offer.</li><li class="list-item-14"><em>Analytical/performance cookies,</em> which allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors, to learn how visitors navigate the Services and to help us to improve the way Services function.</li><li class="list-item-14"><em>Functionality cookies</em>, which are used to recognize you when you return to the Services.</li></ul><p class="paragraph-27">We also use Google Analytics which is a Google service that uses Data Collection Technology to collect anonymous information about use of the Services and report website trends.&nbsp; Google Analytics does not identify individual users.&nbsp; We may use an enhancement to Google Analytics called “Demographics and Interest Reporting,” through which Google provides us with information about our users’ demographics (e.g., age, gender) and interests. This information, which Google may collect by tracking a user’s behavior across third-party websites, helps us to learn more about our users.&nbsp; You can learn about Google’s practices in connection with this enhanced tracking and opt out of it by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">www.google.com/settings/ads</a> or by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.<br><br>We also may use other Data Collection Technology to collect information from the computer or device that you use to access the Services, such as your operating system type, browser type, and domain, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone in which your computer or device is located. We do this to improve the quality of the services we offer.<br><br><strong><em>Your Control of Cookies</em>:</strong> Some web browsers (including some mobile web browsers) provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device.&nbsp; You also may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required to accept cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Services.<br><br><strong><em>Our Policy On Do Not Track Signals</em>:</strong> Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“<strong>DNT</strong>“) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.&nbsp; If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain Personal Information about the browser’s user.&nbsp; Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.&nbsp; For this reason, many website operators, including Liscio, do not respond to DNT signals.<br><br><span class="section-header">6.
