Such staff or subcontractors may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details or the provision of support services.

Other users may access the Website from outside the EEA. This means that where you chose to post your data on our Website, it could be accessed from anywhere around the world and therefore a transfer of your data outside of the EEA may be deemed to have occurred.
