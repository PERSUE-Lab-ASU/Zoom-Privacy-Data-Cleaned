                              </p><h2>GDPR compliance and Privacy Shield</h2>
                              <p>For a detailed list of data sub-processors under the GDPR please see above under "Sharing of Data".
                              </p><h2>Your Data Protection Rights Under The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
                              <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following data protection rights:
                  You can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. You can exercise these rights by emailing support@teamcalendar.ai.
                  You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing support@teamcalendar.ai.
                  Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
                  You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
                              </p><p>If you want to request an export or deletion of your personal data, and have an account with us, please contact us at support@teamcalendar.ai. Please note that we cannot delete personal data in open accounts when you’re not the account owner, as this would prevent us from providing the service the account owner is paying for (We suggest that you contact the account owner of the Team Calendar AI account in question to ask them to anonymize or remove your data).
                  We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
                              </p><h2>International data transfers</h2>
                              <p>GDPR includes provisions on international data transfer mechanisms. In order to comply with these provisions, we have certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks.
                              </p><h2>Application Data and Backups</h2>
                              <p>In order to accommodate customers who need older data restored, we keep backups indefinitely and cannot delete personal data from them. These backups are read-only, heavily encrypted/compressed, and stored off-site. If we do have access or restore data to our production systems or for purposes of debugging, any deletions of personal data will be applied retroactively or the personal data will be anonymized.
                              </p><h2>Log files</h2>
                              <p>We store server log files for (up to) one year for the purposes of debugging errors and helping customers find out when specific data changes happened and who did them; and for preventing fraud and providing the necessary information when fraud is suspected.
                  We keep copies of all purchasing records for tax and auditing purposes.
                              </p><h2>Personal Metadata</h2>
                              <p>We keep personal metadata, given that the user allows us to process their data, which can be controlled by going to the Privacy tab in Settings &amp; Profile.
                                When a user chooses to opt out of a specific type of data processing, we cease sending any additional data to the relevant data controller(s). Every quarter, we contact our data processors with a list of users who have opted out of allowing us to process their personal data in the specific manner that we use their tools.
                                We will respond to Data Subject Rights Requests within the appropriate amount of time.
                  Some 3rd party services collect data independently from us, and have incorporated it as part of their service.
                  Requests for data collected and controlled by third-party services should be directed to them, as we do not maintain copies of this data nor have control over it.
                              </p><h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
                              <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make any significant changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Website or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.
                  Changes to this Privacy Policy may go into effect immediately to ensure that we can provide the Service without interruptions (for example, we may have to switch 3rd-party providers of application features on short notice if they experience technical difficulties or go out of business).
                              </p><h2>Questions and contact information</h2>
                              <p>Should you have any questions or concerns, please write to support@teamcalendar.ai, or write to:</p>
