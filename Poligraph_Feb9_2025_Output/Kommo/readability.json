Do Not Track Policy</h2>\n<div>\n<p><spaceless>California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated \u201cDo Not Track\u201d features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals.</spaceless></p>\n<p><spaceless>In the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites.

Cookies\n\nLike most websites, we and our Third Party Services (See Section 6 \u201cThird Party Services\u201d) collect certain information automatically when you visit our Service, read our emails, or interact with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, beacons, and similar technology (which we'll refer to collectively as \u201ccookies\u201d). For example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your account, and other such information. We also collect information about the way you use the Service, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Service from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service. We use cookies to better display our Service, to save you time, to provide better technical support, and to anonymously track Service usage. For example, cookies help us to:\n\nKeep track of whether you are signed in or have previously signed in so that we can display all the features that are available to you;\nRemember your settings on the pages you visit, so that we can display your preferred content the next time you visit;\nDisplay personalized content and targeted advertisements on our Service as well as on other websites and services;\nPerform analytics, and measure traffic and usage trends, and better understand the demographics of our users;\nDiagnose and fix technology problems; and\nOtherwise plan for and enhance our Service.\n\nMost or all browsers permit you to disable or reject certain cookies. You can do this by setting the preferences in the browser. Use the \"help\" feature of your browser to obtain more information about refusing cookies. However, if you set the browser you use to reject cookies or otherwise disable them, you may not be able to use any or all of the functionality at one or more of the sites or it may take additional time to utilize such functionality. If you wish to use any such functionality that requires the use of cookies at any of our sites, then you must accept the use of cookies for that site, and thereby, give us your permission to link your data as discussed above.\n\n10. Do Not Track Policy\n\nCalifornia law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated \u201cDo Not Track\u201d features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals.\nIn the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of this online behavioral advertising, visit the following sites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers and http://www.networkadvertising.org.\nThis will opt you out of many, but not all, of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. Choices you make may be browser and device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out choices.

These features will opt a Visitor out of many \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage.\n\n13.

If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner.

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.\nHowever, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

Data Retention\nHow long we retain your Personal Data depends of the type of data and the purpose for which we process the data, which is explained further in the section \u201cThe Information We Collect\u201d.

Data Controller And Data Processor\n\nKommo does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service.

Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.\nThe Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.\nKommo is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors' servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Kommo responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.\n\n19.
