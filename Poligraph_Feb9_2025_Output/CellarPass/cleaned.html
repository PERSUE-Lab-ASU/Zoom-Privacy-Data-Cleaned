A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p><p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register an account with CellarPass, a cookie helps us recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to our website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.</p><p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.

We may also do this on behalf of Businesses, when for example your prior interactions with a Business or the Services indicate you may be interested in certain events or type of activity. You may Opt-out from CellarPass marketing activity by clicking the Unsubscribe link or other provided instruction in emails or SMS messaging. We may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from CellarPass and its affiliates. CellarPass may also contact you to participate in surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered. </p><p>CellarPass keeps track of the pages Guests visit within our websites in order to determine what Services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within the websites we operate to users whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. CellarPass uses tracking pixels to collect information that helps us provide our Service to you. Please note that any "do not track" signals sent by your web browser or other mechanism have no effect on the collection of personally identifiable information by CellarPass. In addition, other parties who perform data analytics for CellarPass, such as Google Analytics, AdRoll, Double Click and Hotjar, may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities when you use our Services. Third party affiliates of CellarPass may have different policies with respect to "do not track" signals and CellarPass makes no representations with respect to such policies.</p><p>CellarPass uses tracking to create remarketing audiences of users based on user behavior/their visits to our website. CellarPass may also target these users with custom ads based on affinities/interests, geographic and demographic signals. CellarPass only shares browser-level data through third party vendor tracking such as Google Analytics. Users can opt out of these advertising features by visiting Google or resources like the NAI Guest opt-out page.

In such cases, the third party's use of information furnished by CellarPass is governed by the third party’s privacy policy. Additionally, you may connect your CellarPass account to social media services, such as Facebook in which case we may collect, use, disclose, transfer and store information relating to your account with the third party. This information may include your Facebook id, profile picture, first name, last name, email, location and friends list and use them to connect with your Facebook account to provide access to and certain functionality on the Services, like sharing activities and events you are interested in or are attending.</p><p>CellarPass may provide you with access to contract directly with or integrate with third party services through our Services. When you elect to engage with such third party, we will disclose your Personal Data to other entities in order to fulfill the services you have requested.</p><p><b>4.6 Businesses </b></p><p>We allow Businesses to use our Services to contact Guests for their current and past events, so you may receive emails or other forms of communication (SMS messaging, phone, postal mail) from our system that originate with such Businesses that we are sending on their behalf. If you made a reservation or registered for event on the Services, your Personal Data is available to that Business. However, a Business may also import Personal Data they have from external sources and send communications through the Services on the Business’ behalf. The Business and not CellarPass is responsible for sending such communications.</p><p>In addition, when you reserve or register for an activity or event, sign up for communications or otherwise engage with a Business or participate in a Business’ event, that Business will receive your Personal Data. For example, if you provide your name and email address to register for an activity or event, the Business will receive that information. If you transfer a ticket or register a ticket on behalf of someone else, the Business will receive that Personal Data as well. The Business may then send marketing or other communications, which are subject to its own, separate privacy policy. This also applies to providing mobile phone numbers, you may receive messages related to the Service, event, activity or other information in which you expressed having interest. </p><p>For fundraising events and pages, we may provide your Personal Data to both the Business and the benefitting Charity to which the fundraising event is linked. In some instances, a Business may appoint a third party to create an event or activity on its behalf (“Third Party Businesses”). For instance, a winery (the Business, in this case) may allow production company (Third Party Business) to create events that will be hosted at the Business’ venue using its CellarPass account. In that case, your Personal Data may be provided to Third Party Businesses on behalf of the hosting Business. This also applies to sweepstakes and contests: we may provide your Personal Data to both the Business and any official sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes.</p><p>CellarPass is not responsible for the Businesses, affiliated Charities or Third-Party Businesses in regard to your Personal Data. You should review the policies of Businesses, Charities or Third Party Businesses associated with an activity, event, or contest/sweepstakes you are interested in before providing your Personal Data or other information in relation to that activity, event, fundraising page or contest/sweepstakes.</p><p><b>4.7 Specific Purpose</b></p><p>If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the information in connection with that purpose. For example, if you contact us by email, we will respond to you using the email address provided to answer your question or resolve your problem.</p><p><b>4.8 Legal Requirements</b></p><p>CellarPass may disclose personal information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of personal information.</p><p><b>4.9 Aggregated Data</b></p><p>To better understand and provide our Users with the best experience, we often conduct research on our customer demographics, behaviors, preferences, and interests based on Personal Data. This research is usually completed on an aggregate basis that does not identify you. Once Personal Data is in an aggregated form, it becomes Non-Personal Data.</p><p>More Simply Put:<br> CellarPass does not sell, rent or lease Personal Data. We value our relationship with you and therefore will not sell your Personal Data to third parties. However, there are certain circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your Personal data with others.</p><p><b>5. Security of your Personal Information</b></p><p>CellarPass secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Furthermore, once credit card numbers are entered, they are submitted to the payment processor and no longer stored in the Services. We may store Personal Data with third parties to whom we have transferred it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, no network, server, database, Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or free from errors. As such, you should consider carefully what information you provide to us. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data.</p><p>You are responsible for safeguarding and preventing unauthorized access to the user information and password that you use to access our Services. You agree not to disclose your password to any third-party and you are responsible for any activity using your account, whether or not you authorized that activity. Please immediately notify CellarPass of any unauthorized use of your account.</p><p>More simply put:<br> CellarPass' secure website keeps your personal information safe. You can do your part by keeping your password private.</p><p><b>6. Age Specific Content</b></p><p>Our Services are not intended for use by those under legal drinking age, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of Service. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Users under the legal drinking age. If you become aware that someone under the legal drinking age has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>More simply put:<br> No one under 21 years old should use CellarPass services.</p><p><b>7.

You may exercise these rights by <a href="https://www.cellarpass.com/login">logging in</a> and visiting the My Account page. Both registered and unregistered users may also exercise these rights by contacting us directly by email or at the address specified below.</p><p>If a Guest requests their data to be deleted, CellarPass is authorized to delete or anonymize Personal Data of the requesting Guest from the Services even if that means removing its availability to the Business through the Services. However, if you are a Guest, you understand that even if CellarPass deletes or anonymizes your Persona Data upon your request, your Personal Data may still be available in the Business’ own databases if transmitted to the Business prior to CellarPass receiving or taking action to your request. It is your responsibility to ensure you have no pending reservations or registrations for activities or events on the Services before making your request. You acknowledge that Personal Data deletion or anonymization cannot be undone and may negatively affect any existing reservations and registrations for activities and events that you have registered for and are scheduled to take place after the date of your Personal Data deletion request has been submitted. You agree with these terms and hold CellarPass harmless for any issues or inconveniences related to complying with your Personal Data deletion request.<br> </p><p><b>8. Exclusions</b></p><p><b>8.1 Third Party Links</b></p><p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by CellarPass (“Third Party Sites”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to Third Party Sites. Links from the Services do not imply that we have reviewed or endorse the Third-Party Sites. Contact those sites directly for information regarding their privacy policies.</p><p><b>8.2 Providing Personal Data to Others</b></p><p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any sensitive or Personal Data that you provide to another User or visitor through the Services or any other means, including information posted by you in any public areas of the Services or to Businesses on event pages or through social media platforms.</p><p><b>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p><p>CellarPass may change the provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time and will always post the most up-to-date version on our website.</p><p>More simply put:<br> This is the most recent version of the privacy policy. If we change it, we'll update it here.</p><p><b>10. International Transfers</b></p><p>The Website is hosted in, and our Services are provided from, the United States. Accordingly, by providing your Personal Information through the Website, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information from your country of residence to the United States. With regard to data transfers from the European Economic Area to the U.S., we have self-certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. For more information about our self-certification to the Privacy Shield Framework, please visit here.</p><p>More simply put:<br> CellarPass protects your data by following the Privacy Shield Framework.</p><p><b>11. Contact Information</b></p><p>CellarPass welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p><p>50 California Street, #1500, San Francisco, CA 94111 or by email legal@cellarpass.com.</p><p>More simply put:<br> Feel free to get in touch with us, we're nice people and love to hear feedback!</p><p><b>12. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b></p><p>The GDPR requires us to inform you about the legal ground we’re relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data outlined in section 4 above will typically be because:</p><ul><li>It is necessary for our contractual relationship;</li><li>the processing is in our legitimate interest as a reservation and event ticketing platform (basically, to maintain the security of our systems and to provide you with customer service, etc.)</li><li>the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations</li><li>you provided consent</li></ul><p><b>13. Transfer of Personal Data</b></p><p>As CellarPass provides services internationally, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside the country from which it was originally provided. This may be to Businesses using the Services, or to Third Parties that we work with who may be located jurisdictions outside the EEA, Switzerland and the IK which have no data protection laws or laws that are not as rigid compared with those in Europe. </p><p>Whenever we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we take legally required steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data. For Personal Data we receive, CellarPass has certified its compliance to the EU-U.S. and Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from those countries. We have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield principals of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfers, Security, Data Integrity &amp; Purpose Limitation, Access and Resource, Enforcement &amp; Liability when processing Personal Data from EEA, Switzerland or the UK in the United States.</p><p><b>14. Personal Data Retention</b></p><p>We retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services, or other purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.</p><p>If you have an account with us, we will retain your Personal Data for ninety (90) days after you have requested your account closed or if your account has been inactive for three (3) years. </p><p>Data protection law provides you with rights in respect of Personal Data that we hold about you, including the right to request a copy of the Personal Data, request that we rectify, restrict or delete your Personal Data, object to profiling and unsubscribe from marketing communications.</p><p>You can exercise most of these rights by logging in and visiting the My Account page or changing the “cookie settings” in your browser (see our Cookie statement above). If you cannot find what you are looking for in My Account page, please contact us by using the information provided in section 10 above. Please note that requests to exercise data protection rights will be reviewed by us on a case-by-case basis. We may require proof of identity in order to comply with your request. There may be circumstances where we are not legally required to comply with your request because of the laws in your jurisdiction or because exemptions provided for in data protection legislation.</p><p>If you have questions or complaints on how we handle your Personal Data, please contact us as set forth in section 10 above. If you are not happy with how we have attempted to resolve your complaint, you may contact the relevant data protection authority.</p><p>CellarPass as a data controller and data processor</p><p>EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known at “data controllers”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, these should always be directed to the relevant organization since they are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data.</p><p>CellarPass may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances.</p><p>For example, if you generate a subscription account with us to manage your activities or events, CellarPass will be a data controller in respect to the Personal Data that you provide as part of your account. We will also be a data controller of the Personal Data that we have obtained about the use of the CellarPass Services, which could relate to Businesses or Guests. We use this to conduct research and analysis to help better understand and serve Users of the Services as well as to improve our platform and provide you with targeted recommendations about activities or events we think may be of interest to you.</p><p>However, if you register as a Guest, we will process your Personal Data to help administer that activity or event on behalf of the Business (for example: sending confirmation, promotional and feedback emails, processing payments, etc..) and to help the Business manage their event, understand the success of their event and event planning such as through event reports, guest lists, using analytics to determine effectiveness of various sales channels. In these scenarios, CellarPass just provides tools for Businesses; CellarPass does not decide what Personal Data to request on registration forms, nor is it responsible for the continued accuracy of any Personal Data provided. Questions you may have about your Personal Data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the Business as the data controller, not to CellarPass.</p><p><b>15.
