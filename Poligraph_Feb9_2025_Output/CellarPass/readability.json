In addition, other parties who perform data analytics for CellarPass, such as Google Analytics, AdRoll, Double Click and Hotjar, may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities when you use our Services.

When you elect to engage with such third party, we will disclose your Personal Data to other entities in order to fulfill the services you have requested.</p><p><b>4.6 Businesses </b></p><p>We allow Businesses to use our Services to contact Guests for their current and past events, so you may receive emails or other forms of communication (SMS messaging, phone, postal mail) from our system that originate with such Businesses that we are sending on their behalf. If you made a reservation or registered for event on the Services, your Personal Data is available to that Business. However, a Business may also import Personal Data they have from external sources and send communications through the Services on the Business\u2019 behalf. The Business and not CellarPass is responsible for sending such communications.</p><p>In addition, when you reserve or register for an activity or event, sign up for communications or otherwise engage with a Business or participate in a Business\u2019 event, that Business will receive your Personal Data. For example, if you provide your name and email address to register for an activity or event, the Business will receive that information. If you transfer a ticket or register a ticket on behalf of someone else, the Business will receive that Personal Data as well. The Business may then send marketing or other communications, which are subject to its own, separate privacy policy. This also applies to providing mobile phone numbers, you may receive messages related to the Service, event, activity or other information in which you expressed having interest. </p><p>For fundraising events and pages, we may provide your Personal Data to both the Business and the benefitting Charity to which the fundraising event is linked. In some instances, a Business may appoint a third party to create an event or activity on its behalf (\u201cThird Party Businesses\u201d). For instance, a winery (the Business, in this case) may allow production company (Third Party Business) to create events that will be hosted at the Business\u2019 venue using its CellarPass account. In that case, your Personal Data may be provided to Third Party Businesses on behalf of the hosting Business. This also applies to sweepstakes and contests: we may provide your Personal Data to both the Business and any official sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes.</p><p>CellarPass is not responsible for the Businesses, affiliated Charities or Third-Party Businesses in regard to your Personal Data. You should review the policies of Businesses, Charities or Third Party Businesses associated with an activity, event, or contest/sweepstakes you are interested in before providing your Personal Data or other information in relation to that activity, event, fundraising page or contest/sweepstakes.</p><p><b>4.7 Specific Purpose</b></p><p>If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the information in connection with that purpose. For example, if you contact us by email, we will respond to you using the email address provided to answer your question or resolve your problem.</p><p><b>4.8 Legal Requirements</b></p><p>CellarPass may disclose personal information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of personal information.</p><p><b>4.9 Aggregated Data</b></p><p>To better understand and provide our Users with the best experience, we often conduct research on our customer demographics, behaviors, preferences, and interests based on Personal Data. This research is usually completed on an aggregate basis that does not identify you. Once Personal Data is in an aggregated form, it becomes Non-Personal Data.</p><p>More Simply Put:<br> CellarPass does not sell, rent or lease Personal Data. We value our relationship with you and therefore will not sell your Personal Data to third parties. However, there are certain circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your Personal data with others.</p><p><b>5. Security of your Personal Information</b></p><p>CellarPass secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Furthermore, once credit card numbers are entered, they are submitted to the payment processor and no longer stored in the Services. We may store Personal Data with third parties to whom we have transferred it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, no network, server, database, Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or free from errors. As such, you should consider carefully what information you provide to us. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data.</p><p>You are responsible for safeguarding and preventing unauthorized access to the user information and password that you use to access our Services. You agree not to disclose your password to any third-party and you are responsible for any activity using your account, whether or not you authorized that activity. Please immediately notify CellarPass of any unauthorized use of your account.</p><p>More simply put:<br> CellarPass' secure website keeps your personal information safe. You can do your part by keeping your password private.</p><p><b>6. Age Specific Content</b></p><p>Our Services are not intended for use by those under legal drinking age, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of Service. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Users under the legal drinking age. If you become aware that someone under the legal drinking age has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>More simply put:<br> No one under 21 years old should use CellarPass services.</p><p><b>7.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b></p><p>The GDPR requires us to inform you about the legal ground we\u2019re relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data outlined in section 4 above will typically be because:</p><ul><li>It is necessary for our contractual relationship;</li><li>the processing is in our legitimate interest as a reservation and event ticketing platform (basically, to maintain the security of our systems and to provide you with customer service, etc.)</li><li>the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations</li><li>you provided consent</li></ul><p><b>13. Transfer of Personal Data</b></p><p>As CellarPass provides services internationally, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside the country from which it was originally provided. This may be to Businesses using the Services, or to Third Parties that we work with who may be located jurisdictions outside the EEA, Switzerland and the IK which have no data protection laws or laws that are not as rigid compared with those in Europe. </p><p>Whenever we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we take legally required steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data. For Personal Data we receive, CellarPass has certified its compliance to the EU-U.S. and Swiss \u2013 U.S. Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from those countries. We have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield principals of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfers, Security, Data Integrity &amp; Purpose Limitation, Access and Resource, Enforcement &amp; Liability when processing Personal Data from EEA, Switzerland or the UK in the United States.</p><p><b>14.

If you cannot find what you are looking for in My Account page, please contact us by using the information provided in section 10 above.

There may be circumstances where we are not legally required to comply with your request because of the laws in your jurisdiction or because exemptions provided for in data protection legislation.</p><p>If you have questions or complaints on how we handle your Personal Data, please contact us as set forth in section 10 above. If you are not happy with how we have attempted to resolve your complaint, you may contact the relevant data protection authority.</p><p>CellarPass as a data controller and data processor</p><p>EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known at \u201cdata controllers\u201d) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as \u201cdata processors\u201d). If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, these should always be directed to the relevant organization since they are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data.</p><p>CellarPass may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances.</p><p>For example, if you generate a subscription account with us to manage your activities or events, CellarPass will be a data controller in respect to the Personal Data that you provide as part of your account. We will also be a data controller of the Personal Data that we have obtained about the use of the CellarPass Services, which could relate to Businesses or Guests. We use this to conduct research and analysis to help better understand and serve Users of the Services as well as to improve our platform and provide you with targeted recommendations about activities or events we think may be of interest to you.</p><p>However, if you register as a Guest, we will process your Personal Data to help administer that activity or event on behalf of the Business (for example: sending confirmation, promotional and feedback emails, processing payments, etc..) and to help the Business manage their event, understand the success of their event and event planning such as through event reports, guest lists, using analytics to determine effectiveness of various sales channels. In these scenarios, CellarPass just provides tools for Businesses; CellarPass does not decide what Personal Data to request on registration forms, nor is it responsible for the continued accuracy of any Personal Data provided. Questions you may have about your Personal Data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the Business as the data controller, not to CellarPass.</p><p><b>15.

If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, these should always be directed to the relevant organization since they are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data.CellarPass may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances.For example, if you generate a subscription account with us to manage your activities or events, CellarPass will be a data controller in respect to the Personal Data that you provide as part of your account. We will also be a data controller of the Personal Data that we have obtained about the use of the CellarPass Services, which could relate to Businesses or Guests. We use this to conduct research and analysis to help better understand and serve Users of the Services as well as to improve our platform and provide you with targeted recommendations about activities or events we think may be of interest to you.However, if you register as a Guest, we will process your Personal Data to help administer that activity or event on behalf of the Business (for example: sending confirmation, promotional and feedback emails, processing payments, etc..) and to help the Business manage their event, understand the success of their event and event planning such as through event reports, guest lists, using analytics to determine effectiveness of various sales channels. In these scenarios, CellarPass just provides tools for Businesses; CellarPass does not decide what Personal Data to request on registration forms, nor is it responsible for the continued accuracy of any Personal Data provided. Questions you may have about your Personal Data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the Business as the data controller, not to CellarPass.15.
