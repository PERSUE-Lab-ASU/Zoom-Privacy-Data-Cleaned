Cookies and Tracking Technologies</b><br>\nCookies, Pixels, and Similar Tracking Technologies Used: We and our authorized partners also collect information via cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, embedded scripts, session replay tools, SDKs, Local Storage such as HTML5 and Local Shared Objects (\u201cLSOs,\u201d also known as Flash cookies), or other data retrieval and tracking technologies (\u201cTracking Technologies\u201d), such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, your device\u2019s WiFi MAC address or Bluetooth MAC address, the date and time you access our Digital Properties, the pages you accessed while visiting our Digital Properties, and the Internet address from which you accessed our Digital Properties. Cookies are a type of technology that installs a small amount of information on a user\u2019s computer or other device when they visit a website. Cookies permit a website to, for example, recognize future visits using that computer or device. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time. We and our partners use these Tracking Technologies to ensure basic functionality of our Digital Properties; to remember user preferences (including your preferences regarding Tracking Technologies); maximize the performance of our Digital Properties and Services; provide you with offers that may be of interest to you; measure the effectiveness of our Digital Properties, marketing campaigns, and email communications; and to personalize online content. These Tracking Technologies may be used to track you over time and across devices, websites, and Services.\nAdditionally, we may employ, either directly or through third parties, tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are tiny, transparent graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to provide analytical information concerning the user experience as well as to support custom marketing activities for users of our Digital Properties. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages. Our Digital Properties may use tracking pixels to help us better manage content, such as by improving the user interface or improving our marketing programs or the marketing of our affiliates, business partners, and other third parties (including for interest-based advertising as described below). The Digital Properties may use information to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding user demographics, traffic patterns and purchases. We may also link tracking information with personal data.\nThird-Party Companies: To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content on our Digital Properties or through other communication channels. These companies may use Tracking Technologies as described in this Notice to gather information about you, which may include your precise location, your visits to the Digital Properties, and your visits elsewhere on the Internet. These companies also may use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising known as interest-based advertising, which may include sending you an ad on another online service after you have left our Digital Properties (i.e., retargeting).\nYour Choices: You may choose whether to receive some interest-based advertising. If located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, then essential cookies must always be used in order to provide the Services you have requested, However, you will be provided notice of our use of and subsequent processing of data collected through non-essential cookies (i.e. functional cookies, analytics cookies, targeting cookies and social media cookies) at the time when you first visit the MeetIQ website. If located in the European Economic Area, you may also more generally opt in to the use of cookies, by clicking here. The Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) and Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d) also provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and optout.networkadvertising.org. You can also visit http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA\u2019s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives. Further, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not necessarily be effective on your mobile device. DAA/NAI browser based opt-outs will not function or may no longer be effective if your browsers are configured to reject cookies, if you subsequently erase your cookies, or if you use a different device or web browser. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of these or any other third-parties\u2019 opt-out options or programs.\nDo Not Track: Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) preferences. Most of these features, when turned on, send signals to the website you are visiting that you do not wish to have information about your online searching and browsing activities collected and used. As there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from website browsers at this time. However, you may refuse or delete cookies. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our website functionality may be impaired or some of the advertising served to you may not be relevant for you anymore. If you change computers, devices, or browsers, or use multiple computers, devices, or browsers, and delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser. Please refer to your browser\u2019s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other Tracking Technologies. You can also find more information on managing cookies at All About Cookies \u2013 Manage Cookies.\nFor more information about the use of cookies on our Websites and how to manage your cookie settings, please read our Website Cookie Policy found here.\nSection 6 does not apply to in-product cookies used within our Services.

Likewise, we will retain your personal data during the applicable statute of limitation period for the establishment, exercise or defense of potential legal claims.\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need nor lawful legal ground to process your personal data, we will delete, anonymize, or aggregate it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If you would like to know more about retention periods applicable to your particular circumstance, you can contact us using details provided in Section 12 below.\n</p><p><b>8.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies\nCookies, Pixels, and Similar Tracking Technologies Used: We and our authorized partners also collect information via cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, embedded scripts, session replay tools, SDKs, Local Storage such as HTML5 and Local Shared Objects (\u201cLSOs,\u201d also known as Flash cookies), or other data retrieval and tracking technologies (\u201cTracking Technologies\u201d), such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, your device\u2019s WiFi MAC address or Bluetooth MAC address, the date and time you access our Digital Properties, the pages you accessed while visiting our Digital Properties, and the Internet address from which you accessed our Digital Properties. Cookies are a type of technology that installs a small amount of information on a user\u2019s computer or other device when they visit a website. Cookies permit a website to, for example, recognize future visits using that computer or device. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time. We and our partners use these Tracking Technologies to ensure basic functionality of our Digital Properties; to remember user preferences (including your preferences regarding Tracking Technologies); maximize the performance of our Digital Properties and Services; provide you with offers that may be of interest to you; measure the effectiveness of our Digital Properties, marketing campaigns, and email communications; and to personalize online content. These Tracking Technologies may be used to track you over time and across devices, websites, and Services.\nAdditionally, we may employ, either directly or through third parties, tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are tiny, transparent graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to provide analytical information concerning the user experience as well as to support custom marketing activities for users of our Digital Properties. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages. Our Digital Properties may use tracking pixels to help us better manage content, such as by improving the user interface or improving our marketing programs or the marketing of our affiliates, business partners, and other third parties (including for interest-based advertising as described below). The Digital Properties may use information to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding user demographics, traffic patterns and purchases. We may also link tracking information with personal data.\nThird-Party Companies: To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content on our Digital Properties or through other communication channels. These companies may use Tracking Technologies as described in this Notice to gather information about you, which may include your precise location, your visits to the Digital Properties, and your visits elsewhere on the Internet. These companies also may use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising known as interest-based advertising, which may include sending you an ad on another online service after you have left our Digital Properties (i.e., retargeting).\nYour Choices: You may choose whether to receive some interest-based advertising. If located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, then essential cookies must always be used in order to provide the Services you have requested, However, you will be provided notice of our use of and subsequent processing of data collected through non-essential cookies (i.e. functional cookies, analytics cookies, targeting cookies and social media cookies) at the time when you first visit the MeetIQ website. If located in the European Economic Area, you may also more generally opt in to the use of cookies, by clicking here. The Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) and Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d) also provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and optout.networkadvertising.org. You can also visit http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA\u2019s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives. Further, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not necessarily be effective on your mobile device. DAA/NAI browser based opt-outs will not function or may no longer be effective if your browsers are configured to reject cookies, if you subsequently erase your cookies, or if you use a different device or web browser. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of these or any other third-parties\u2019 opt-out options or programs.\nDo Not Track: Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) preferences. Most of these features, when turned on, send signals to the website you are visiting that you do not wish to have information about your online searching and browsing activities collected and used. As there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from website browsers at this time. However, you may refuse or delete cookies. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our website functionality may be impaired or some of the advertising served to you may not be relevant for you anymore. If you change computers, devices, or browsers, or use multiple computers, devices, or browsers, and delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser. Please refer to your browser\u2019s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other Tracking Technologies. You can also find more information on managing cookies at All About Cookies \u2013 Manage Cookies.\nFor more information about the use of cookies on our Websites and how to manage your cookie settings, please read our Website Cookie Policy found here.\nSection 6 does not apply to in-product cookies used within our Services.

Likewise, we will retain your personal data during the applicable statute of limitation period for the establishment, exercise or defense of potential legal claims.\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need nor lawful legal ground to process your personal data, we will delete, anonymize, or aggregate it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

To the extent applicable, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the other parts of the Notice and the terms of this Section 15, Section 15 shall govern and prevail with regard to the processing of EEA, Swiss and UK personal data.\nData Controller: The MeetIQ entity with which you have a primary relationship with (such as the entity that concluded sales/services/supply contract with you; the entity that has provided you with marketing and promotional materials and communications; the primary entity in the region where you access our Website) is the controller of personal data collected from individuals within the scope of this Notice.
