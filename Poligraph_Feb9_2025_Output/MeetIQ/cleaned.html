<br><br><b>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</b><br>
Cookies, Pixels, and Similar Tracking Technologies Used: We and our authorized partners also collect information via cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, embedded scripts, session replay tools, SDKs, Local Storage such as HTML5 and Local Shared Objects (“LSOs,” also known as Flash cookies), or other data retrieval and tracking technologies (“Tracking Technologies”), such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, your device’s WiFi MAC address or Bluetooth MAC address, the date and time you access our Digital Properties, the pages you accessed while visiting our Digital Properties, and the Internet address from which you accessed our Digital Properties. Cookies are a type of technology that installs a small amount of information on a user’s computer or other device when they visit a website. Cookies permit a website to, for example, recognize future visits using that computer or device. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time. We and our partners use these Tracking Technologies to ensure basic functionality of our Digital Properties; to remember user preferences (including your preferences regarding Tracking Technologies); maximize the performance of our Digital Properties and Services; provide you with offers that may be of interest to you; measure the effectiveness of our Digital Properties, marketing campaigns, and email communications; and to personalize online content. These Tracking Technologies may be used to track you over time and across devices, websites, and Services.
Additionally, we may employ, either directly or through third parties, tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are tiny, transparent graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to provide analytical information concerning the user experience as well as to support custom marketing activities for users of our Digital Properties. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages. Our Digital Properties may use tracking pixels to help us better manage content, such as by improving the user interface or improving our marketing programs or the marketing of our affiliates, business partners, and other third parties (including for interest-based advertising as described below). The Digital Properties may use information to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding user demographics, traffic patterns and purchases. We may also link tracking information with personal data.
Third-Party Companies: To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content on our Digital Properties or through other communication channels. These companies may use Tracking Technologies as described in this Notice to gather information about you, which may include your precise location, your visits to the Digital Properties, and your visits elsewhere on the Internet. These companies also may use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising known as interest-based advertising, which may include sending you an ad on another online service after you have left our Digital Properties (i.e., retargeting).
Your Choices: You may choose whether to receive some interest-based advertising. If located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, then essential cookies must always be used in order to provide the Services you have requested, However, you will be provided notice of our use of and subsequent processing of data collected through non-essential cookies (i.e. functional cookies, analytics cookies, targeting cookies and social media cookies) at the time when you first visit the MeetIQ website. If located in the European Economic Area, you may also more generally opt in to the use of cookies, by clicking here. The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) also provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and optout.networkadvertising.org. You can also visit http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives. Further, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not necessarily be effective on your mobile device. DAA/NAI browser based opt-outs will not function or may no longer be effective if your browsers are configured to reject cookies, if you subsequently erase your cookies, or if you use a different device or web browser. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of these or any other third-parties’ opt-out options or programs.
Do Not Track: Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. Most of these features, when turned on, send signals to the website you are visiting that you do not wish to have information about your online searching and browsing activities collected and used. As there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from website browsers at this time. However, you may refuse or delete cookies. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our website functionality may be impaired or some of the advertising served to you may not be relevant for you anymore. If you change computers, devices, or browsers, or use multiple computers, devices, or browsers, and delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other Tracking Technologies. You can also find more information on managing cookies at All About Cookies – Manage Cookies.
For more information about the use of cookies on our Websites and how to manage your cookie settings, please read our Website Cookie Policy found here.
Section 6 does not apply to in-product cookies used within our Services. Our Product Cookie Policy can be found here.
<br><br><b>7. Security and Retention</b><br>
We maintain reasonable security procedures and technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, disclosure, alteration, or use.

Once you or your company has terminated the contractual relationship with us or otherwise ended your relationship with us, we may retain your personal data in our systems and records in order to: ensure adequate fulfillment of surviving provisions in terminated contracts, or for other legitimate business purposes, such as in order to evidence our business practices and contractual obligations, to provide you with information about our products and services, or to comply with the applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. Likewise, we will retain your personal data during the applicable statute of limitation period for the establishment, exercise or defense of potential legal claims.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need nor lawful legal ground to process your personal data, we will delete, anonymize, or aggregate it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If you would like to know more about retention periods applicable to your particular circumstance, you can contact us using details provided in Section 12 below.
<br><br><b>8. User Research Participation</b><br>
We collect your information when you participate in a user research project, and we will only use the information for the project you are participating in and to reach out to you about future research opportunities. We will retain your information for as long as we have a legitimate purpose for doing so, and process your information in accordance with this Notice.
<br><br><b>9. Children’s Privacy</b><br>
Our Websites and Services are not directed to children under the age of 16 and we do not knowingly collect online personal data directly from children. If you are a parent or guardian of a minor child and believe that the child has disclosed online personal data to us, please contact privacy@meetiq.io.

<br><br><b>15. Supplemental Information for the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK</b><br>
The following terms supplement the Notice with respect to our processing of European Economic Area (i.e., European Union Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), Swiss, and UK personal data. To the extent applicable, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the other parts of the Notice and the terms of this Section 15, Section 15 shall govern and prevail with regard to the processing of EEA, Swiss and UK personal data.
Data Controller: The MeetIQ entity with which you have a primary relationship with (such as the entity that concluded sales/services/supply contract with you; the entity that has provided you with marketing and promotional materials and communications; the primary entity in the region where you access our Website) is the controller of personal data collected from individuals within the scope of this Notice. In the majority of cases, this will be MeetIQ LLC, unless we specifically inform you otherwise. On some occasions, more than one MeetIQ entity may process your personal data as independent controllers. If you have any questions about controllership, please contact us (see Section 12 for contact information).
Legal bases for processing: We rely on the following legal grounds for the collection, processing, and use of your personal data:
The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract. This includes instances when we need to enable interactions between you and us and to provide our services to you; when we need to facilitate our business relationship with you or companies acting as our investors, suppliers and other business partners; and when we conclude and fulfill our part of the contract with our customers.
The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal or statutory obligation to which we are subject. This includes instances when we are required by various business laws to carry out various compliance checks (such as export controls) related to our customers, investors, suppliers, and other business partners. It may also include various local tax and accountancy compliance obligations we have to comply with due to the operation of our business.
The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. This includes instances where we process your personal data for our own internal business-improvement purposes, certain survey and questionnaires we may carry out, and our marketing activities (for example by sending you digital direct marketing related to similar products/services we have provided to you), unless consent is required under applicable laws. We may also provide some of the auxiliary support to our services based on our legitimate business interest to do so, even though we are not required to do so under our contracts, including through various digital communication and other tools we provide in the course of our business relationship with you.
Where you provided us with your consent to the processing of your data for one or more specific purposes. This includes digital direct marketing communications where your consent is required by law or in other instances where we asked for your consent in order to collect and process your personal data (we will inform you at each such occasion).
The processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health. This may include our legitimate interests and legal obligations in the collection and processing of health data from office visitors or event attendees in the context of a pandemic or related health threatening scenarios in order to protect individuals against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care;
The processing is necessary for our legitimate interests in the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.
