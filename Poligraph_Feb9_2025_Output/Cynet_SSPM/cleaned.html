<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect Personal Information in accordance with your use, including your full name, e-mail and/or physical addresses, phone number, contact information, occupation and industry or other details to provide you with the Services you requested. When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, please read our <a href="https://www.cynet.com/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>.</span></p>

</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Improvement of our Website and Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the purposes of Fraud Detection, we collect the following information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screen requests for potential risk or fraud;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Website (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Marketing and Promotional Purposes&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also use or disclose the above mentioned PII when in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services. We also use the Device Information that we collect in online advertising and retargeting marketing campaigns.</span></p>
<p><b>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynet stores the PII if it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which the information has been collected. This means that Cynet deletes your Personal Information when such information is no longer necessary. Statistics and analysis which have been anonymised may be saved thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We only provide articles and information. We never ask for credit card numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use regular Malware Scanning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers. However, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the internet and that there is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of your PII or other content you transmit using the Services, and you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to exercise discretion regarding the PII you choose to disclose.</span></p>

<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not market to children under the age of 13 years old.</span></p>
<p><b>FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur we will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only those individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</span></p>
<p><b>CAN SPAM Act</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect your email address in order to:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at: info@cynet.com and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</span></p>
