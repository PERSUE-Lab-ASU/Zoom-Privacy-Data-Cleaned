This Data Privacy Policy (hereinafter \u201cthe Policy\u201d or \u201cthis Policy\u201d) outlines how Vuzix will handle personal data in compliance with these regulations.</p>\n<p>Vuzix keeps this Policy under regular review. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will provide notice of such changes by posting the revised policy on the Vuzix website (<a href=\"https://www.vuzix.com/pages/privacy-policy\"><span>here</span></a>), and where appropriate, by other means.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. SCOPE</strong></p><p>This Policy applies to all personal data collected, processed, and stored by Vuzix in relation to our customers, employees, and any other individuals whose personal data or personal information we may collect in the course of regular business activities, including but not limited to information collected through<span>&nbsp; </span>a visitor\u2019s use of one or more of our websites, e.g., (<a href=\"https://www.vuzix.com/\"><span>https://www.vuzix.com/</span></a>), (<a href=\"https://vuzix.asia/\"><span>https://vuzix.asia/</span></a>), (<a href=\"https://vuzix.uk/\"><span>https://vuzix.uk/</span></a>), (<a href=\"https://www.vuzix.eu/\"><span>https://www.vuzix.eu/</span></a>), (<a href=\"https://www.vuzixjapan.com/\"><span>https://www.vuzixjapan.com/</span></a>), (<a href=\"https://ir.vuzix.com/\"><span>https://ir.vuzix.com/</span></a>), and (<a href=\"https://apps.vuzix.com/\"><span>https://apps.vuzix.com/</span></a>) referred to collectively herein as \u201cour Website(s)\u201d or \u201cthe Website(s)\u201d, any information that is accessed by any application that Vuzix makes available on it\u2019s App Store, and any information we or our employees collect in person or over the telephone.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Our Website(s) and any available Apps may contain links to websites operated by others. The pertinent provisions of this Policy only apply to information collected by our Website(s). Privacy policies for these third-party sites, Apps, and services may be different from this Policy. Access to these third-party sites , Apps, and services is undertaken at the visitor\u2019s own risk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p><p>The information we collect generally falls into the following two categories: \"Personal Information\" and \"Non-Personally Identifiable Information.\" Personal Information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are (for example, your name, job title, company, physical mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers and, if applicable, financial information such as your credit card information). Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. If we do combine Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p>\n<p>In general, we collect your Personal Information when you voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you register with us, place an order for products or services, or submit your information to us in one of our online web-forms. We also collect information when you voluntarily complete customer surveys, provide feedback, and participate in competitions.</p>\n<p>Vuzix will only collect, process, and store Personal Information if there is a lawful basis for doing so. These may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span></span>Consent: you have given clear consent for your Personal Information to be processed for a specific purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span></span>Contractual necessity: The processing of Personal Information is necessary for the performance of a contract with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span></span>Legal obligation: The processing of Personal Information is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span></span>Vital interests: The processing of Personal Information is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another person.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span></span>Legitimate interests: The processing of Personal Information is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by Vuzix or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The principles set forth in this Policy apply equally to Vuzix-authored applications or \u201cApps\u201d that are made available on our App Store. A \u201cVuzix-authored\u201d App means an App that was written and developed substantially by Vuzix employees and identified as a Vuzix property in associated documentation. For Vuzix-authored Apps, in general, we do not collect or store any Personal Identifiable Information. In the rare circumstances that a Vuzix-authorized App may have access to Personal Identifiable Information, Vuzix will indicate the uses and associated rights that you have in any associated documentation or description of the App on our App store. Third parties may also publish or otherwise make available one or more Apps via the Vuzix App store. For Apps that third parties create, we encourage you to read any documentation provided by said third party when downloading and using their Apps for privacy policy information.</p>\n<p>Location data may be obtained from a user\u2019s phone by the Vuzix Companion App. The user must enable location services within the Vuzix Companion App and the phone operating system (OS). If enabled by both the Vuzix Companion App and the phone OS, location data is forwarded to Vuzix\u2019 smart glasses from the phone. The Vuzix Companion App does not directly send location data to any website or third-party and does not log the location data. Location data, once shared by the phone to the smart glasses may be shared to any application running on the smart glasses including third-party applications. The shared location data can be controlled, on a per-application basis, by the user from within the smart glasses operating systems\u2019 settings menu.</p>\n<p>Similarly, location data may be obtained from a user\u2019s phone by the Vuzix Connect App. Location data obtained by the Vuzix Connect App is only used while actively engaged in pertinent activity where location is required by the app, e.g., fitness, navigation, etc. Additionally, this location data is only used within the Vuzix Connect App and not sent to or logged by third-parties.</p>\n<p>In addition, our Website(s) may use \"cookies\" to gather Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
