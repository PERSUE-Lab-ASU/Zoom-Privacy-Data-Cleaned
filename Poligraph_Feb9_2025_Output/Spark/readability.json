You can choose not to provide certain information or disable and prevent us from collecting, storing, and processing it by changing your account\u2019s settings (e.g., by revoking consent or opt-out checkboxes), via our email address <a href=\"mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com\">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a> or by any means of communication available for you. Please be aware that you may not be able to enjoy some of Spark\u2019s features in such a case.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"controllerdetails\">Controller Details</h2>\n\n<p>Any organization that collects and processes data can play different roles depending on particular data processing operation. For example, Spark plays different roles depending on the feature you use. In this Section, we explain how Spark meets the role requirements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"controller\">Controller</h3>\n\n<p>We are the Controller of the personal data for the Users (Free), Users (Premium), Teams, Organizations, and Enterprises (representatives of Organizations or Enterprises) from the moment of the User\u2019s consent to the <a href=\"https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/terms\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This means we determine the amount, purpose, and means of personal data processing when you use the App.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"processor\">Processor</h3>\n\n<p>Under the applicable privacy protection rules, we can also act as the data processor depending on the particular data protection operation. This is the case where Spark provides a self-help tool, product, or feature and does not use personal data without the user\u2019s instruction. For example, Spark does not use the email addresses of the email senders for Spark\u2019s marketing activities, but only to enable the User to receive and send emails via Spark Service.</p>\n\n<p>We are processing data on behalf of Organizations or Enterprises (based on the agreed instructions provided in the Data Processing Agreement; you may request a copy of our Data Processing Agreement at <a href=\"mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com\">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a>).</p>\n\n<div>\n\t<p><strong>Example</strong>: Company A purchased 15 licenses for employees. The \u0421ontroller of the employees\u2019 data is Company A, while we are the processor concerning this processing activity (namely, where we provide them with Spark services at the expense of Company A). As a data processor, Spark does not use such data (e.g., email addresses of third parties) for our own purposes, for example, for cold calls marketing.\n\t</p><p>\n\tAs a result, we are processors for all personal data of Users, employees, or contractors of the three categories: the Organization, the Enterprise, and the User (Free or Premium).\n</p></div>\n\n<p>For more details about our role as a Controller and a personal data Processor, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com\">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a>.

Sometimes, we will write emails to our registered Users to inform them of our new features and products.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"personaldata\">Personal Data in Spark: What We Collect</h2>\n\n<p>This section explains our approach and practices for processing personal data at different features in the App.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"beforestart\">Before we start</h3>\n\n<p>We process two categories of data: technical and personal data you provide to us. Some of it can be seen on the client-side (interface), and some are processed on the backend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Client-Side</strong> is the part of the App displayed or takes place on the users\u2019 devices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backend</strong> is an invisible crucial part of the App where algorithms operate on the variables and data points. In the majority of cases, it is crucial to process such data in order to provide our services to you. For example, we keep backend data taking into account organizational and technical measures to ensure the security of your data.</p>\n\n<p>As defined, you may belong to one of the categories of Users:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Free User (Free)</li>\n\t<li>Paying User (Premium)</li>\n\t<li>Team</li>\n\t<li>Organization</li>\n\t<li>Enterprise</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We collect your personal data according to this Privacy Policy when you use the App. When you use our Website, your personal data is processed in accordance with the Website\u2019s <a href=\"https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-web\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a>. Some of the data the App collects automatically, such as the country the App is used in: we get this data based on the IP address or from the App Store (we receive this information in a generalized form). Generally, all the data provided to us can either be linked to you or not (i.e., anonymized data).</p>\n\n<p>We either create new personal data items or receive them from you. For example,</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>data we create and assign</strong> will include userID, subscription expiration date, appToken, and</li>\n\t<li><strong>data we collect from you or the third parties on your behalf</strong> would include payment history, requests, app usage data, account data, technical data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"dataprocessed\">Data Processed</h3>\n\n<p>We process some personal data for purely business purposes: to enable you to use our services, to notify you of our new products and features, to invite you to participate in our special programs and offers and beta testing programs, and to use parts of your data (usually pseudonymized) to monitor the trends and develop our product and business. We collect certain information about you when you provide it directly to us or use our App and Service. We only collect the information necessary to provide you with our services.</p>\n\n<p>Unless we specify a particular legal basis, we process your personal data based on the contract (our <a href=\"https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/terms\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>) (Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR: performance of contract).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Email address</strong>: As an email client, the core functionality of our Product is based on providing you with the ability to manage your email. For this reason, Spark services access your email account when you start using the App. Your email address is a unique identifier of you as a User within our system and allows us to secure your data. Your email address will also be used as a primary means of communication for us on anything related to changes to the App and Service, such as Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Beta Tester Agreement or core functionality of our App or Service. We may also use your email to sync your data with your third-party accounts (if you request us to do so in the App), or occasionally contact you for marketing purposes (it will be in our legitimate interests to do so). You will always have a chance to opt-out of such sync or any marketing communications for similar products and/or services anytime. Please note that your email is safe with us, and we do not use it for profiling or targeting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OAuth login or mail server credentials</strong>: Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages and other communication. Without such access, our Product will not be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience. In order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as \u201csend later\u201d, \u201csync between devices\u201d and where allowed by Apple \u2013 \u201cpush notifications\u201d we use Spark Services. Without using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Billing data</strong>. We may need to process your personal data to ensure the smooth operation of your subscription plan and comply with the applicable laws. We do not have access to your sensitive payment data (as the payment processor will only collect your personal data to process the payment), but we may store your payment processor id, payment status, and information about your subscription terms (such as type and duration).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Identity of a team you join</strong>: In order to make team collaboration within Spark possible, we allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service. It allows you to share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts, private discussions, or create links to a specific email message. Team identity is necessary to associate you with that specific team as well as secure your information from people who are not a part of your team. Our system creates a record about the team only when you create one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Email content while using Spark Services</strong>: We may retain your email (at your request) when you use the \u201cSend later\u201d feature - until the email is sent, or create links to specific emails - until you stop sharing of the email. This information is stored on our secure servers in order to make Services available to you.</p><p>We also allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service. It allows you to have a secure space to share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts and have private discussions. To provide you with enhanced text editing functions and real-time collaboration features for the team, we link shared email drafts to the teamID. Such draft is processed on our secure servers to make Services available to you.&nbsp;</p><p>We store the snapshot of the email draft (final text)as long as the team exists or until you delete the draft.</p><p>Please note that you are solely responsible for sharing your draft content (that may include personal data) with third parties, including team members.</p>\n<p><strong>Input and output:</strong> When using Spark +AI, you can provide input (email text and prompt) for processing and receive generated output. We do not retain the content of your emails or prompts but only transmit them to the AI provider for processing. They do not use your data for model training and keep it no longer than 30 days. Read more about Spark +AI and its data processing practices in the \u2018<a href=\"#azureopenaidata\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI Providers Data</a>\u2019 section.</p>\n<p><strong>Email samples and writing style description:</strong> When you activate \u2018My Writing Style\u2019, we process your recently sent emails to analyze their length and other criteria and select appropriate samples (\u2018samples\u2019). Further, we pass the selected samples to the AI provider for analyzing your writing style and getting the textual description of it. Your emails are analysed for the samples and writing style description only once unless you use the \u2018Rescan email samples\u2019 option in the \u2018Settings\u2019, change the samples manually, or delete them and reactivate the feature.</p>\n<p>The samples are stored in your account as settings of the feature. You can review the samples in the \u2018Settings\u2019 and manually replace them with other examples if you wish. We also store the samples and your writing style description in our backend.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To help you generate email with Spark +AI further, we will pass only your writing style description along with each request to the AI provider.</p>\n<p>Spark will store the samples and your writing style description until you delete your account or until you delete all samples manually. Please note that when you delete all samples we automatically delete the writing style description.</p>\n<p>Read more about \u2018My writing style\u2019 in the \u2018<a href=\"#azureopenaidata\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI Providers Data</a>\u2019 section.</p>\n<p><strong>+AI Meeting Notes and Summaries</strong>. When you activate the \u2018+AI Meeting Notes\u2019 feature, we process several types of data. This includes the audio stream, which is transcribed, in certain cases the video stream to extract the audio, the conversation transcript generated by a third-party AI provider, and user information such as participant names, User Spark ID, Team identity, subscription type, email addresses, and display names. We also handle a summary of the transcript created by a third-party AI provider, event details from Spark Calendar (including the event name, participants, and timeframe), your notes and any modifications made to the original output, as well as analytics data about feature usage, such as feedback, transcript length, and usage statistics. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can edit, copy, and share the transcript and/or summary using a link. These transcripts and summaries will remain in your Spark Account for as long as your account is active or until you choose to delete them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spark does not store the audio stream of the conversation unless you choose to share one with us for troubleshooting purposes. The AI provider may retain the audio stream for up to thirty (30) days as part of its abuse and misuse monitoring processes. After this period, the audio is deleted unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>\n<p>Additionally, neither Spark nor the AI providers use the data processed through this feature for large language model (LLM) training.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more details on how the \u2018+AI Meeting Notes\u2019 feature operates, please refer to the \u2018<a href=\"#azureopenaidata\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI Providers Data</a>\u2019 section.</p>\n<p><strong>IP address and settings</strong>: The core functionality of our Product is based on an Internet connection, that is why our App and Service will not properly function without it. Your IP address is a unique identifier that lets you connect to the Internet, and our service will log connections for security and troubleshooting purposes. We also retain information about your settings so you may ensure the synchronization of your choices and experience between your devices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>APNS device token (Apple Push Notification Service)</strong>: Push notifications allow you to get immediate updates about new emails or private team comments in your email inbox. You\u2019re free to enable or disable them during the initial App setup or later using your device\u2019s system preferences.</p>\n\n<p><strong>App token assigned by us</strong>: This token allows us to identify your device in our system and troubleshoot potential issues you might experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Device, App version, iOS version information</strong>: We need to have this information so the App functions properly on your specific device.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statistical information with regards to App usage</strong>: In order to better understand general app usage patterns and improve the Product and its user experience, Spark collects general statistical information about the usage of the Product. Collecting such data helps us optimize the App in future updates, and such usage does not affect your rights and freedoms and does not disclose any personal data of yourself or your contacts. You may read Amplitude\u2019s <a href=\"https://amplitude.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Policy</a> to learn more about their processing of personal data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recently accessed email messages, collaboration threads, and shared inboxes</strong>: We need this information to provide Spark Services to you and your teammates, such as private discussions around email, shared drafts, shared email conversations, and shared inboxes. By collecting and storing this data, we are able to present message discussion threads through your Spark App and provide a better communication experience with your team.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some of your email contacts</strong>: Spark Smart Notifications will send you push notifications only for important messages from real people. To block push notifications for promotional newsletters and automatic emails, we need to keep the \u201cwhitelist\u201d of senders for push notifications. We\u2019ll sync this \u201cwhitelist\u201d of contacts to our server to enable Smart Notifications. If you decide not to use Smart Notifications, we will never sync your email contacts.</p>\n<p><strong>Pixel data and link clicks information</strong>. We may use email and other marketing software to collect metrics on our marketing campaigns. Usually, pixels help their providers to collect technical data, such as the time when the image was loaded and the IP address, etc. For example, we may use the Braze service to see email opening rate, and then use this opening rate to enhance our emails and send our users a more helpful material or relevant offer in the future. Braze can also register that the link in the email was clicked on. You may disable pixels in your email service provider\u2019s settings and avoid opening links, if you don\u2019t want to participate in the collection of this statistics. In Spark, you should go to the \u201cGeneral\u201d section of Settings page to disable loading the pixels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Logs</strong>: Some information about your use of the Spark Mail services can be stored either by us or by your device. When we collect this information on our servers, we do so to prevent fraud and potential unauthorized access to your personal information, ensuring the technical availability and security of the App. The server that hosts the App may record requests your device makes to the server, the details on the device and browser you use, your IP address, date and time of access, city and country, operating system, browser type, mobile network information. This data is used only for technical purposes \u2013 that is, to ensure the proper functioning and security of the App,to investigate possible security incidents, and to troubleshoot bugs and problems with the App reported by you. If you report an issue that prevents you from enjoying Spark, we may need the log data that is contained on your device to investigate the issue and troubleshoot. As we cannot obtain those logs without you sending them to us, we will rely on your consent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Customer Support communication</strong>: We process and store email or support chat communication, including attachments and information you voluntarily decide to share with us for troubleshooting purposes whenever you communicate with our support team.</p>\n<p>To enhance your experience, we collect analytics on customer support requests (excluding any attachments) to understand the most frequent inquiries and identify areas for improvement within the App. This analysis is conducted internally within Spark using secure, in-house technologies, including pre-trained machine learning models. Rest assured, we do not use your personal data to test or train these models.</p>\n<p><strong>Request a feature</strong>: When you contact us via the \u201cRequest a feature\u201d form with your proposal for our product enhancement, we process your email address, type of device, your name (if you\u2019re willing to share it), and any other additional information you may provide in the form. We process this data based on your consent. We automatically collect some technical information (platform, app version, date of installation, Spark ID and Braze ID) for a detailed analysis of your proposal.

We may switch between the AI providers to provide a more secure and faster service, to run new versions of models, or for other commercially justifiable reasons. The switch between AI providers is manual, and we retain full control over it.</p>\n<p>Please note that, in the event of a switch between AI Providers, the data processing rules and interaction protocols will remain the same as described below. We will not provide notification about such switches.</p>\n<p><strong>Applicability</strong>. This section of the Privacy Policy applies only to our Premium Users of Spark 3 who use the Spark +AI feature or Users who get access to it during the Trial period. By default, Spark +AI is switched off: you must opt in to enable the Spark +AI feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Permissions</strong>. We use the AI Providers' services and Spark +AI based on your consent. By using Spark +AI, you consent to the processing of your personal data by us as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the use of the AI Providers' services, you should not switch on the Spark +AI feature that incorporates it. If you decide to withdraw your consent, you must switch off the Spark +AI feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Generation of Spark +AI data</strong>. Spark +AI helps you generate and edit email drafts. Spark +AI does not send emails on your behalf. You have full control over the generated content at all times, and you can review and edit it any time before sending.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Spark +AI data</strong>. Spark +AI is designed to protect your private data we obtain from you or about you. We do not store the contents of your emails and your requests for the Spark +AI feature. If you choose to use the Spark +AI feature, we will only transfer the textual context of your email to Microsoft to process your request and generate or edit email text based on that and additional context.</p>\n<p><strong>Model training</strong>. We do not use your private data to train Microsoft, OpenAI or any other machine learning model when you use the Spark +AI feature. Any information, including personal data, that you furnish while using the Spark +AI feature will be shared with the AI Providers solely for the purpose of functioning of the Spark +AI feature. We do not permit the AI Providers to use your personal data for any other purpose except for debugging in the event of a failure and to monitor the potential misuse or abuse of their services. According to the AI Providers' documentation, they do not use customer data to train, retrain, or improve the base models.</p>\n<p><strong>Security of Spark +AI data</strong>. Your email content and requests you make to Spark +AI are private and encrypted in accordance with our standard privacy and information security practices. We implement the latest commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect your personal data both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained in Spark, or third party services.</p>\n<p><strong>Input and Output</strong>.

When you use Spark +AI, Input and Output are your customer data (\u201c<strong>Customer Data</strong>\u201d). You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of your Customer Data.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2018My Writing Style\u2019 feature</strong>. This is an AI-powered feature based on profiling. Profiling refers to the automated processing of personal data to assess specific aspects of a person. In this case, profiling does not result in any legal implications for you, nor does it significantly impact you in a similar manner. It analyzes a selection of your recently sent emails (referred to as \u2018samples\u2019) to learn and mimic your writing style. Subsequently, it applies your writing style and tone of voice to all new Spark +AI-generated email drafts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By default, the feature is turned off. You can activate or deactivate it within the \u2018Writing Assistant\u2019 of the \u2018Spark+ AI\u2019 section in your account settings.</p>\n<p>When you turn on the feature, we automatically select samples that meet the length and other criteria from your recently sent emails and pass such samples to the AI provider to get the description of your writing style. The AI Provider will not have access to your other emails. Further, the description of your style will be sent to the AI provider along with each request when you draft new emails with Spark +AI.</p>\n<p>Read more about samples, their review, and deletion in the \u2018Email samples\u2019 subsection of \u2018<a href=\"#dataprocessed\">Data Processed</a>.\u2019</p>\n<p><strong>\u2018+AI Meeting Notes\u2019 feature</strong>. This tool provides AI-powered audio transcription and summarization, allowing you to generate meeting transcripts and AI-driven summaries.

You can activate it by selecting \u201cStart transcription\u201d in the pop-up notification, or \u201cStart Ad-Hoc Meeting\u201d in the Calendar Agenda pop up, or from menus within the App. After you turn on this feature, please ensure that you inform the meeting participants that you are making a meeting transcription via Spark. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The feature captures an audio stream on your device with the help of the on-device AI model. Once the meeting ends or you finish the transcription, the audio stream is automatically sent to the third-party AI provider for obtaining a transcription, which is further summarized. The transcription and summary are saved in your Spark account.</p>\n<p>Read more about transcripts and summary, and their deletion in the \u2018Meeting Notes and Summaries\u2019 subsection of \u2018<a href=\"#dataprocessed\">Data Processed</a>.\u2019<br></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"agelimitation\">Age Limitation</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Please pay attention</strong>.

The data is stored in the USA by default, but we may need to process your personal data in another country. We also share some data with our service providers in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The European Commission has recognised the United States (commercial organisations participating in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework) as providing adequate protection. In particular, Google LLC and its wholly-owned US subsidiaries (unless explicitly excluded), have certified that they adhere to the DPF Principles.</p>\n\n<p>There is no adequate decision by the European Commission regarding Ukraine. Therefore, we have prepared a data processing agreement based on the standards of the Standard Contractual Clauses and carried out the legislation assessments for data protection during transfer and storage in third countries under the GDPR, such as Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>You can read detailed information on measures we take to protect your personal data <a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and, if signed, in our Data Processing Agreement with you.

We follow ISO 27001 Standard to put all security controls in place as a basis.</p>\n\n<p>To be more specific, to protect your personal data, we use HTTPS and encryption, divided group and individual access (where appropriate), alarm systems, corporate VPN, written approved internal policies (like password policy and physical access policy).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, we systematically monitor our technologies\u2019 state of the art and never forget about the backups. All our contractors are under contractual obligations which are compliant with the GDPR requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Here you can find information about the steps we mentioned above:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trainedteam\">Trained team</h3>\n\n<p>Our team is competent in the matter of your personal data protection. Company regularly performs training in order to ensure that every team member has enough knowledge to keep your data safe and protect it in accordance with the best practices prescribed by European and U.S. laws on data protection.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"httpsencryption\">HTTPS and encryption</h3>\n\n<p>We ensure that all transmission is secured with HTTPS so that no one else can access your data. Your email and account credentials are stored on secure cloud-based servers using symmetric and asymmetric encryption: private and public keys.</p>\n\n<p>We currently use Google (\"<strong>Hosting providers</strong>\"). These Hosting providers have various international security certificates that ensure your data safety.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>App Center.

You can read more on the security measures via <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/security\" target=\"_blank\">the link</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"securitymeasuresdetailed\">Security measures (detailed explanation):</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. Physical access control: group access and alarm system</strong></p>\n\n<p>We secure access to the premises via ID readers, so only authorized persons have access to them. The ID cards can be blocked individually; access is also logged.</p>\n\n<p>An alarm system is installed on the premises, preventing infiltration by unauthorized persons. The alarm system is linked to a locking mechanism for the doors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. System access control: individual access and password policy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each employee has access to the systems/services only via their employee access. The access rights involved are limited to the responsibilities of the respective employee and/or team.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Password policy</strong>. We regulate access to our systems via password procedures and the use of SSH keys of at least 4096 bits in length. The SSH keys strengthen the productive systems against attacks that target weak passwords, as password-based access to the relevant systems is disabled.</p>\n\n<p>We have, in addition, a regulation for the creation of passwords. This guarantees higher security also for systems that offer password-based access.</p>\n\n<p>Passwords must meet specific requirements. It must be at least:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>12 characters long</li>\n\t<li>1 letter in upper-case</li>\n\t<li>1 letter in lower-case</li>\n\t<li>1 number</li>\n\t<li>1 special symbol</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our systems are protected by firewalls that reject all incoming connections by default. Only connection types defined by exception are accepted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Data access control: monitoring and physical access policy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>All servers and services are subject to continuous monitoring. This includes the logging of personal access in the user interface.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the proximity of the employees, a visual inspection is possible at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Locking and/or logging off when leaving work is prescribed and practiced.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Transfer control: contractual obligations and corporate VPN</strong></p>\n\n<p>Before transferring any data, we specify organizational and security requirements in Data Processing and Data Transfer Agreements (if applicable). These agreements are obligatory for every Enterprise and us as the Controller.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the handling of local data storage devices, e.g., USB sticks, is regulated via agreements.</p>\n\n<p>Access to the systems outside the company network is possible only via secure VPN access.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Input control: general restriction</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our employees do not work directly at the database level but instead, use applications to access the data.</p>\n\n<p>IT employees access the system via individual access and use a common login.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Availability control: backups and division</strong></p>\n\n<p>We ensure the availability of data in several ways. For example, there is a regular backup of the entire system. This can be used if the other availability measures fail.</p>\n\n<p>Critical services are operated redundantly in multiple data centers and controlled by a high-availability system.</p>\n\n<p>Our workstations are also protected with the usual measures. For example, virus scanners are installed, and laptops are encrypted.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to specify that we use MDM-solution to protect employee devices with security settings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Separation control: limited access.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We use logically separate databases to prevent unauthorized persons from accidentally reading data with limited access.</p>\n\n<p>Access to the data is also restricted because employees use services (applications) that control access.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"privacyrights\">Privacy Rights</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"euprivacyrights\">EU privacy rights</h3>\n\n<p>You, as subjects of personal data, have the following rights:</p>\n\n<div>\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<th>Right</th>\n\t\t\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td>Right to access</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>You can request an explanation of the processing of your personal data.</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td>Right to rectification</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>You can change the information if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td>Right to erasure</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>You can send us a request to delete your personal data from our systems.</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td>Right to data portability</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>You can request all the data that you provided to us, as well as request to transfer data to another Controller.</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td>Right to object</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>You can object to the processing of your data.</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td>Right to restriction</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>You may partially or wholly prohibit us from processing your personal data.</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td>Right to withdraw consent</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>You can withdraw your consent at any time.</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td>Right to lodge a complaint</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>If your request is not satisfied, you can file a complaint to the regulatory body.</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t</tbody>\n\t</table>\n</div>\n\n<p>To exercise your rights, write us an email at <a href=\"mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com\">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a>.

The method used needs to consider how customers normally interact with the Controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the Controller to authenticate the requests.</p>\n\n<p>Controllers are prohibited from requiring a customer to create a new account to exercise their customer rights but may require a customer to use an existing account.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Response time</strong>. Controllers are required to respond to customer requests within forty-five (45) days. This period may be extended once by forty-five (45) additional days if certain requirements are met.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No charge for the information</strong>.

DOPPA regulates operators only as far as they provide services or platforms that are 'targeted or intended to reach an audience composed predominantly of children'. However, this does not include services or platforms that merely refer or link to another service or platform directed at children.</p>\n\n<p>Operators can also be liable under DOPPA if, despite not directing their services or platforms to children, they have actual knowledge that children are accessing the services or platforms. In such an event, an operator cannot knowingly use, disclose, or compile that child\u2019s personal information, nor can an operator allow another to do the same. An operator that provides a covered service or platform cannot advertise or market content inappropriate for children. In this regard, DOPPA provides an enumerated list of prohibited content, including alcohol, tobacco, firearms, fireworks, tanning equipment and facilities, lotteries and gambling, tattoos, drug paraphernalia, and pornography. You should note that an operator need not monitor the preceding if it uses an advertising service and ensures that it complies with DOPPA.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do-not-track requests</strong>. Delaware residents visiting our websites may request that we do not automatically gather and track information about their online browsing movements across the Internet. Such requests are typically made through web browser settings that control signals or other mechanisms that provide customers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal data about an individual customer's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We currently cannot honor these requests. We may modify this Policy as our abilities change.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"regionspecific-nevada\">Nevada Legislation</h3>\n\n<p>For residents of Nevada, we provide more information about the relevant legislation and your privacy rights granted by the Nevada privacy law \u200b\u200bSenate Bill 220.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Opt-Out of the sale</strong>.

Please be aware that you may not be able to enjoy some of Spark\u2019s features in such a case.\n\nController Details\n\nAny organization that collects and processes data can play different roles depending on particular data processing operation. For example, Spark plays different roles depending on the feature you use. In this Section, we explain how Spark meets the role requirements.\n\nController\n\nWe are the Controller of the personal data for the Users (Free), Users (Premium), Teams, Organizations, and Enterprises (representatives of Organizations or Enterprises) from the moment of the User\u2019s consent to the Terms of Service.\n\nThis means we determine the amount, purpose, and means of personal data processing when you use the App.\n\nProcessor\n\nUnder the applicable privacy protection rules, we can also act as the data processor depending on the particular data protection operation. This is the case where Spark provides a self-help tool, product, or feature and does not use personal data without the user\u2019s instruction. For example, Spark does not use the email addresses of the email senders for Spark\u2019s marketing activities, but only to enable the User to receive and send emails via Spark Service.\n\nWe are processing data on behalf of Organizations or Enterprises (based on the agreed instructions provided in the Data Processing Agreement; you may request a copy of our Data Processing Agreement at dpo@sparkmailapp.com).\n\n\n\tExample: Company A purchased 15 licenses for employees. The \u0421ontroller of the employees\u2019 data is Company A, while we are the processor concerning this processing activity (namely, where we provide them with Spark services at the expense of Company A). As a data processor, Spark does not use such data (e.g., email addresses of third parties) for our own purposes, for example, for cold calls marketing.\n\t\n\tAs a result, we are processors for all personal data of Users, employees, or contractors of the three categories: the Organization, the Enterprise, and the User (Free or Premium).\n\n\nFor more details about our role as a Controller and a personal data Processor, please contact us at dpo@sparkmailapp.com. Alternatively, you can also send us a letter.\n\nContact Details of the DPO (Data Protection Officer)\n\nCompany: Spark Mail Limited.Address: Grand Canal House, 1 Grand Canal Street Upper, Dublin 4, D04 Y7R5, Ireland.\n\nExternal Data Protection Officer:\u00a0Privacity GmbH\nAddress:\u00a0Neuer Wall 50, 20354 Hamburg, Germany\n\nEmail: dpo@sparkmailapp.com\n\nIf you have a particularly sensitive request, please contact us or our Data Protection Officer by postal mail at the above indicated address.\n\nApplicability\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to the desktop and mobile versions of Spark compatible with macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows, accessible for download through our website, App Store, Mac App Store,\u00a0Microsoft Store,\u00a0Huawei AppGallery, and Google Play.\n\nLegal Grounds of Processing\n\nWe can process personal data based on the following legal bases:\n\n\n\tperformance of the contract for processing that is strictly necessary for service provision as written in Terms of Service, such as technical and customer support;\n\tlegitimate interest for processing that is reasonable for the User and required for the development of the service;\n\tconsent for additional processing for specific purposes;\n\tlegal obligation for the processing of data as required by applicable laws or if requested by a law enforcement agency, court, supervisory authority, or another state-authorized public body.\n\n\nIn particular, we rely on legitimate interests when we process your personal data for the following purposes:\n\n\n\tsecurity of the App: preventing risk and fraud;\n\tsupport: answering questions or providing other types of support;\n\tbusiness development: providing and improving our App;\n\tbusiness intelligence: providing reporting and analytics to further enhance our App;\n\tquality assurance: testing out features or additional services;\n\tmarketing: assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications.\n\n\nWe rely on our legitimate interest only after a careful assessment of the balance of purpose, necessity, and proportionality, and in a manner that is expected and does not limit your rights.\n\n\n\tExamples of consent:\n\t\"Spark\" Would Like to Send You Notifications\n\tNotifications may include alerts, sounds, and icon badges. These can be configured in Settings.\n\tDon\u2019t Allow / Allow\n\t\n\t\u201cSpark\u201d Would Like to Access Your Photos\n\tAccess to photos will let you attach photos:\n\tSelect Photos\u2026 / Allow Access to All Photos / Don\u2019t Allow\n\n\n\n\tExample of legitimate interest:\n\tWe collect the history of your requests made on the App in order to customize services we propose to you. Sometimes, we will write emails to our registered Users to inform them of our new features and products.\n\n\nPersonal Data in Spark: What We Collect\n\nThis section explains our approach and practices for processing personal data at different features in the App.\n\nBefore we start\n\nWe process two categories of data: technical and personal data you provide to us. Some of it can be seen on the client-side (interface), and some are processed on the backend.\n\nClient-Side is the part of the App displayed or takes place on the users\u2019 devices.\n\nBackend is an invisible crucial part of the App where algorithms operate on the variables and data points. In the majority of cases, it is crucial to process such data in order to provide our services to you. For example, we keep backend data taking into account organizational and technical measures to ensure the security of your data.\n\nAs defined, you may belong to one of the categories of Users:\n\n\n\tFree User (Free)\n\tPaying User (Premium)\n\tTeam\n\tOrganization\n\tEnterprise\n\n\nWe collect your personal data according to this Privacy Policy when you use the App. When you use our Website, your personal data is processed in accordance with the Website\u2019s Privacy Policy. Some of the data the App collects automatically, such as the country the App is used in: we get this data based on the IP address or from the App Store (we receive this information in a generalized form). Generally, all the data provided to us can either be linked to you or not (i.e., anonymized data).\n\nWe either create new personal data items or receive them from you. For example,\n\n\n\tdata we create and assign will include userID, subscription expiration date, appToken, and\n\tdata we collect from you or the third parties on your behalf would include payment history, requests, app usage data, account data, technical data.\n\n\nData Processed\n\nWe process some personal data for purely business purposes: to enable you to use our services, to notify you of our new products and features, to invite you to participate in our special programs and offers and beta testing programs, and to use parts of your data (usually pseudonymized) to monitor the trends and develop our product and business. We collect certain information about you when you provide it directly to us or use our App and Service. We only collect the information necessary to provide you with our services.\n\nUnless we specify a particular legal basis, we process your personal data based on the contract (our Terms of Service) (Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR: performance of contract).\n\nEmail address: As an email client, the core functionality of our Product is based on providing you with the ability to manage your email. For this reason, Spark services access your email account when you start using the App. Your email address is a unique identifier of you as a User within our system and allows us to secure your data. Your email address will also be used as a primary means of communication for us on anything related to changes to the App and Service, such as Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Beta Tester Agreement or core functionality of our App or Service. We may also use your email to sync your data with your third-party accounts (if you request us to do so in the App), or occasionally contact you for marketing purposes (it will be in our legitimate interests to do so). You will always have a chance to opt-out of such sync or any marketing communications for similar products and/or services anytime. Please note that your email is safe with us, and we do not use it for profiling or targeting.\n\nOAuth login or mail server credentials: Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages and other communication. Without such access, our Product will not be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience. In order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as \u201csend later\u201d, \u201csync between devices\u201d and where allowed by Apple \u2013 \u201cpush notifications\u201d we use Spark Services. Without using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.\n\nBilling data. We may need to process your personal data to ensure the smooth operation of your subscription plan and comply with the applicable laws. We do not have access to your sensitive payment data (as the payment processor will only collect your personal data to process the payment), but we may store your payment processor id, payment status, and information about your subscription terms (such as type and duration).\n\nIdentity of a team you join: In order to make team collaboration within Spark possible, we allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service. It allows you to share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts, private discussions, or create links to a specific email message. Team identity is necessary to associate you with that specific team as well as secure your information from people who are not a part of your team. Our system creates a record about the team only when you create one.\n\nEmail content while using Spark Services: We may retain your email (at your request) when you use the \u201cSend later\u201d feature - until the email is sent, or create links to specific emails - until you stop sharing of the email. This information is stored on our secure servers in order to make Services available to you.We also allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service. It allows you to have a secure space to share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts and have private discussions. To provide you with enhanced text editing functions and real-time collaboration features for the team, we link shared email drafts to the teamID. Such draft is processed on our secure servers to make Services available to you.\u00a0We store the snapshot of the email draft (final text)as long as the team exists or until you delete the draft.Please note that you are solely responsible for sharing your draft content (that may include personal data) with third parties, including team members.\nInput and output: When using Spark +AI, you can provide input (email text and prompt) for processing and receive generated output. We do not retain the content of your emails or prompts but only transmit them to the AI provider for processing. They do not use your data for model training and keep it no longer than 30 days. Read more about Spark +AI and its data processing practices in the \u2018AI Providers Data\u2019 section.\nEmail samples and writing style description: When you activate \u2018My Writing Style\u2019, we process your recently sent emails to analyze their length and other criteria and select appropriate samples (\u2018samples\u2019). Further, we pass the selected samples to the AI provider for analyzing your writing style and getting the textual description of it. Your emails are analysed for the samples and writing style description only once unless you use the \u2018Rescan email samples\u2019 option in the \u2018Settings\u2019, change the samples manually, or delete them and reactivate the feature.\nThe samples are stored in your account as settings of the feature. You can review the samples in the \u2018Settings\u2019 and manually replace them with other examples if you wish. We also store the samples and your writing style description in our backend.\u00a0\nTo help you generate email with Spark +AI further, we will pass only your writing style description along with each request to the AI provider.\nSpark will store the samples and your writing style description until you delete your account or until you delete all samples manually. Please note that when you delete all samples we automatically delete the writing style description.\nRead more about \u2018My writing style\u2019 in the \u2018AI Providers Data\u2019 section.\n+AI Meeting Notes and Summaries. When you activate the \u2018+AI Meeting Notes\u2019 feature, we process several types of data. This includes the audio stream, which is transcribed, in certain cases the video stream to extract the audio, the conversation transcript generated by a third-party AI provider, and user information such as participant names, User Spark ID, Team identity, subscription type, email addresses, and display names. We also handle a summary of the transcript created by a third-party AI provider, event details from Spark Calendar (including the event name, participants, and timeframe), your notes and any modifications made to the original output, as well as analytics data about feature usage, such as feedback, transcript length, and usage statistics. \u00a0\nYou can edit, copy, and share the transcript and/or summary using a link. These transcripts and summaries will remain in your Spark Account for as long as your account is active or until you choose to delete them. \u00a0\nSpark does not store the audio stream of the conversation unless you choose to share one with us for troubleshooting purposes. The AI provider may retain the audio stream for up to thirty (30) days as part of its abuse and misuse monitoring processes. After this period, the audio is deleted unless a longer retention period is required by law.\nAdditionally, neither Spark nor the AI providers use the data processed through this feature for large language model (LLM) training.\u00a0\nFor more details on how the \u2018+AI Meeting Notes\u2019 feature operates, please refer to the \u2018AI Providers Data\u2019 section.\nIP address and settings: The core functionality of our Product is based on an Internet connection, that is why our App and Service will not properly function without it. Your IP address is a unique identifier that lets you connect to the Internet, and our service will log connections for security and troubleshooting purposes. We also retain information about your settings so you may ensure the synchronization of your choices and experience between your devices.\n\nAPNS device token (Apple Push Notification Service): Push notifications allow you to get immediate updates about new emails or private team comments in your email inbox. You\u2019re free to enable or disable them during the initial App setup or later using your device\u2019s system preferences.\n\nApp token assigned by us: This token allows us to identify your device in our system and troubleshoot potential issues you might experience.\n\nDevice, App version, iOS version information: We need to have this information so the App functions properly on your specific device.\n\nStatistical information with regards to App usage: In order to better understand general app usage patterns and improve the Product and its user experience, Spark collects general statistical information about the usage of the Product. Collecting such data helps us optimize the App in future updates, and such usage does not affect your rights and freedoms and does not disclose any personal data of yourself or your contacts. You may read Amplitude\u2019s Privacy Policy to learn more about their processing of personal data.\n\nRecently accessed email messages, collaboration threads, and shared inboxes: We need this information to provide Spark Services to you and your teammates, such as private discussions around email, shared drafts, shared email conversations, and shared inboxes. By collecting and storing this data, we are able to present message discussion threads through your Spark App and provide a better communication experience with your team.\n\nSome of your email contacts: Spark Smart Notifications will send you push notifications only for important messages from real people. To block push notifications for promotional newsletters and automatic emails, we need to keep the \u201cwhitelist\u201d of senders for push notifications. We\u2019ll sync this \u201cwhitelist\u201d of contacts to our server to enable Smart Notifications. If you decide not to use Smart Notifications, we will never sync your email contacts.\nPixel data and link clicks information. We may use email and other marketing software to collect metrics on our marketing campaigns. Usually, pixels help their providers to collect technical data, such as the time when the image was loaded and the IP address, etc. For example, we may use the Braze service to see email opening rate, and then use this opening rate to enhance our emails and send our users a more helpful material or relevant offer in the future. Braze can also register that the link in the email was clicked on. You may disable pixels in your email service provider\u2019s settings and avoid opening links, if you don\u2019t want to participate in the collection of this statistics. In Spark, you should go to the \u201cGeneral\u201d section of Settings page to disable loading the pixels.\n\nLogs: Some information about your use of the Spark Mail services can be stored either by us or by your device. When we collect this information on our servers, we do so to prevent fraud and potential unauthorized access to your personal information, ensuring the technical availability and security of the App. The server that hosts the App may record requests your device makes to the server, the details on the device and browser you use, your IP address, date and time of access, city and country, operating system, browser type, mobile network information. This data is used only for technical purposes \u2013 that is, to ensure the proper functioning and security of the App,to investigate possible security incidents, and to troubleshoot bugs and problems with the App reported by you. If you report an issue that prevents you from enjoying Spark, we may need the log data that is contained on your device to investigate the issue and troubleshoot. As we cannot obtain those logs without you sending them to us, we will rely on your consent.\n\nCustomer Support communication: We process and store email or support chat communication, including attachments and information you voluntarily decide to share with us for troubleshooting purposes whenever you communicate with our support team.\nTo enhance your experience, we collect analytics on customer support requests (excluding any attachments) to understand the most frequent inquiries and identify areas for improvement within the App. This analysis is conducted internally within Spark using secure, in-house technologies, including pre-trained machine learning models. Rest assured, we do not use your personal data to test or train these models.\nRequest a feature: When you contact us via the \u201cRequest a feature\u201d form with your proposal for our product enhancement, we process your email address, type of device, your name (if you\u2019re willing to share it), and any other additional information you may provide in the form. We process this data based on your consent. We automatically collect some technical information (platform, app version, date of installation, Spark ID and Braze ID) for a detailed analysis of your proposal. It is in our legitimate interest to do so. Also, we assign a unique identifier (token) for each form submission and collect the date and time of the submission.\nWe use Typeform to collect your request and Google Sheets to process it further.

This data is used only to improve the App and to test or troubleshoot quality issues, such as bugs, in accordance with the Microsoft Store App Developer Agreement.\n\nYour Feedback. We may publish your feedback, reviews and comments about your experience with our App (\"Feedback\") on our website, in the App or otherwise. This includes the Feedback you provide to us directly or via any platform, including but not limited to online distribution platforms, marketplaces, and social media. We process personal data in your Feedback, which may include your first and last name, username, the text of the Feedback and/or any other information contained in or related to the Feedback such as rating, date and time, platform etc. We do not process personal data of children under the age of 16 and/or sensitive types of data in the Feedback.\nWe may use your Feedback for marketing and advertising purposes: to showcase the capabilities and features of the App, share real user experiences, and attract potential customers. Your Feedback may be distributed in marketing and advertising materials, published, and, if applicable, your photo may be edited for these purposes. Under the GDPR, we rely on our legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing personal data in Feedback collected from third-party platforms, such as online distribution platforms, marketplaces, and social media, for such purposes. For Feedback provided directly to us, we will request your consent before it. For more information about your Feedback, please refer to the \"Your Feedback\" section of our Terms of Service.\nTo enhance the App experience, we collect analytics on the feedback to understand the most frequent inquiries and identify areas for improvement within the App. This analysis is conducted internally within Spark using secure, in-house technologies, including pre-trained machine learning models.

However, if such data is collected and processed alongside other data points or data items (such as name, telephone number, email, etc.), it can identify a particular person and therefore constitutes personal data. You may check the official position of the EU by reading:\n\n\n\tRecital 26 of the GDPR,\n\tArticle 4 of the GDPR,\n\tOpinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data issued by the Working Party 29 (predecessor of the EDPB), and\n\tGuidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users issued by the EDPB.\n\n\nPlease note that we do not store all the data we receive from you. Mainly, the data is stored locally on your device. This means we see pseudonymized or even anonymized data. For more information on retention periods of your personal data please see \u201cTerm of storage and retention periods\" section of this Privacy Policy.\n\nGoogle User Data\n\nSpark's use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. This section may be helpful for you if you use Spark in conjunction with your Gmail account.\n\nPermissions. When seeking access to your Google user data, all permission requests are being sent by Spark Mail App. Your authorized client credentials to access your Gmail account provided to us will be kept confidential. We request access only to the information we need; we will prompt you to refresh the access permissions if we implement new features. Where possible, we will use incremental auth.\n\nRevoking access to Google User Data. You may revoke Spark\u2019s access to your Gmail account by using Gmail settings: My Account -> Security tab -> Third-party apps with account access -> Manage third-party access -> Spark -> Remove access.\n\nIf you decide to do so, we will lose access to your Gmail account in Spark, and we will no longer be able to show you emails from it, and show and sync your Google Calendar. Upon your request (and when you delete your Spark account), we will delete all data collected from your Gmail account; however, in such a case, we may not be able to provide you with the ability to use Spark Mail features to work with your Gmail emails.\n\nTypes of data requested. We will list the types of data requested on the permission request webpage. If we need more (or less) permissions to run our Service, we will prompt a new permission request for you to review and consent (or reject). Not all Google User Data may contain personal data. Some statistical data will be anonymized.\n\nRequest purpose. The purpose for which the App requests your user data is to enable you to use Spark Mail features when working with your Gmail account emails. Without access to the emails, we cannot provide you with the features that include assessing, using, writing, changing, deleting, storing, sharing, filtering, whitelisting, and other manipulations with the emails as described in this Data Processed (by feature) section that are performed on your behalf (in other words, pursuant to your instructions issued by manipulating the Spark\u2019s interface). We do not use your Google User Data for any other purposes but to provide you with access and the ability to use the Spark Mail Service.\n\nDisclaimer. We do not use Google User Data to display, sell, or distribute this data to any third party conducting surveillance. Spark Mail has no hidden features, services, or actions that are not mentioned in this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service. Spark takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect all applications or systems that make use of Google User Data against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure. Spark Mail belongs to a Permitted Application Type as mentioned in the Google API Services User Data Policy (namely, an application that enhances the email experience for productivity purposes).\n\nWith regard to the access to Google User Data as specified above, we will:\n\n\n\tuse access only to read, write, modify, or control Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide a web email client that allows Users to compose, send, read, and process emails and will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets;\n\tnot use this Gmail data for serving advertisements, including retargeting, personalized, or interest-based advertising;\n\tnot allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement (consent) to view specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating a bug or abuse, complying with applicable law, investigating an issue, and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized;\n\tensure that your employees, agents, contractors, and successors comply with this Google API Services: User Data Policy.\n\n\nAI Providers Data\nWe use different AI models working locally on your device and third-party AI Providers (Azure OpenAI Service by Microsoft Corporation, Open AI by Open AI LLC, and Vertex AI by Google) to offer the Spark +AI feature, which is designed to help you create and edit emails with the help of machine learning algorithms. We may switch between the AI providers to provide a more secure and faster service, to run new versions of models, or for other commercially justifiable reasons. The switch between AI providers is manual, and we retain full control over it.\nPlease note that, in the event of a switch between AI Providers, the data processing rules and interaction protocols will remain the same as described below. We will not provide notification about such switches.\nApplicability. This section of the Privacy Policy applies only to our Premium Users of Spark 3 who use the Spark +AI feature or Users who get access to it during the Trial period. By default, Spark +AI is switched off: you must opt in to enable the Spark +AI feature.\nPermissions. We use the AI Providers' services and Spark +AI based on your consent. By using Spark +AI, you consent to the processing of your personal data by us as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the use of the AI Providers' services, you should not switch on the Spark +AI feature that incorporates it.

Spark +AI does not send emails on your behalf. You have full control over the generated content at all times, and you can review and edit it any time before sending.\u00a0\nUse of Spark +AI data. Spark +AI is designed to protect your private data we obtain from you or about you. We do not store the contents of your emails and your requests for the Spark +AI feature. If you choose to use the Spark +AI feature, we will only transfer the textual context of your email to Microsoft to process your request and generate or edit email text based on that and additional context.\nModel training. We do not use your private data to train Microsoft, OpenAI or any other machine learning model when you use the Spark +AI feature. Any information, including personal data, that you furnish while using the Spark +AI feature will be shared with the AI Providers solely for the purpose of functioning of the Spark +AI feature. We do not permit the AI Providers to use your personal data for any other purpose except for debugging in the event of a failure and to monitor the potential misuse or abuse of their services. According to the AI Providers' documentation, they do not use customer data to train, retrain, or improve the base models.\nSecurity of Spark +AI data. Your email content and requests you make to Spark +AI are private and encrypted in accordance with our standard privacy and information security practices. We implement the latest commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect your personal data both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained in Spark, or third party services.\nInput and Output. You may provide input (prompt) to be processed by Spark +AI (\u201cInput\u201d), and receive output generated and returned by Spark +AI based on the Input (\u201cOutput\u201d). When you use Spark +AI, Input and Output are your customer data (\u201cCustomer Data\u201d). You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of your Customer Data.\n\u2018My Writing Style\u2019 feature. This is an AI-powered feature based on profiling. Profiling refers to the automated processing of personal data to assess specific aspects of a person. In this case, profiling does not result in any legal implications for you, nor does it significantly impact you in a similar manner. It analyzes a selection of your recently sent emails (referred to as \u2018samples\u2019) to learn and mimic your writing style. Subsequently, it applies your writing style and tone of voice to all new Spark +AI-generated email drafts.\u00a0\nBy default, the feature is turned off. You can activate or deactivate it within the \u2018Writing Assistant\u2019 of the \u2018Spark+ AI\u2019 section in your account settings.\nWhen you turn on the feature, we automatically select samples that meet the length and other criteria from your recently sent emails and pass such samples to the AI provider to get the description of your writing style. The AI Provider will not have access to your other emails. Further, the description of your style will be sent to the AI provider along with each request when you draft new emails with Spark +AI.\nRead more about samples, their review, and deletion in the \u2018Email samples\u2019 subsection of \u2018Data Processed.\u2019\n\u2018+AI Meeting Notes\u2019 feature. This tool provides AI-powered audio transcription and summarization, allowing you to generate meeting transcripts and AI-driven summaries. You can easily edit, copy, and share them via a link.\nThis feature is disabled by default. You can activate it by selecting \u201cStart transcription\u201d in the pop-up notification, or \u201cStart Ad-Hoc Meeting\u201d in the Calendar Agenda pop up, or from menus within the App. After you turn on this feature, please ensure that you inform the meeting participants that you are making a meeting transcription via Spark. \u00a0\nThe feature captures an audio stream on your device with the help of the on-device AI model. Once the meeting ends or you finish the transcription, the audio stream is automatically sent to the third-party AI provider for obtaining a transcription, which is further summarized. The transcription and summary are saved in your Spark account.\nRead more about transcripts and summary, and their deletion in the \u2018Meeting Notes and Summaries\u2019 subsection of \u2018Data Processed.\u2019\n\nAge Limitation\n\nPlease pay attention. We do not knowingly process the data from Users under the age of 16 without a legal representative\u2019s consent. If you are such a User or the user\u2019s legal representative, please inform us by email at dpo@sparkmailapp.com.\n\nTerm of Storage and Retention Periods\n\nThe retention periods mentioned in this section have been calculated by taking into account the data minimization principle enshrined in the GDPR and applicable laws that affect the processing of personal data. We analyzed the processing of data on every step of data processing and calculated the shortest periods necessary to meet the purposes of data processing.\n\nPlease read this section together with the retention periods provided in the descriptions of the features.\n\nIn general, we store personal data for the following periods of time:\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUser (Free)\n\t\t\t\tUser (Premium) and representatives of Organizations and Enterprises\n\t\t\t\tTeams(Free and Premium)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tProcessing and retention: duration of the contract (Terms of Service). If the User is inactive for 36 months, Spark will send two reminder emails notifying that the Account will be suspended (and personal data deleted) unless the User logs in.The User will then have some time (\u201crenewal period\u201d) to log in to the Account and renew their Free Subscription. Otherwise, the Account will be deleted upon the expiry of the renewal period.At the User\u2019s request, their Account can be retrieved after the deletion but not later than after 12 months after the User refused to activate the Account or ignored the reminder emails.\n\t\t\t\tProcessing and retention: duration of the contract (Terms of Service or personalized service contract for Enterprise(s)). If the charges cannot be withdrawn from the User, their Account then downgrades to the Free User subscription terms. The retention period is triggered on the day when the subscription plan changes, Spark will send two reminder emails after 36 months of inactivity, as described in the column on the left.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe retention and archiving periods are aligned with the service contract terms.\n\t\t\t\tProcessing and retention: duration of the contract (the Terms of Service). If the last remaining Team member is inactive for 36 months (if they were using Free Subscription), Spark will send to the last remaining User the reminder that the Team data will be deleted unless the User logs in during the renewal period outlined in the reminder emails. Intra-Team communications that contain personal data will be retained as long as the Team owner remains an active Premium User.\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the User\u2019s request, their Account can be retrieved after the deletion but not later than after 36 months after the User refused to activate the Account or ignored the reminder emails.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nConsent. We process the data based on your consent during the general term unless you withdraw it. After you withdraw your consent, it will take us up to 30 calendar days to erase your data.\n\nUpdates and marketing emails. We may send you emails describing our new updates, features, discounts or opportunities. Given that the major updates are rare and Spark works closely with the users\u2019 requests for new features, we may keep your data for up to a few years (but no longer than 6 years after the User account is deemed abandoned) to keep you informed of new opportunities Spark offers. You will always have the option to unsubscribe using the link at the end of the email or contact us via email at dpo@sparkmailapp.com to opt out from receiving such emails.\n\nCustomer Support communication. We may retain the history of communication (including the contents of the communication, attached files, etc) between you and our Customer Support team for a few years but no longer than 6 years (as provided by the general statute of limitations in Ireland) to be able to respond to all your further questions and requests or inquiries of the entities that you authorize to act on your behalf, including those of legal nature. We apply necessary security measures to ensure that the communications and attachments are archived with access to them restricted.Where you shared the audio stream from the +AI Meeting Notes and Summaries feature for troubleshooting purposes, we will delete it immediately once the issue is localized.\nYour Feedback. We will retain the Feedback which you provided to us directly for 5 years and the one which was collected from the third-party platform for 2 years, or until you withdraw your consent (where applicable), unless the law compels us to store it for longer in case of any procedures or actions. However, we reserve the right to delete your Feedback at any time at our sole discretion. You may also contact us at support@sparkmailapp.com to request that we refrain from or cease using your Feedback.\u00a0\n\nDeletion. We will delete the data we process as a Controller under GDPR within one (1) month following the request. In case the request is complex or we have received a number of requests from the same individual, we may extend the time to respond to it by a further 2 months. We will inform you of any such prolongation within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay in response.\n\nWe store your personal data either until you delete the Account or after a certain period depending on the data type. When a retention period expires, we either delete your personal data or anonymize it so that it cannot be restored.\n\nSummary of Retention Details:\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tType of information\n\t\t\t\tTerm of storage\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmail address, email content, mail server credentials, APNS device token, appToken assigned by us, device info\n\t\t\t\tDuring the services provision period or the period of beta testing as applicable + archive time\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you delete Spark Account: 3 months after deletion of your Spark Account.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you request the data erasure: we will erase your data within 30 days of your request. In case the request is complex, or we have received a number of requests from the same individual, we may extend the time to respond to it by a further 2 months. After we delete your data, it will be stored for 1 week in our backups.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRecent messages from your inbox\n\t\t\t\tDeleted after 4 hours\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmails pending in the Send Later feature, IP addresses\n\t\t\t\tDeleted once the message is sent\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmails of Shared Inboxes\n\t\t\t\tStored during the provision of the services and deleted once the Shared Inboxes are deleted.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDevice and interaction information received when beta-testing the iOS version of the App\n\t\t\t\tDuring your participation in the beta testing and for one (1) year after its completion of the testing or termination of your Beta Tester Agreement by you or Spark, whichever occurs earlier.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nAfter the above respective periods expire, we delete your personal data. It may be stored for statistical and analytical purposes in anonymized form.\n\nWe process your personal data based on your consent during the provision of services, during the term of storage (as defined above), or until you withdraw your consent, depending on the Feature.\n\nBackup Storage\n\nWe store your data in the backups of databases.

We share your personal data with our contractors to the extent necessary to provide services, technical and customer support. In addition, we can share your data on the following grounds: consent, compliance with the law (or legal obligation), and legitimate interest. Also, we have implemented organizational and technical measures to ensure the security of personal data during data transfer to third-party.\n\nDetails:\n\nConsent. We share your personal data based on your explicit consent.\n\nCompliance with the law. We will disclose your personal data to third parties to the extent that it is necessary:\n\n\n\tto comply with a government request, court order, or applicable law;\n\tto prevent unlawful use of our App or violation of the Terms of Service and our policies;\n\tto protect against claims of third parties;\n\tto help prevent or investigate fraud.\n\n\nLegitimate interest or performance of the contract. We may share your personal data with third parties based on a public offer for processing on our behalf, subject to technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data. We may transfer your personal data to certain companies, consultants, and contractors hired to provide certain services on our behalf.\nIndependent data controllers. We may sometimes receive your personal data from other, independent data controllers. We usually do so in one of two cases:\n\n\tthe third-party data controller shares your personal data with us in response to your request (for example, when you sync Spark Mail with your account in another app); and/or\n\tan app store shares some data about on-market or in-app purchases, crash events, failed attempts to download or launch the app, or any other information that may affect your ability to buy, download, and use Spark Mail and its features on your device. For example, such independent data controllers can be Mac App Store, App Store, Microsoft Store, Google Play, and Huawei AppGallery depending on your choice and device.\n\nWe process these personal data only to enable you to use Spark Mail or its particular features (for example, to fix the bugs that do not allow your device to launch the app). We will not use your data received from these independent controllers to build any profile about you, or use it for any marketing or advertising purposes. We anonymize or aggregate these data where possible (such as where there is no request from you to our tech support to help fix the bug) before processing.\n\nSubcontractors.

The data is stored in the USA by default, but we may need to process your personal data in another country. We also share some data with our service providers in Ukraine.\nThe European Commission has recognised the United States (commercial organisations participating in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework) as providing adequate protection. In particular, Google LLC and its wholly-owned US subsidiaries (unless explicitly excluded), have certified that they adhere to the DPF Principles.\n\nThere is no adequate decision by the European Commission regarding Ukraine. Therefore, we have prepared a data processing agreement based on the standards of the Standard Contractual Clauses and carried out the legislation assessments for data protection during transfer and storage in third countries under the GDPR, such as Ukraine.\n\nYou can read detailed information on measures we take to protect your personal data here and, if signed, in our Data Processing Agreement with you. If you upload, send or create personal data of your clients or other data subjects via one of our Services, you may ask for a signed Data Processing Agreement by sending an email to dpo@sparkmailapp.com.\n\nSecurity Measures\n\nWe regularly perform Data Protection Impact Assessments to ensure that we use an appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed. We follow ISO 27001 Standard to put all security controls in place as a basis.\n\nTo be more specific, to protect your personal data, we use HTTPS and encryption, divided group and individual access (where appropriate), alarm systems, corporate VPN, written approved internal policies (like password policy and physical access policy).\n\nMoreover, we systematically monitor our technologies\u2019 state of the art and never forget about the backups. All our contractors are under contractual obligations which are compliant with the GDPR requirements.\n\nHere you can find information about the steps we mentioned above:\n\nTrained team\n\nOur team is competent in the matter of your personal data protection.

Your email and account credentials are stored on secure cloud-based servers using symmetric and asymmetric encryption: private and public keys.\n\nWe currently use Google (\"Hosting providers\"). These Hosting providers have various international security certificates that ensure your data safety.\n\n\n\tApp Center. You can read more on the security measures via the link.\n\tGoogle. You can read more on the security measures via the link.\n\n\nSecurity measures (detailed explanation):\n\n1. Physical access control: group access and alarm system\n\nWe secure access to the premises via ID readers, so only authorized persons have access to them. The ID cards can be blocked individually; access is also logged.\n\nAn alarm system is installed on the premises, preventing infiltration by unauthorized persons. The alarm system is linked to a locking mechanism for the doors.\n\n2. System access control: individual access and password policy\n\nEach employee has access to the systems/services only via their employee access. The access rights involved are limited to the responsibilities of the respective employee and/or team.\n\nPassword policy. We regulate access to our systems via password procedures and the use of SSH keys of at least 4096 bits in length. The SSH keys strengthen the productive systems against attacks that target weak passwords, as password-based access to the relevant systems is disabled.\n\nWe have, in addition, a regulation for the creation of passwords. This guarantees higher security also for systems that offer password-based access.\n\nPasswords must meet specific requirements. It must be at least:\n\n\n\t12 characters long\n\t1 letter in upper-case\n\t1 letter in lower-case\n\t1 number\n\t1 special symbol\n\n\nOur systems are protected by firewalls that reject all incoming connections by default. Only connection types defined by exception are accepted.\n\n3. Data access control: monitoring and physical access policy.\n\nAll servers and services are subject to continuous monitoring. This includes the logging of personal access in the user interface.\n\nDue to the proximity of the employees, a visual inspection is possible at any time.\n\nLocking and/or logging off when leaving work is prescribed and practiced.\n\n4. Transfer control: contractual obligations and corporate VPN\n\nBefore transferring any data, we specify organizational and security requirements in Data Processing and Data Transfer Agreements (if applicable). These agreements are obligatory for every Enterprise and us as the Controller.\n\nFurthermore, the handling of local data storage devices, e.g., USB sticks, is regulated via agreements.\n\nAccess to the systems outside the company network is possible only via secure VPN access.\n\n5. Input control: general restriction\n\nOur employees do not work directly at the database level but instead, use applications to access the data.\n\nIT employees access the system via individual access and use a common login.\n\n6. Availability control: backups and division\n\nWe ensure the availability of data in several ways. For example, there is a regular backup of the entire system. This can be used if the other availability measures fail.\n\nCritical services are operated redundantly in multiple data centers and controlled by a high-availability system.\n\nOur workstations are also protected with the usual measures. For example, virus scanners are installed, and laptops are encrypted.\n\nWe would like to specify that we use MDM-solution to protect employee devices with security settings.\n\n7. Separation control: limited access.\n\nWe use logically separate databases to prevent unauthorized persons from accidentally reading data with limited access.\n\nAccess to the data is also restricted because employees use services (applications) that control access.\n\n\nPrivacy Rights\n\nEU privacy rights\n\nYou, as subjects of personal data, have the following rights:\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRight\n\t\t\t\tDescription\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRight to access\n\t\t\t\tYou can request an explanation of the processing of your personal data.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRight to rectification\n\t\t\t\tYou can change the information if it is inaccurate or incomplete.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRight to erasure\n\t\t\t\tYou can send us a request to delete your personal data from our systems.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRight to data portability\n\t\t\t\tYou can request all the data that you provided to us, as well as request to transfer data to another Controller.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRight to object\n\t\t\t\tYou can object to the processing of your data.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRight to restriction\n\t\t\t\tYou may partially or wholly prohibit us from processing your personal data.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRight to withdraw consent\n\t\t\t\tYou can withdraw your consent at any time.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRight to lodge a complaint\n\t\t\t\tIf your request is not satisfied, you can file a complaint to the regulatory body.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nTo exercise your rights, write us an email at dpo@sparkmailapp.com.

In such an event, an operator cannot knowingly use, disclose, or compile that child\u2019s personal information, nor can an operator allow another to do the same. An operator that provides a covered service or platform cannot advertise or market content inappropriate for children. In this regard, DOPPA provides an enumerated list of prohibited content, including alcohol, tobacco, firearms, fireworks, tanning equipment and facilities, lotteries and gambling, tattoos, drug paraphernalia, and pornography.
