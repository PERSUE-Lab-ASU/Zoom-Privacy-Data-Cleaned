A transaction like this may involve the disclosure of personally identifying information to prospective or actual purchasers and/or receiving such information from sellers. It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for your information in these types of transactions, including notifying you if a different company will receive this information. Any successor in a merger or acquisition shall be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-Party Links</strong> \u2013 We may provide links to external websites in order to make certain content and services available to you.

When engaged, most DNT features send a signal or preference to websites that you do not want to be tracked. Those websites or their third-party advertisers or content providers may continue to engage in activity you may view as tracking, even after you use the DNT, depending on the websites\u2019 privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, VoiceVibes does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of DNT signals and to remain compliant with industry standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Data That You Direct Us to Share</strong> \u2013 You can direct us to share data with other parties.

VoiceVibes uses the so-called two-click solution. This means that when you visit our Website, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plug- ins. You can recognise the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box above its initial letter or the logo. VoiceVibes offers you the possibility to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. Only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it, the plug-in provider receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding Website of our online offer. In addition, the data mentioned in the section \u201cCollection of personal data when you visit our Website\u201d of this Privacy Policy will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook, the IP address is anonymised immediately after collection, according to the respective provider. By activating the plug-in, personal data is transferred from you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there. Since the plug-in provider collects data mainly via cookies, VoiceVibes recommends that you delete all cookies before clicking on the greyed-out box using your browser\u2019s security settings.</li>\n<li>VoiceVibes has no influence on the data collected and data processing processes, nor is VoiceVibes aware of the full extent of data collection, the purposes of processing, or the storage periods. VoiceVibes does not have information on the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider.</li>\n<li>The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses these for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its Website. Such an evaluation takes place in particular (also for non-logged-in users) for the representation of suitable advertisements and in order to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our Website. You have a right of objection to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right. Through the plug-ins, VoiceVibes offers you the ability to interact with social networks and other users, so that VoiceVibes can improve our service and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.</li>\n<li>The data is passed on regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your data collected with us will be directly assigned to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you click the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. VoiceVibes recommends that you log out regularly after using a social network, especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.</li>\n<li>Further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider can be found in the privacy policy of these providers listed below. They will also provide you with further information about your rights in this regard and how to set options to protect your privacy.</li>\n<li>Addresses of the respective plug-in providers and URLs with their data protection information:<br>\na) LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA;http://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.

If you are logged into Google, your information will be directly associated with your account. If you do not wish to be associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as user profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website.

Those websites or their third-party advertisers or content providers may continue to engage in activity you may view as tracking, even after you use the DNT, depending on the websites\u2019 privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, VoiceVibes does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of DNT signals and to remain compliant with industry standards.\nData That You Direct Us to Share \u2013 You can direct us to share data with other parties. For example, you may authorize us to send status updates to your Facebook or Twitter account or direct us to share data with your employer as part of a corporate training program.

VoiceVibes uses the so-called two-click solution. This means that when you visit our Website, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plug- ins. You can recognise the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box above its initial letter or the logo. VoiceVibes offers you the possibility to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. Only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it, the plug-in provider receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding Website of our online offer. In addition, the data mentioned in the section \u201cCollection of personal data when you visit our Website\u201d of this Privacy Policy will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook, the IP address is anonymised immediately after collection, according to the respective provider. By activating the plug-in, personal data is transferred from you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there. Since the plug-in provider collects data mainly via cookies, VoiceVibes recommends that you delete all cookies before clicking on the greyed-out box using your browser\u2019s security settings.\nVoiceVibes has no influence on the data collected and data processing processes, nor is VoiceVibes aware of the full extent of data collection, the purposes of processing, or the storage periods. VoiceVibes does not have information on the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider.\nThe plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses these for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its Website. Such an evaluation takes place in particular (also for non-logged-in users) for the representation of suitable advertisements and in order to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our Website. You have a right of objection to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right. Through the plug-ins, VoiceVibes offers you the ability to interact with social networks and other users, so that VoiceVibes can improve our service and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.\nThe data is passed on regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your data collected with us will be directly assigned to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you click the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. VoiceVibes recommends that you log out regularly after using a social network, especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.\nFurther information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider can be found in the privacy policy of these providers listed below. They will also provide you with further information about your rights in this regard and how to set options to protect your privacy.\nAddresses of the respective plug-in providers and URLs with their data protection information:\na) LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA;http://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.

In addition, the data mentioned in the section \u201cCollection of personal data when you visit our Website\u201d of this Privacy Policy will be transmitted. This does not depend on whether YouTube provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged into Google, your information will be directly associated with your account. If you do not wish to be associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as user profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such evaluation takes place in particular (even for non-logged-in users) to provide demand- oriented advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our Website.

Where VoiceVibes has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to GDPR, VoiceVibes will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.\nSecurity.\nVoiceVibes will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.\nEnforcement.\nVoiceVibes will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy. Any employee that VoiceVibes determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\nRetention of Personal Information.\nIf your VoiceVibes account becomes inactive because it was not timely renewed, and you have not opted in to permit us to retain your personal information, we will keep your personal information for a period of three months prior to beginning the process of deleting it. This will enable us to promptly reactivate your account in the event you renew during the initial three month period. Once the process of deleting your personal information has begun, it is possible that it may take up to an additional three months for all copies of your personal information to be removed from all of VoiceVibes\u2019 systems, backups, log files, and archives.\nObjection or revocation of the processing of your data\n\nIf you have given your consent to the processing of your data, you can revoke it at any time. Such revocation affects the lawfulness of processing your personal data after you have made it known to us.\nIf we base the processing of your personal data on the weighing of interests, you may object to the processing. This is the case in particular if processing is not necessary to fulfil a contract with you, which we explain in the following description of the functions. When you do object, we would ask you to explain the reasons why we should not process your personal data. In the event of a justified objection, we will examine the situation and either stop or adjust data processing, or point out to you our compelling reasons worthy of protection, on the basis of which we will continue processing.\nOf course, you can object to the processing of your personal data for the purposes of advertising and data analysis at any time.
