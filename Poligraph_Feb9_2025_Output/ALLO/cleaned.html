<p>Effective as of June 4, 2021.</p>
<p>This “Privacy Policy” describes the privacy practices of BeeCanvas, Inc. and its corporate affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Allo”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) in connection with the (i) <a href="http://www.allo.io/?from_path=%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fprivacy-policy" title="ALLO">www.allo.io</a> website; (ii) the Allo mobile application; (iii) any other website or mobile application that we own or control and which posts or links to this Privacy Policy; and (iv) the online whiteboard designed to facilitate visual collaboration (the Platform), (collectively, the “Service”).  This Privacy Policy also describes the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to their information.  Allo may provide additional or supplemental privacy policies to individuals for specific products or services that we offer at the time we collect personal information. These supplemental privacy policies will govern how we may process the information in the context of the specific product or service.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the personal information we process as a data controller, that is, as the party that determines what personal information to collect and for what purposes. You provide some of this information directly, and we get some of it by collecting information about your interactions, use, and experiences with the Service as further explained in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>On the Platform and if you use it through a Allo enterprise customer, Allo processes visual collaboration and other information on our enterprise customers’ behalf.  Our customers are considered data controllers and when we process information on their behalf, it is in accordance with their instructions.  If you are a user of the Allo Platform through an enterprise customer, the relevant customer’s privacy policy and the agreement between the customer and Allo govern the processing of your personal information.  For more information, please contact the relevant customer.</p>
<p>The Service is designed for businesses and is not intended for personal or household use.  Accordingly, we treat all personal information covered by this Privacy Policy, including information about any visitors to our website, as pertaining to individuals acting as business representatives rather than in their personal capacity.</p>
<p>We provide important information for individuals located in the European Union, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:European_Economic_Area_(EEA)?from_path=%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fprivacy-policy" target="_blank" title="Glossary: European  Economic  Area (ee A)">European Economic Area</a>), Switzerland and United Kingdom (collectively, “Europe” or “European”) <a href="https://allo.io/legal/en/privacy-policy?from_path=%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fprivacy-policy#notice-to-european-users" title="Privacy Policy">below</a>.</p>

European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/?from_path=%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fprivacy-policy" target="_blank" title="www.youronlinechoices.eu">here</a>, selecting the user’s country, and then clicking “Choices” (or similarly titled link). Users of our mobile applications may opt out of receiving targeted advertising in mobile apps through participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by installing the AppChoices mobile app, available <a href="https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices?from_path=%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fprivacy-policy" target="_blank" title="Appchoices">here</a>, and selecting the user’s choices. Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above.</p>
<p>In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit our, or our partners’, ability to engage in ad tracking or targeted advertising using the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising associated with your mobile device.</p>
<p>If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track.</strong>  Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit.  We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” or similar signals.

<p><strong>Choosing not to share your personal information.</strong> Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your personal information in order to provide the Service to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or you later ask to delete it), we may not be able to provide you with our services.  We will tell you what information you must provide to receive the Service by designating it as required at the time of collection or through other appropriate means.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party platforms or social media networks.</strong> If you choose to connect to the Service via a third-party platform or social media network, you may have the ability to limit the information that we may obtain from the third-party at the time you login to the Service using the third-party’s authentication service or otherwise connect your account. Subsequently, you may be able to control your settings through the third-party’s platform or service. For example, you may access and change your settings through the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications&amp;from_path=%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fprivacy-policy" target="_blank" title="Settings">settings page</a> for Apps and Websites. If you withdraw our ability to access certain information from a third-party platform or social media network, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third-party.</p>
<h2 id="other-sites-mobile-applications-and-services">Other Sites, Mobile Applications and Services</h2>
<p>The Service may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties.  These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party.  In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us. We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions.  Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and mobile applications and online services you use.</p>
<h2 id="security-practices">Security Practices</h2>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  We employ a number of organizational, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect.  However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.</p>
<h2 id="international-data-transfers">International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>We are headquartered in the United States and may have service providers in other countries, and your personal information may be transferred to the United States or other locations outside of your state, province, or country where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your state, province, or country.</p>
<p>European users should read the important information provided <a href="https://allo.io/legal/en/privacy-policy?from_path=%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fprivacy-policy#notice-to-european-users" title="Privacy Policy">below</a> about transfer of personal information outside of Europe.</p>
<h2 id="children">Children</h2>
<p>As a general rule, children are not allowed to use the Service, and we do not collect personal information from them. We define "children" as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Residents outside of Europe: anyone under 13 years old; and</li>
<li>Residents of Europe: anyone under 16 years old, or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal information in your country of residence.</li>
<li>If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian, we will delete it.  We encourage parents with concerns to <a href="https://allo.io/legal/en/privacy-policy?from_path=%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fprivacy-policy#how-to-contact-us" title="Privacy Policy">contact us</a>.</li>

<h2 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the Service. We may, and if required by law will, also provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach you, such as via e-mail (if you have an account where we have your contact information) or another manner through the Service.</p>
<p>Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the Service after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Use for new purposes.</strong> We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it.  If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive personal information.</strong>  We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Service, or otherwise to us.</p>
<p>If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Service, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Retention</strong></p>
<p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.  If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>Your rights</strong></p>
<p>European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information.  If you are located within Europe, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access.</strong>  Provide you with information about our processing of your personal information and give you access to your personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Correct.</strong>  Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Delete.</strong>  Delete your personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer.</strong>  Transfer a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice.</li>
<li><strong>Restrict.</strong>  Restrict the processing of your personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Object.</strong>  Object to our reliance on our legitimate interests as the basis of our processing of your personal information that impacts your rights.</li>
