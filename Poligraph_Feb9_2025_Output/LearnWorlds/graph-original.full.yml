  - Additionally, we've specifically assessed the risks raised by the Court of Justice

    LearnWorlds as theoretical applications of Executive Order 12333 and the U.S.
    Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are unlikely to impact LearnWorlds in any
    way since the services we offer are not in the following sectors (e.g., telecommunication
    providers, ISPs, military etc) therefore the data we process should be of no interest
