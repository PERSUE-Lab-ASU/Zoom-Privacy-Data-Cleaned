How Do You Use My Personal Data?</h2>\n<p>Under the GDPR, we must always have a lawful basis for using Personal Data.

We do not use your Personal Data in this way.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>With your permission and/or where permitted by law, we may also use your Personal Data for marketing purposes, which may include contacting you by email or telephone or text message with information, news, and offers on Our Platform and Services. You will not be sent any unlawful marketing content or spam. We will always work to fully protect your rights and comply with our obligations under the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and you will always have the opportunity to opt-out.</p>\n\n<p>Third Parties whose digital tools we use on Our Site and Platform may use third-party Cookies, as detailed in our <a href=\"https://www.learnworlds.com/cookie-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cookie policy</a>. Please note that we do not control the activities of such third parties, nor the data they collect and use themselves, and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such third parties.</p>\n\n<h2>8. How Can I Control My Personal Data?</h2>\n<p>In addition to your rights under the GDPR, set out in Part 7, when you submit Personal Data via Our Site and Platform, you may be given options to restrict our use of your Personal Data. In particular, we provide you with strong controls on our use of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from us which you may do by unsubscribing using the links provided in our emails, at the point of providing your details, or and by managing your Account).</p>\n\n<h2>9. How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data?</h2>\n<p>We will not keep your Personal Data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. Your Personal Data will therefore be kept for the following periods (or, where there is no fixed period, the following factors will be used to determine how long it is kept):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For as long as you keep a paid or trial Account with Our Platform.</li>\n<li>For as long as you remain subscribed (have positively opted-in) in our emailing list and wish to receive news and offers from us.</li>\n<li>If none of the above is, then we will keep your data for a maximum period of two years following your initial communication or signup/Personal Data submission.</li>\n<li>For proper compliance with our legal, accounting and tax obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>10. How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data?</h2>\n<p>All Personal Data that you provide in order to receive the Services and use the Platform and any Online School is stored on secure Google Cloud servers located in Europe and in the U.S.A. We also share your data with external third parties, as detailed below, and some are based outside of the EEA. The following safeguards are applied to such transfers:</p>\n\n<p>We will only transfer your Personal Data to countries that the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate level of Personal Data protection.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we use specific agreements and standard contractual clauses with external third parties that are approved by the European Commission for the transfer of Personal Data to third countries. These specific agreements and standard contractual clauses ensure the same levels of Personal Data protection that would apply under the GDPR.</p>\n\n<p>Please contact us using the details below in Part 14 for further information about the particular data protection mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data to a third country.</p>\n\n<p>The European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and ruled that US ensures an adequate level of protection for processing of personal data comparable to that of the European Union.This means European entities are able to transfer data to self-certified businesses in the US without having to put in place additional data protection safeguards. Following the above, please note that all of our subprocessors are included in the Data Privacy Framework list.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from these developments, LearnWorlds continues to apply standard contractual clauses (SCCs). Additionally, we\u2019ve specifically assessed the risks raised by the Court of Justice of the European Union and determined that those risks are highly unlikely for LearnWorlds as theoretical <b>applications</b> of Executive Order 12333 and the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are unlikely to impact LearnWorlds in any way since the services we offer are not in the following sectors (e.g., telecommunication providers, ISPs, military etc) therefore the data we process should be of no interest to the U.S. intelligence community. So far no surveillance request has been received, and if we receive such a request, we shall notify the impacted parties unless prohibited by applicable law.</p>\n\n<p>Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology; All payment data is stored by our payment processors and is never stored on our servers.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access your account and the Product, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We recommend that you not share your password and that you change it frequently.</p>\n\n<p><b>Data Security:</b> Here at LearnWorlds we take data security and privacy very seriously and we continuously look for opportunities to make improvements. Here are the measures we employ for securely storing the data you entrusted to us: <a href=\"https://www.learnworlds.com/data-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.learnworlds.com/data-security</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>11.

How Can I Access My Personal Data?</h2>\n<p>If you want to know what Personal Data We have about you, you can ask us for details of that Personal Data and for a copy of it (where any such Personal Data is held). This is known as a \u201csubject access request\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part 14. To make this as easy as possible for you, a subject access request form is available for you to use. You do not have to use this form, but it is the easiest way to tell us everything We need to know to respond to your request as quickly as possible. Please contact us at gdpr@learnworlds.com and request this form.</p>\n\n<p>There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is \u2018manifestly unfounded or excessive\u2019 (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.</p>\n\n<p>We will respond to your subject access request the soonest possible, and in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, We aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your Personal Data within that time.

How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data?\nWe will not keep your Personal Data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected.

How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data?\nAll Personal Data that you provide in order to receive the Services and use the Platform and any Online School is stored on secure Google Cloud servers located in Europe and in the U.S.A. We also share your data with external third parties, as detailed below, and some are based outside of the EEA. The following safeguards are applied to such transfers:\n\nWe will only transfer your Personal Data to countries that the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate level of Personal Data protection.\n\nAdditionally, we use specific agreements and standard contractual clauses with external third parties that are approved by the European Commission for the transfer of Personal Data to third countries. These specific agreements and standard contractual clauses ensure the same levels of Personal Data protection that would apply under the GDPR.\n\nPlease contact us using the details below in Part 14 for further information about the particular data protection mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data to a third country.\n\nThe European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and ruled that US ensures an adequate level of protection for processing of personal data comparable to that of the European Union.This means European entities are able to transfer data to self-certified businesses in the US without having to put in place additional data protection safeguards. Following the above, please note that all of our subprocessors are included in the Data Privacy Framework list.\n\nApart from these developments, LearnWorlds continues to apply standard contractual clauses (SCCs). Additionally, we\u2019ve specifically assessed the risks raised by the Court of Justice of the European Union and determined that those risks are highly unlikely for LearnWorlds as theoretical applications of Executive Order 12333 and the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are unlikely to impact LearnWorlds in any way since the services we offer are not in the following sectors (e.g., telecommunication providers, ISPs, military etc) therefore the data we process should be of no interest to the U.S. intelligence community. So far no surveillance request has been received, and if we receive such a request, we shall notify the impacted parties unless prohibited by applicable law.\n\nAny payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology; All payment data is stored by our payment processors and is never stored on our servers.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access your account and the Product, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We recommend that you not share your password and that you change it frequently.\n\nData Security: Here at LearnWorlds we take data security and privacy very seriously and we continuously look for opportunities to make improvements.

If your request is \u2018manifestly unfounded or excessive\u2019 (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.\n\nWe will respond to your subject access request the soonest possible, and in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, We aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your Personal Data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date We receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.\n\n14.
