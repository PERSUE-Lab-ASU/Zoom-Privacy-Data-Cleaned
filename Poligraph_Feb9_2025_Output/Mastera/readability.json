However, for data transfers outside of the EEA, please see the specific clause below regarding the personal data of EEA Data Subjects. To learn more about each Privacy Shield Framework, visit\u00a0the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Privacy Shield List.\nWith respect to personal data received pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Provider is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Provider may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\nIf you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at\u00a0https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.\nUnder certain conditions, more fully described on\u00a0the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.\nIn compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Provider commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact the Privacy Team at privacy@optimizely.com.\nProvider has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to our designated independent dispute resolution mechanism, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (\u201cICDR\u201d), operated by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.

The services are provided at no cost to you.\nIn the context of an onward transfer Provider has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Provider shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\nEEA Data Subjects & Transfers Outside the EEA:\nIf you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.\nThird parties to whom we provide your data may be located outside the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or they may use servers that are located outside the EEA. In that event we will ensure that adequate protection of your data is provided as required by applicable law, for instance by concluding Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission.\nThe legal bases depend on the Sites and Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:\n\nWe need it to provide or operate the Sites and Services, including to provide customer support and process your orders, requests, questions and concerns;\nIt satisfies another legitimate interest that is not overridden by your data protection interests, including our interest in:\n\ncollecting product usage, analytics and performance data relating to our Sites and the Services, in order to maintain, analyze, develop, update, and improve our products and services;\nmaintaining records of bugs, customer support requests and similar requests you file, and our response to these requests;\nusing information to personalize content and features on our Sites and the Services;\ndetecting, investigating and preventing activities that may violate our policies or applicable laws (such as fraud detection and prevention);\nmaintaining corporate or business records consistent with our retention policies and applicable laws;\nprotecting against activities that may threaten the security, integrity, or availability of our or another party\u2019s products, systems, and services; and\nfor marketing and selling our products and services, consistent with applicable laws.\n\n\nWe are processing your information to protect our legal rights;\nYou give us consent to process your personal data;\nWe need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation, such as a lawful subpoena or law-enforcement request or to fulfill the lawful instructions of our customers (when they are acting as the controller); and/or\nWe have another lawful basis for processing in accordance with applicable EU laws.\n\nIf an individual in the EEA has consented to our use of their personal information, and our processing is based on that consent, that individual has the right to withdraw their consent in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. If you object to or restrict processing, you may not be able to use the Sites and Services or certain features any longer.\nWhere we are using your information because we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so, individuals in the EEA have the right to object to that use as specified in Article 21 of the GDPR, though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Sites or Services. Provider further acknowledges that EEA data subjects have certain other rights under the GDPR, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and to request from the controller access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data, restriction of processing concerning the data subject, and data portability (in each case, as specified under the GDPR).\nWhere Provider is acting as a controller, you can initiate a request\u00a0by contacting us as specified in the \u201cContacting Us\u201d section below. Please note that these requests apply only to information that Provider holds as a \u201ccontroller.\u201d If your request relates to the personal data collected through a customer\u2019s websites or digital products, you should direct your request to the owner of that website or product. Please note that you must verify your identity and request before Provider will process your request. You may be required to provide email confirmation or other information in order for us to verify your identity.\nFinally, EEA and Swiss data subjects can contact Provider\u2019s data protection officer by emailing support@mastera.io.\nCalifornia Resident Notices\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act\nEffective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) allows consumers who are California residents, upon a verifiable consumer request, to request from a business:\n\nDelete any personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer;\nDisclose to the consumer certain information about the personal information that the business collects from the consumer; and\nDirect a business that sells personal information about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumer\u2019s personal information\n\nProvider does not sell any consumer personal information to third parties. To submit a data access or data deletion request, please contact us at support@mastera.io. Please note that these requests apply only to information that Provider holds as a \u201ccontroller.\u201d If your request relates to the personal data collected through a customer\u2019s websites or digital products, you should direct your request to the owner of that website or product. Please note that you must verify your identity and request before Provider will process your request. You may be required to provide email confirmation or other information in order for us to verify your identity. Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your rights, you will not receive discriminatory treatment by Provider.\nUnder certain circumstances, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, your valid government government issued identification, and the authorized agent\u2019s valid government issued identification to allow Provider to verify that the agent is authorized to make the request on your behalf.\nIf you have any questions about Provider\u2019s privacy policies and practices, please contact us at support@mastera.io.\nCalifornia\u2019s Shine the Light Law\nCA Civil Code \u00a7 1798.83 permits California residents to request and obtain from Provider once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom Provider may have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those third parties. As a general policy, Provider does not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes by withholding consent. Please contact us at privacy@optimizely.com if you would like to make such a request.\n\n Do Not Track and Cross-Site Tracking\n\nDo Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. At this time, we do not respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals. In addition, some of our advertising partners, and other third-party services and tools on our Site and/or the Services, may use standard technologies, such as cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons, to collect information about your internet activities across websites. You may be able to disable certain third-party cross-site tracking as described in the \u201cYour Choices\u201d section above.\n\n\n Changes to Our Privacy Policy; Notices\n\nFrom time-to-time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate changes to our products, services and companies, new technologies or industry practices, updated regulatory requirements, or for other purposes.
