<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you allow us to share the information, such as when you:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we cooperate with other companies, such as our partners, to offer joint products and services to you in connection with the Services, or when such partners sponsor or participate in our events and conferences;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When our service providers are providing services on our behalf. For example, we may use an outside platform to host portions of our Sites or to provide certain features on the Services, or we may use a credit card processing company to bill you for services you purchase. Unless otherwise expressly noted, when acting as Provider’s agents, these services providers are prohibited from using the personal information we have shared with them for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enforce our terms, agreements, policies or rules, to help protect the security, integrity and availability of our or another party’s products, systems and services; to exercise or protect the rights, property (including intellectual property), or safety of Provider, our users, or others; to comply with legal requirements; or in other cases if we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law (including in response to a lawful subpoena or other law enforcement request); and</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also share aggregated information (such as usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) for other business purposes.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cookies and Other Technologies.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;You may be able to opt-out of certain cookies, targeted advertising and other technologies.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many circumstances, you can exercise these choices yourself using the tools described above. If you cannot do so, please contact us as indicated in the “Contact Us” section below to discuss your options. We will respond to your request within 30 days. Please be aware that, if you do not allow us to collect personal information from you, we may not be able to deliver certain products, features and services to you, and some of our products and services may not work appropriately or be able to take account of your interests and preferences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Children’s Privacy</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Provider does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete the information we have stored as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us as indicated in the “Contact Us” section below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Storage and Processing</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your information may be stored and processed in – and we may transfer information to – the U.S. and other countries where Provider (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) and our advertising partners and service providers maintain systems and facilities. In addition, information that we collect about you (including personal information) may be transferred to our affiliated entities and/or to other third parties across borders and/or from your country to other countries around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge that we may transfer information to the U.S., to any country in which Provider, its advertising partners, and its service providers maintain systems or facilities, and to other countries globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, you acknowledge that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, consistent with our legal obligations governing the transfer of such data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Data Security and Integrity</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provider is concerned about the security of your data. We have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware, though, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information you transmit to Provider will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on the Site or Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, please contact us as indicated in the ‘Contact Us’ section below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Data Retention</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long we keep the personal information we collect depends on the type of information, the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and similar factors. In general, we will retain your personal information for the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy (including for as long as need to provide you or our customer with products and services), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will also retain and use your information for as long as necessary to resolve disputes and/or enforce our rights and agreements. We retain your account information for the Services for as long as your employer’s account is active and thereafter unless your employer requests deletion. Aggregated information may be stored indefinitely.</span></p>

Provider is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. However, for data transfers outside of the EEA, please see the specific clause below regarding the personal data of EEA Data Subjects. To learn more about each Privacy Shield Framework, visit&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With respect to personal data received pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Provider is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Provider may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under certain conditions, more fully described on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Privacy Shield website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Provider commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact the Privacy Team at privacy@optimizely.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provider has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to our designated independent dispute resolution mechanism, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“ICDR”), operated by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please visit the website&nbsp;</span><a href="https://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;for more information or to file a complaint. The services are provided at no cost to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the context of an onward transfer Provider has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Provider shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</span></p>
<p><b>EEA Data Subjects &amp; Transfers Outside the EEA:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third parties to whom we provide your data may be located outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or they may use servers that are located outside the EEA. In that event we will ensure that adequate protection of your data is provided as required by applicable law, for instance by concluding Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal bases depend on the Sites and Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need it to provide or operate the Sites and Services, including to provide customer support and process your orders, requests, questions and concerns;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It satisfies another legitimate interest that is not overridden by your data protection interests, including our interest in:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collecting product usage, analytics and performance data relating to our Sites and the Services, in order to maintain, analyze, develop, update, and improve our products and services;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining records of bugs, customer support requests and similar requests you file, and our response to these requests;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using information to personalize content and features on our Sites and the Services;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detecting, investigating and preventing activities that may violate our policies or applicable laws (such as fraud detection and prevention);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining corporate or business records consistent with our retention policies and applicable laws;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protecting against activities that may threaten the security, integrity, or availability of our or another party’s products, systems, and services; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for marketing and selling our products and services, consistent with applicable laws.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are processing your information to protect our legal rights;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You give us consent to process your personal data;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation, such as a lawful subpoena or law-enforcement request or to fulfill the lawful instructions of our customers (when they are acting as the controller); and/or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have another lawful basis for processing in accordance with applicable EU laws.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an individual in the EEA has consented to our use of their personal information, and our processing is based on that consent, that individual has the right to withdraw their consent in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“</span><b>GDPR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. If you object to or restrict processing, you may not be able to use the Sites and Services or certain features any longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where we are using your information because we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so, individuals in the EEA have the right to object to that use as specified in Article 21 of the GDPR, though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Sites or Services. Provider further acknowledges that EEA data subjects have certain other rights under the GDPR, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and to request from the controller access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data, restriction of processing concerning the data subject, and data portability (in each case, as specified under the GDPR).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Provider is acting as a controller, you can initiate a request&nbsp;by contacting us as specified in the “Contacting Us” section below. Please note that these requests apply only to information that Provider holds as a “controller.” If your request relates to the personal data collected through a customer’s websites or digital products, you should direct your request to the owner of that website or product. Please note that you must verify your identity and request before Provider will process your request. You may be required to provide email confirmation or other information in order for us to verify your identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, EEA and Swiss data subjects can contact Provider’s data protection officer by emailing support@mastera.io</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Resident Notices</span></p>
<p><b>California Consumer Privacy Act</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) allows consumers who are California residents, upon a verifiable consumer request, to request from a business:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delete any personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclose to the consumer certain information about the personal information that the business collects from the consumer; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct a business that sells personal information about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumer’s personal information</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provider does not sell any consumer personal information to third parties. To submit a data access or data deletion request, please contact us at support@mastera.io</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please note that these requests apply only to information that Provider holds as a “controller.” If your request relates to the personal data collected through a customer’s websites or digital products, you should direct your request to the owner of that website or product. Please note that you must verify your identity and request before Provider will process your request. You may be required to provide email confirmation or other information in order for us to verify your identity. Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your rights, you will not receive discriminatory treatment by Provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under certain circumstances, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, your valid government government issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification to allow Provider to verify that the agent is authorized to make the request on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions about Provider’s privacy policies and practices, please contact us at support@mastera.io</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>California’s Shine the Light Law</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CA Civil Code § 1798.83 permits California residents to request and obtain from Provider once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom Provider may have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those third parties. As a general policy, Provider does not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes by withholding consent. Please contact us at privacy@optimizely.com if you would like to make such a request.</span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do Not Track and Cross-Site Tracking</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. At this time, we do not respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals. In addition, some of our advertising partners, and other third-party services and tools on our Site and/or the Services, may use standard technologies, such as cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons, to collect information about your internet activities across websites. You may be able to disable certain third-party cross-site tracking as described in the “Your Choices” section above.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From time-to-time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate changes to our products, services and companies, new technologies or industry practices, updated regulatory requirements, or for other purposes. We will provide notice to you (as described below) if these changes are material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notices may be by email to the last email address you provided us, by posting notice of such change on our Site or the Services, or by other communication channels. You consent to receiving notices in these ways. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, consistent with applicable law.</span></p>
