You can create a personal identity account or an organizational identity account by creating a personal identity, creating an enterprise, an organization or joining an organization, and consolidate the same or different login credentials into the Feishu Account. Joining different organizations will generate different Feishu Account.\u200b1.1.1.2 You need to create a Feishu Account through your mobile phone number. The collection of Mobile phone number is required by relevant national laws and regulations of cyberspace real name regime. If you do not provide mobile phone number for the registration and login, we may not be able to provide you with the Service. You can use your email address bonded with your Feishu Account as login credentials. If you only browse the official website of Feishu, you do not need to register a Feishu Account and provide the above information.\u200b1.1.1.3 If you are an Authorized User, you may join the organization through the invitation code, invitation link or QR code sent by the Customer. Please be aware that the Customer may have provided your mobile phone number to Feishu when sending the invitation to you. However, your account identity under the organization will not be activated unless you confirm the invitation and log in your account identity under the organization. If you voluntarily apply to join an organization, when your application is approved, your account identity under the organization will be created and it will be activated after you log in.\u200b1.1.1.4 When you register an account under the Service on behalf of the Customer, you also need to provide the relevant information such as enterprise/organization name, industry type and staff size. To help you fill in the enterprise information more conveniently, Feishu will help you locate the region of your organization through your IP information, or you can manually select the region. If you want to obtain more features and benefits, you need to provide the basic information on behalf of the Customer, such as the subject certificate, the information related to legal representative or other types of managers and the authorization letter, so that we can help the Customer complete the verification. You should confirm that you have obtained the full authorization of such customers to sign and agree to all the terms in this Privacy Policy.\u200b1.1.1.5 Based on our cooperation with communication carriers, when you use the \u201cone-click login\u201d feature, with your explicit consent, the carriers will send your mobile phone number to us, so that we can provide you with quick login service more easily. The mobile phone number is sensitive personal information. Without it, you will not be able to register for the Service through \u201cone-click login\u201d, but it will not affect you to log in by other methods.\u200b1.1.1.6 If you forget your login password and cannot reset it by yourself, you can use the password reset feature. To ensure the security of your account, you may need to fill in relevant information for verification. When necessary, you may need to verify your identity through the real identity information verification system or other methods.\u200b1.1.2 Certification and Security\u200b1.1.2.1 When you activate live broadcasting, retrieve your account or use the features or the relevant services that require identity verification, to comply with relevant laws and regulations, keep the security for you and other users, and maintain the security and stability of features and services, you may need to provide your real identity information (real name, ID number, phone number, face recognition information etc.) to complete real-name verification. We may submit the real-name verification information you provide to competent departments or their legally authorized organization to verify the authenticity and accuracy of the information. The aforementioned information contains sensitive personal information, which you may refuse to provide. If you refuse to provide it, you may not be able to receive relevant services, but it will not affect the normal use of other features and services.\u200b1.1.2.2 In the scenario of face recognition, we will process your facial information in accordance with the Chinese \"Facial Information Processing Rules\". Additionally, we may use the mobile acceleration sensor to identify the distance and angle between the device and you, to help you complete the recognition quickly and accurately.\u200b1.1.2.3 If your device and Feishu software version support fingerprint or face unlocking function, you may turn on the lock-screen protection function so as to protect the security of account and data based on your needs. When this function is enabled, the Feishu will be automatically locked if it runs from the back end. When it is opened again, it can be unlocked by digits password, or fingerprint or face recognition. The digits password is only stored locally, isolated between different users and will not be transferred to the Feishu server. If you choose the fingerprint or face recognition unlocking method, you only need to complete the information verification on your device. Feishu only receives the verification results without collecting your fingerprint or face information itself. In addition, to improve the security of your account, for the different Feishu Accounts you hold, you may separately set up the lock screen protection, running preference, and unlocking mode for each of them.\u200b1.1.3 Public Information of Feishu Account\u200b1.1.3.1 You may fill in or set up your Profile Photo, alias, personal signature, background image and personal status as you wish. This personal data you voluntarily fill in or set up will be shown to other users. Skipping filling in or setting up such information will not affect your use of Feishu Account and service.\u200b1.1.3.2 If you are an Authorized User, your information displayed on your organization's personal business card page may be set by the Customer Administrator according to the Customer's management needs. Feishu supports the synchronous display of system status as your personal status, such as status of on-leave. So that people cooperating with you can make reasonable work arrangements in real-time communication, meeting reservation and other scenarios. With the permission of the Customer Administrator, you can turn off these features.\u200b1.2 Instant Communication\u200b1.2.1 In order to realize the transmission and display of information, ensure that new members can view all history messages anytime and anywhere when joining the group, quickly integrate into teams and projects, and improve office efficiency, Feishu will record your message and voice call status (not the content) in Feishu and synchronize them to all your logged-in devices.\u200b1.2.2 In case that a user initiates the prompt of an urgent message, in order to promote the quick touch of messages, Feishu will push the urgent SMS or make a phone call to you through the mobile phone number you have provided during your registration, so as to allow other users to remind you to check the information. In order to avoid missing the urgent calls, you can add the urgent number to the address book, for which Feishu will seek the access to the address book. If you refuse to provide authorization, you may not be able to store the urgent number, but it will not affect the normal receipt of urgent alerts or the normal use other features under the Service.\u200b1.2.3 When you save your Feishu contacts to your phone address book, Feishu will seek the access to the address book.\u200b1.2.4 If you wish to send your location information to your contacts or click on a location message sent by your contact in the instant messaging interface, Feishu will obtain your location information to show you and your contacts where you are.\u200b1.2.5 You can add or delete contacts in Feishu. We will create contact lists and group lists for you. If you are an Authorized User, we will also show you the organizational structure information of the organization you belong to.\u200b1.2.6 If you are an administrator, you can add external contacts through your phone address book. At this time, Feishu will seek the access to the phone\u2019s address book. We need to locally process the names and avatars from the address book in the client for local display purpose only. We will not transmit or store this information back to our server. The email addresses and phone numbers from the address book will be uploaded to the server in the form of hash value for friend matching. However, please rest assured that we have no access to the specific content of this information, and we will not process this information beyond the aforementioned purpose of use. The aforementioned information is sensitive information.
