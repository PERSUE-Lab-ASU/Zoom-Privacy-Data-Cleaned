Introduction</h2><p>Welcome to the website (the “Site”) of Zelta Technology, Inc. ("Zelta", “we,” “us,” or “our”). The Site contains information on Zelta's feedback analytics platform powered by state of the art AI and Natural Language Processing (the “Service”). &nbsp;This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect via the Site, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices. Before using the Site or submitting any Personal Data to Zelta, please review this Privacy Policy carefully and contact us if you have any questions. By accessing the Site, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you may not access the Site.</p><h2>II. Zelta Support</h2><p>Zelta shall provide support for the Services as set forth here; </p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Service Support</strong>. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, Zelta shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) maintain the security of the Zelta Service; and (b) provide email technical support Monday through Friday, 8am – 6pm ET, excluding US national holidays. &nbsp;Zelta will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct all Errors in the Zelta Service reported by Customer in writing to Zelta. Zelta will utilize remote diagnostic procedures whenever possible for Error diagnosis and bug fixes and/or workaround to correct the Error (“<strong><em>Error Correction</em></strong>”). Zelta may not issue Error Corrections for all Errors. &nbsp;“<strong><em>Error</em></strong>” means a reproducible failure of the Zelta Service to substantially conform to the Documentation. &nbsp;During the Term, Zelta may, in its sole discretion, provide Customer with updates, upgrades, enhancements, and any other improvements that Zelta generally offers to other customers of the Zelta Service.<strong>‍<br>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Support Exclusions</strong>. Zelta shall have no responsibility or liability of any kind, whether for breach of warranty or otherwise, arising or resulting from: (a) any problems which are not Errors; (b) problems caused by failed Internet connections or other hardware, software or equipment which is not owned, controlled or operated by Zelta; (c) nonconformities resulting from misuse, abuse, negligence, or improper or unauthorized use of all or any part of the Zelta Services, Zelta Platform, or Documentation; (d) problems or Errors caused by Customer’s, Named Users’, or other third party’s products, services or equipment. &nbsp;Any use of or reliance on data or data output contained in the Zelta Services is Customer’s or Named User’s sole responsibility.<strong>‍<br>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Service Availability</strong>. &nbsp;The Zelta Service will, subject to the exceptions listed below, be available [99.5]% of the time during any full calendar month (“<strong><em>Scheduled Availability</em></strong>”). &nbsp;The Scheduled Availability of the Zelta Service for a given month will be calculated as follows (rounded to the nearest one tenth of one percent): Availability % = 100% x (Total Minutes in the Month – Total Minutes Unavailable in the Month)/Total Minutes in the Month. Scheduled Availability Time does not include: (i) scheduled maintenance downtime; (ii) maintenance downtime for specific critical Services issues; and (iii) any downtime due to defects caused by Customer, one of its vendors, third party connections, utilities, or caused by other forces beyond the control of Zelta (such as internet outages or outages with respect to Customer’s network or internet access). &nbsp;Zelta shall use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice by email of any scheduled service disruption.<strong>‍<br>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Services Credit</strong>. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Zelta's entire liability, in connection with any unexcused downtime shall be that for each period of downtime lasting longer than four hours, Zelta will credit Customer 5% of the Fees for each incident; provided that no more than one such credit will accrue per month. Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as Customer (with notice to Zelta) recognizes that downtime is taking place, and continues until the availability of the Zelta Service is restored. &nbsp;In order to receive downtime credit, Customer must notify Zelta in writing within 24 hours from the time of downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit. &nbsp;Such credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not be cumulative beyond a total of credits for one (1) month of Fees in any one (1) calendar month in any event. &nbsp;Zelta will only apply a credit to the month in which the incident occurred. &nbsp;Zelta's blocking of data communications or other services in accordance with its policies shall not be deemed to be a failure of Zelta to provide adequate service levels under this Agreement.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h2>III.
