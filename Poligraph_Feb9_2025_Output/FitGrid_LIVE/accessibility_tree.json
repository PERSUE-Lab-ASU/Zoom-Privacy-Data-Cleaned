We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through our partners. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the setting on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. Cookies When you visit our website or otherwise interact with the Service we (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may send one or more \u201ccookies\u201d to your computer or other devices. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers stored on your computer through your web browser and are used by most websites to help personalize your web experience. Some cookies may facilitate additional site features for enhanced performance and functionality such as remembering preferences, allowing social interactions, analyzing usage for site optimization, providing custom content, allowing third parties to provide social sharing tools, and serving images or videos from third party websites. Some features on this site will not function if you do not allow cookies. We may link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interest of our users to enhance the experience of our Services. Web Beacons We (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may use Web Beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about our Service or other information we or they have collected. Web Beacons are tiny graphic objects that are embedded in a web page or email and are usually invisible to the user but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or email. Web Beacons may be used within the Service to track email open rates, web page visits or form submissions. In some cases, we tie the information gathered by Web Beacons to our users\u2019 personal Information. Flash and HTML5 Storage We use Local Shared Objects, such as Flash cookies, AND/OR Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we may partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your browsing activity also use Flash cookies or HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click here. Analytics Software We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies on our services. These companies may collect information about how you use our Services and other websites over time and across different Services. The information that may be collected could include, among other things, internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity. We also use Google Analytics which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Service and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google\u2019s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

Advertising Networks We may partner with third party data or ad network(s) and other service providers to show you relevant ads, including ads displayed on the Service and on other companies\u2019 websites or apps, on any of your devices. We and our service providers may use cookies and web beacons to deploy and read cookie identifiers and Mobile Ad IDs, associated with your activities on the Service, third party web sites, mobile apps or other information we collect, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. They may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. These ad networks and their customers may also use any of this information to measure ad performance, understand their (or our) audience, or otherwise improve and enhance their marketing. Similarly, we or a third-party data partner may associate cookies with hashed (non-human readable) versions of your registration data (e.g. your e-mail address), along with other interest-based or demographic data. You can learn more about or opt out of this type of advertising through the links in the following paragraph. Mobile Opt Out: Your mobile operating system may let you opt-out from having your information collected or used for interest-based advertising on mobile devices. You should refer to the instructions provided by your mobile device\u2019s manufacturer; this information is typically available under the \u201csettings\u201d function of your mobile.
