The purpose of this Policy is to make clear what information we collect from you, how we use and disclose this information, and the ways in which you can help manage the information we collect.</p><h3>Application of this Policy</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.smarttech.com/en/legal/sls-terms\">Click here for SMART Learning Suite\u2019s Terms and Privacy Policy.</a></p><p>This Policy applies to all websites (including smarttech.com), applications (including mobile), products and services offered by SMART (collectively \u201c<strong>Services</strong>\u201d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Services may have additional and/or specific privacy terms that relate only to such Service.

For example, if you are a SMART amp user, certain information may need to be provided by you or SMART to third party service providers (including those involved in hosting user content) in order to facilitate your use of such product.

We do not knowingly collect any information from individuals under the age of 18 without such consent.</p><p>We only collect personal information through our Services from a child under 18 where that student\u2019s school, district, and/or teacher has confirmed to us that they have obtained the requisite, verifiable parental or guardian consent for that child to disclose personal information to us. If you are under 18 please do not send us any personal information unless your school, district, and/or teacher has obtained the necessary parental or guardian consents. For more information regarding school, district and teacher responsibility to collect consents please see the applicable Service terms of use or license agreement.</p><p>In the case of Services where SMART stores or manages student personal information, such as SMART amp, information that is, to our knowledge, provided to us by someone under 18 not in accordance with these requirements will be deleted where possible (it may not be possible, for instance, to delete such information where it is embedded in a collaborative work product created using the Services).
