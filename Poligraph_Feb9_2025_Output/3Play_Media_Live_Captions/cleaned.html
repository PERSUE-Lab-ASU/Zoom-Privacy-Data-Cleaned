<div class="container">

		<h2 id="section-what">1. WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your use of the Service, we may collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.</span></p>
<h3><b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Such information may include your name, address, business address, company, job title, e-mail address, telephone number, IP address, device identification, account name(s), records of Service purchased (for billing and account management), country, audio recordings of customer calls, audio and visual recordings of webinars, any feedback you submit to us through the Site or Service (including through a survey conducted by us or on our behalf), any other information you choose to share with us (such as through webforms), any information submitted by you through the Site as part of a job application form, and the contents of any source materials you upload onto the Service. Additionally, our Outside Contractor (as defined below) that is responsible for billing and payment processing services (the “Payment Services Provider”) may collect your billing and credit card information from you directly. Personally identifiable information amounts to ‘personal data’ for the purposes of and as defined in the European Data Protection Laws (to the extent applicable). All references to personally identifiable information shall be deemed to include ‘personal data’ as defined and used in the European Data Protection Laws (to the extent applicable).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may collect from you, or you may make available to us some special categories of personal data in the contents of any source materials you upload onto the Service. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you explicitly consent to the processing of any such special categories of personal data. “Special categories of personal data” consist of personal data for the purposes of and as defined in the European Data Protection Laws which is to be treated with particular sensitivity, and includes information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic or biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the extent the contents of any source materials you upload onto the Service includes personally identifiable information relating to any person other than yourself, you represent, warrant, and covenant that: (i) you have (and will have) provided any notice and obtained all consents and rights required by applicable law to enable us to lawfully process such personally identifiable information as permitted by this Privacy Policy; (ii) you have (and will have) full right and authority to make such personally identifiable information available to us; and (iii) our processing of such personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy will not infringe upon or violate any applicable laws or any rights of any third party.</span></p>
<h3><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, including non-identifiable demographic information, user agent (including browser types), behavioral usage analytics, unique device identifiers, device types, application specific identifiers, information about computer hardware and software (such as computer type and screen resolution), requested URL, referring URL, browser language, the pages you view, the date and time of your visit, domain names, web page analytics, usage information, and statistical data involving the use of the Site and/or Service, such as web page activity, links clicked, and videos watched. Certain non-personally identifiable information may be considered a part of your personally identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified. However, the same pieces of information are considered non-personally identifiable information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personally identifiable information (for example, your viewing preferences) in a way that would not enable you to be identified.</span></p>

<div class="container">

		<h2 id="section-where">2. WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES AND ACTION TAGS)?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will collect personally identifiable information that you submit to us. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties, including Industry Partners, the Payments Services Provider, third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of your use of the Service, and providers of lead generation services. And, we may directly collect personally identifiable information about you that is publicly available from sources such as LinkedIn and other publicly available websites, and we may combine such information with other information we have about you.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Registering to Use the Service and in the Course of Using the Service.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be required to establish an account in order to take advantage of certain features of the Service. If so, if you wish to establish an account you will be required to provide us with information (including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information) such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and account name(s), and including credit card and billing information submitted directly to the Payment Services Provider. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of the registration process. In addition, we may obtain your personally identifiable information from you if you identify yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments. Also, we will have access to any personally identifiable information that you choose to share through the Service.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Cookies and Action Tags.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may collect information passively using “cookies” and “action tags.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cookies” are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your web browser and the activities of your computer on the Service and other websites. Cookies can be used to personalize your experience on the Service (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using the Service (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name each time you use the Service), to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Service to help us improve our offerings, or to determine the popularity of certain content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to cookies that we may place on your computer or mobile device, cookies might also be placed on your computer or mobile device by third parties that we use to provide analytics services. In the course of providing such services, such third-party service providers could place or recognize unique cookies on your browser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not have to accept cookies to use the Service. Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the “Help” section of the toolbar. However, if you reject cookies, certain features or resources of the Service may not work properly or at all and you may experience some loss of convenience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the avoidance of doubt, the Service may use third-party service platforms (including to help analyze how users use the Service). These third-party service platforms may place cookies on your computer or mobile device. If you would like to disable “third-party” cookies, you may be able to turn them off by going to the third party’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are links to the main third-party platforms we use:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Action tags,” also known as pixels, web beacons, or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Service, including email sent on our behalf, may contain action tags.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve the Service, track when emails have been opened and which links in an email have been clicked, and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We may also combine information collected from cookies to information that you may provide, such as information provided in a form that you complete. Information collected from cookies (including cookies placed by third-party vendors, such as Google and its partners) may be used to deliver advertisements to Site visitors when such visitors are visiting other websites, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. You may opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thenai.org/opt-out/"><b>https://thenai.org/opt-out/</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Finally, you should be aware that third parties may use their own cookies or action tags when you click on a link to their websites or services on or from the Service. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use of cookies or action tags or the use of your information by such third-party websites or services.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Log Files.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also collect information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Service. This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Service, to monitor the use of the Service, and to gather general demographic information. We may link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes such as personalizing your experience on the Service and evaluating the Service in general.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Public Areas.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Service may feature various community areas, chat functionality, profile pages, blogs, message boards, and other public forums (the “Public Areas”) where Service users with similar interests can share information or where members can post questions for others to answer. These Public Areas are open to the public and should not be considered private. We cannot prevent information included within a Public Area from being used in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy. We are not responsible for the results of such postings or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings.</span></p>
<p><b>Any information you share in a Public Area (including personally identifiable information) is by design open to the public and is not private. You should think carefully before posting any information in any Public Area. What you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by others and may be used by others in ways we cannot regulate or predict. As with any public forum on any website, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN, and Bing. If you mistakenly post personally identifiable information in a Public Area you can send us an e-mail to request that we remove it by contacting us at&nbsp;</b><a href="mailto:privacy@3playmedia.com"><b>privacy@3playmedia.com</b></a><b>. You should understand that in some cases, we may not be able to remove your information.</b></p>

		<h2 id="section-third-parties">6. WHEN DOES 3PLAY MEDIA DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We generally disclose information we gather from you through the Service or in connection with Networking Activities to the following types of third parties and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically authorized by you.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Industry Partners.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share your information with our trusted partners (“Industry Partners”) who work on our behalf or with whom we collaborate or whose events we may attend. These partners may use your information to communicate with you directly, including for their own marketing purposes, or help us communicate with you. In particular, we may share your information, including your name, company, job title, telephone number, e-mail, and/or country, with our Industry Partners with whom we co-host or jointly sponsor marketing initiatives and events, such as webinars, downloadable content, conferences or Networking Activities, who may communicate with you directly, including for their own marketing purposes.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Laws and Legal Rights.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose your information (including personally identifiable information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or other valid legal process. We may disclose personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating a contract with us, to detect fraud, for assistance with a delinquent account, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, the Service or the general public.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Third Parties Generally.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may provide to third parties non-personally identifiable information, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of the Service. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who use the Service, the demographic breakdown of our users of the Service, or the products and/or services purchased using the Service and the vendors of such products and services. In addition to the above, when users use our Service, third parties (including third-party analytics service providers and commercial partners) may directly collect personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about our users’ online activities over time and across different websites. The third parties to which we may provide or who may independently directly collect personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information may include providers of analytics services (including vendors, analytics services providers, and website tracking services).</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Ad Management Providers and Ad Networks.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may work with third parties to manage our advertising on third-party websites, including serving or tracking advertisements relating to the Service. We may also work with third-party ad networks who may target advertisements to you based on your information. The privacy policies of those third parties will govern your interactions with those third-party websites or ad networks. These ad networks may make inferences based on this information in order to provide targeted ads. They may collect and aggregate information about you or make inferences based on your information to serve targeted ads to you. Many ad networks have joined the Digital Advertising Alliance’s self-regulatory program to provide a single opt-out available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://youradchoices.com/"><b>https://youradchoices.com/</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) provides a similar opt-out available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://youronlinechoices.eu/"><b>https://youronlinechoices.eu/</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Outside Contractors.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to the Service, such as hosting and maintaining the Service, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, including the Payment Services Provider, and developing applications for the Service, and related to our Networking Activities. In the course of providing products or services to us, these Outside Contractors may have access to information collected through the Service, including your personally identifiable information. We use reasonable efforts to ensure that these Outside Contractors are capable of protecting the security of your personally identifiable information. Please note in particular that the Service uses Google Analytics, including its data reporting features. Information collected by Google Analytics includes but is not limited to web metrics. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please see the site “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”, currently located at </span><a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"><b>www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h3><b><i>Sale of Business.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in connection with a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of 3Play Media or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined below), or that portion of 3Play Media or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in connection with a strategic investment by a third party in 3Play Media, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Affiliates.</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose information (including personally identifiable information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy: “Corporate Affiliate” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with 3Play Media Inc., whether by ownership or otherwise; and “control” means possessing, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management, policies or operations of an entity, whether through ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting securities, by contract or otherwise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want your information (including personally identifiable information) to remain secure. We strive to provide transmission of your information from your computer or mobile device to our servers through techniques that are consistent with commercially reasonable standards and to employ administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notwithstanding the above, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally identifiable information collected on the Service may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and the Service may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such information. By using the Service and submitting such information on it, or by engaging in Networking Activities with us you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information. Without limitation of the foregoing, you hereby expressly grant consent to the 3Play Media to: (a) process and disclose such information (including special categories of personal data) in accordance with this Privacy Policy; (b) transfer such information (including special categories of personal data) throughout the world, including to the United States or other countries that do not ensure adequate protection for personally identifiable information (as determined by the European Commission or the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, as applicable, each, an “Inadequate Jurisdiction”) and/or countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such information; and (c) disclose such information (including special categories of personal data) to comply with lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent required by applicable law: whenever we transfer your personal data (as defined in the European Data Protection Laws) to third parties (as described in this Privacy Policy) located in an Inadequate Jurisdiction, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it; we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission or the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, as applicable, which give personal data the same protection it has in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, as applicable, under the European Data Protection Laws; and if we rely on another basis to transfer your personal data to an Inadequate Jurisdiction, we will keep you updated or contact you if required. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanisms used by us when transferring your personal data to an Inadequate Jurisdiction. If you are a user accessing the Service from a jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from those of the United States, please be advised that all aspects of the Service are governed by the internal laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA, regardless of your location.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To determine the appropriate retention period for personally identifiable information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of that information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process your personally identifiable information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</span></p>

		<h2 id="section-choices">11. WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We generally use personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy or as authorized by you or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You generally must “opt in” and give us permission to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. You may also change your preference and “opt out” of receiving certain marketing communications from us by following the directions provided in association with the communication or such other directions we may provide or by contacting&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:privacy@3playmedia.com"><b>privacy@3playmedia.com</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under certain circumstances and in compliance with the European Data Protection Laws, you may have the right to:</span></p>
<p><b>Request access</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;to your personally identifiable information (commonly known as ‘subject access request’). This enables you to receive a copy of the personally identifiable information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;</span></p>
<p><b>Request correction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;of the personally identifiable information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;</span></p>
<p><b>Request erasure</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;of your personally identifiable information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your personally identifiable information where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove all of your personally identifiable information in certain circumstances;</span></p>
<p><b>Object to processing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;of your personally identifiable information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground;</span></p>
<p><b>Request the restriction of processing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;of your personally identifiable information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personally identifiable information, for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it;</span></p>
<p><b>Request the transfer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;of your personally identifiable information to another party; and</span></p>
<p><b>Lodge a complaint</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;with the relevant supervisory authority (as defined in the European Data Protection Laws). If you have any complaints about the way we process your personally identifiable information, please do contact us. Alternatively, you may lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority which is established in your country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personally identifiable information, object to the processing of your personally identifiable information, or request that we transfer a copy of your personally identifiable information to another party, please contact&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:privacy@3playmedia.com"><b>privacy@3playmedia.com</b></a> or <a href="mailto:dsr@3playmedia.com"><b>dsr@3playmedia.com</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should be aware that it may not be technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your personally identifiable information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. After receiving your request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to update, correct, change, or delete, as appropriate, all personally identifiable information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably practicable.</span></p>
<h3><b>DO NOT TRACK</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term “Do Not Track” refers to a HTTP header offered by certain web browsers to request that websites refrain from tracking the user. We take no action in response to automated Do Not Track requests. However, if you wish to stop such tracking, please contact us with your request, using our contact details provided below.</span></p>

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf (such as an authorized agent), may make a verifiable consumer request related to your consumer information. Someone legally authorized to act on your behalf (such as an authorized agent) may make a verifiable consumer request on your behalf, provided that you have duly authorized that person or entity to make such a verifiable consumer request on your behalf and provided that that person or entity can provide verification of their authority to make such a request on your behalf where required. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability no more than twice within a twelve (12) month period. The verifiable consumer request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected consumer information or an authorized agent; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with consumer information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the consumer information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use consumer information provided for the purposes of verification of a consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. We use the following process to verify consumer requests: In the event you make a request under this Section 14, we may take various approaches to verify your identity depending on the nature of your request. These approaches may include initiating telephone calls with you or reaching out to by e-mail or otherwise to ask you questions pertaining to the information we have about you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14.6.2 We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we may deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your consumer information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. If your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify you of the reason for refusing the request.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>14.7</b> <b>Non-Discrimination</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CPRA rights, including, unless permitted by the CPRA, by:</span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><b>14.8</b> <b>Consumer Information Retention</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will only retain your consumer information (including sensitive consumer information) for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. To determine the appropriate retention period for consumer information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of that consumer information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process your consumer information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</span></p>
