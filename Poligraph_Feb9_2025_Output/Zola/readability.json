These third-party sites and services may have their own privacy policies, which you should review. We are not responsible for the terms or policies of websites or services that we do not own or control. The inclusion of a link on the Website does not imply Zola's endorsement of the linked site or service.</p><p><b>Jurisdictional Issues.</b> Zola is a U.S. company. Our Website/Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than those of the United States.

DATA SECURITY </h3><p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. To protect the information delivered to us electronically, our Website uses Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS encrypts your payment information, name and postal address so only our payment processors, as applicable, are able to decode your information. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Website, and you do so at your own risk.  </p><p>We urge you to create a strong password that is unique to Zola, and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.

These third-party sites and services may have their own privacy policies, which you should review. We are not responsible for the terms or policies of websites or services that we do not own or control. The inclusion of a link on the Website does not imply Zola's endorsement of the linked site or service.Jurisdictional Issues. Zola is a U.S. company. Our Website/Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than those of the United States.

DATA SECURITY We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. To protect the information delivered to us electronically, our Website uses Transport Layer Security (TLS).

Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Website, and you do so at your own risk.  We urge you to create a strong password that is unique to Zola, and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. You are responsible for securing your account credentials for any activities that occur under your account.IX.
