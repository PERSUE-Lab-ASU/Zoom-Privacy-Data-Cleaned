        <span class="font-bold">Notifiable Data Breaches</span>
          </p><div class="pb-3">
        A notifiable data breach scheme is currently in place in Australia.  We are committed to adhering to this scheme as an important step in preventing and managing serious privacy breaches. A "data breach" means unauthorised access to, or disclosure, alteration, loss, or destruction of, personal information ‚Äîor, an action that prevents us from accessing personal information on either a temporary or permanent basis.  An "eligible data breach", in accordance with the Australian Privacy Act, occurs when there is a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm to any of the individuals to whom the information relates and we are unable to prevent the likely risk of serious harm with remedial action.

    </div>
    <div class="pb-3">
          We, including all our people, take breaches of privacy very seriously.  If we suspect a privacy breach has occurred, our priority is to contain and assess the suspected breach.  In doing so, we will:
    <ol class="ml-6 list-lower-alpha">
          <li>take any necessary immediate action to contain the breach and reduce the risk of harm;</li>

          <li>determine the cause and extent of the breach;</li>

          <li>consider the types of information involved, including whether the personal information is sensitive in nature;</li>

          <li>analyse the nature of the harm that may be caused to affected individuals;</li>

          <li>consider the person or body that has obtained or may obtain personal information as a result of the breach (if known); and</li>

          <li>determine whether the personal information is protected by a security measure.</li>

    </ol>

    </div>
    <div class="pb-3">
        If we believe an eligible data breach has occurred we will, as soon as practicable, notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and all affected individuals or, if it is not possible to notify affected individuals, provide public notice of the breach (in a manner that protects the identity of affected individuals).
