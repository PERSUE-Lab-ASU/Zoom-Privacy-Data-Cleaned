We also use cookies as part of the Services,\n              for example to operate the booking for our Customers, or to keep you logged into your account and store\n              your preferences.\n            We also use cookies to serve targeted ads from Google, Facebook, Bing, and other\n              third-party advertising tools.\n            These third-party advertising tools use cookies to track your prior visits to our\n              websites and elsewhere on the Internet in order to serve you targeted ads.\n            Opting out: You can opt out of targeted ads served via specific third party\n              vendors by visiting the Digital\n                Advertising Alliance.\n            We may also use web beacons, tracking technology and other automated tracking\n              methods on our websites, in communications with you, and in our products and services, to measure\n              performance and engagement as well as offer our Services.\n            Please note that \"Do Not Track\" signals from your browser may lead to\n              reduced or inactivity of Service functionality and or an unsatisfactory user experience and in order to\n              make sure we offer the best Service we do not alter our data collection when we detect such signals.\n            Cookies are stored on your device to assist us in providing and improving our\n              Services. For example, we use cookies to keep you logged into your account and we use data collection\n              devices such as Google Analytics to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness and\n              to provide you with information relevant to your interests.\n            Through first-party and third-party cookies, third parties may collect information\n              about you while you are visiting Setster-hosted booking pages and other websites.

These\n              applications are all available within the Setster Service. Setster is not responsible for and has no\n              control over how these applications function. Customers ultimately can control which applications they\n              choose and are responsible for making sure that they do so in compliance with relevant privacy and data\n              protection requirements.\n          \n          7. What do we do with your personal information, and how long do we keep it?\n          \n            How long we retain your personal data depends on the type of data and the purpose for which we process the data. We will\n            retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless\n            a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\n            In general, we will continue to store archived copies of your personal information for legitimate business purposes and\n            to comply with the law, except when we receive a valid erasure request or, if you are a Customer, you terminate your\n            account and your information is purged pursuant to our standard process.\n            We will continue to store anonymous or anonymized information, such as website visits, without identifiers, in order to\n            improve our Services.\n          \n          8. What we don\u2019t do with your personal information\n          \n            We do not and will never share, disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide\n              personal information to other companies, other than to specific Setster Customers you are interacting with,\n              or to Third Party Applications being used by the Customers you are interacting with for the marketing of\n              their own products or services, or application used to offer this Service as a whole.\n            If you are a Customer using Setster\u2019s Services, we do not use the personal\n              information we collect from you or your Clients to independently contact or market to your Clients.\n              However, Setster may contact or market to your Clients if we obtain their information from another source,\n              such as from the Client themselves (for example, if they contact us directly requesting support or\n              information regarding our Service).\n          \n          9. How do we keep your personal information secure?\n          \n            We follow industry standards on information security management to safeguard\n              sensitive information. Our information security systems apply to people, processes and information\n              technology systems on a risk management basis.\n            Though we have implemented these measures designed to secure your personal\n              information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of storage is 100% secure. Therefore,\n              we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. You acknowledge that you provide\n              your personal information at your own risk and that you're not obliged to do so.\n          \n          10. Residents of the European Economic Area (\"EEA\")\n          Setster works with Customers, Clients and Users around the world, including in the\n            EEA. If you are located in the EEA, be advised your personal information is processed by Setster in the\n            United States of America. As part of our Service, we may transfer your personal information to other regions.\n          If you are located in the EEA, you have certain rights under European law with\n            respect to your personal data, including the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, or limit the\n            use of your personal data. If you are a Customer, or a Visitor of Setster\u2019s websites and wish to exercise\n            these rights, please reach out to us using the contact information below. If you are a Client who interacted\n            with Customers and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the Customers you interacted with directly\n            -- we serve as a processor on their behalf and can only forward your request to them to allow them to\n            respond.\n          Additionally, if you are located in the EEA, we note that we are generally\n            processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an\n            appointment through the service), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above,\n            unless we are required by law to obtain your consent for a particular processing operation.\n          11. Residents of California\n          \n            The California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") - effective as of January 1, 2020 - regulates how we handle personal\n            information of California residents and gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal\n            information. Setster is both a \"business\" and a \"service provider\" under the CCPA. This section of the privacy policy\n            applies to information we collect in our role as a business - this is when we interact directly with you.

If you would like\n            more information about how your personal information is processed by other companies, including companies that engage us\n            as a service provider, please contact those companies directly.\n          \n          \n            California law requires us to disclose certain information regarding the categories of personal information we collect.\n            The following is a list of all categories of personal information which Setster collects, or has collected, from\n            California Residents, in the twelve (12) months prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy.\n          \n          Information We May Collect:\n          \n            We may collect the following categories of information:\n          \n          \n            Identifiers\n            Demographic Information\n            Financial Information\n            Commercial Information\n            Internet or other electronic network activity information\n            Geolocation data\n            Audio, electronic, visual, or similar information\n            Professional or employment-related information\n            Other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you\n          \n          \n            For each category of information, we collect data from a variety of sources, including directly from you, from your\n            devices, from your social media profiles, and/or from third party providers.

Please be as specific as\n            possible in relation to the personal information you wish to access.
