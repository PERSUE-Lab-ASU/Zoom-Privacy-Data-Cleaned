          <ul class="unordered-second-list w-list-unstyled">
            <li class="disc-list-item">We follow industry standards on information security management to safeguard
              sensitive information. Our information security systems apply to people, processes and information
              technology systems on a risk management basis.</li>
            <li class="disc-list-item">Though we have implemented these measures designed to secure your personal
              information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of storage is 100% secure. Therefore,
              we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. You acknowledge that you provide
              your personal information at your own risk and that you're not obliged to do so.</li>

          <p class="legal-paragraph">Setster works with Customers, Clients and Users around the world, including in the
            EEA. If you are located in the EEA, be advised your personal information is processed by Setster in the
            United States of America. As part of our Service, we may transfer your personal information to other regions.</p>
          <p class="legal-paragraph">If you are located in the EEA, you have certain rights under European law with
            respect to your personal data, including the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, or limit the
            use of your personal data. If you are a Customer, or a Visitor of Setster’s websites and wish to exercise
            these rights, please reach out to us using the contact information below. If you are a Client who interacted
            with Customers and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the Customers you interacted with directly
            -- we serve as a processor on their behalf and can only forward your request to them to allow them to
            respond.</p>
          <p class="legal-paragraph">Additionally, if you are located in the EEA, we note that we are generally
            processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an
            appointment through the service), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above,
            unless we are required by law to obtain your consent for a particular processing operation.<br></p>
          <h2 class="legal-h2">11. Residents of California</h2>
          <p class="legal-paragraph">
            The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") - effective as of January 1, 2020 - regulates how we handle personal
            information of California residents and gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal
            information. Setster is both a "business" and a "service provider" under the CCPA. This section of the privacy policy
            applies to information we collect in our role as a business - this is when we interact directly with you. When we act as
            a service provider (for example, by providing our services to another company that you interact with), we follow the
            instructions of the business that engaged us with respect to how we process your personal information. If you would like
            more information about how your personal information is processed by other companies, including companies that engage us
            as a service provider, please contact those companies directly.
          </p>
          <p class="legal-paragraph">
            California law requires us to disclose certain information regarding the categories of personal information we collect.
            The following is a list of all categories of personal information which Setster collects, or has collected, from
            California Residents, in the twelve (12) months prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy.

            verify your identity, we will let you know. We will respond to your request within 45 days of receipt, or notify you if
            we require additional time.

            interacted with a Customer, and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the Customers you interacted
            with directly -- we serve as a processor on their behalf and can only forward your request to them to allow
