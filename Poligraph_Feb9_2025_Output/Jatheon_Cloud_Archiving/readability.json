We generally retain your data for an indefinite period of time.\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\nIn some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\nYou can ask us to delete your data in some circumstances. See below for further information.\nWhat are your rights?\nUnder certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:\n\nRequest access to your personal data\nRequest correction of your personal data\nRequest erasure of your personal data\nObject to processing of your personal data\nRequest restriction of processing your personal data\nRequest transfer of your personal data\nRight to withdraw consent\n\nExercising your rights\nIf you wish to exercise any of your rights set out above, please email us at dpo@jatheon.com.\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
