How we collect information</h2><p>Broadly, there are two methods we use to collect your personal information:</p><h3>(a) Information that you specifically give us</h3><p>In some instances, you must provide personal information if you wish to receive a particular service or participate in an activity.</p><p>You may choose to provide some personal information that is not required but is directly related to our functions and activities. This type of information will usually enable us to improve or broaden the services we offer you. If you choose not to provide this optional information, we would still be able to offer you the service although it may be with fewer options than if you had provided the optional information.</p><p>If you provide us with unsolicited information that we do not require or that is not directly related to our functions or activities, we may be required to destroy or de-identify that information, provided it is lawful and reasonable to do so.</p><p>In some instances, you will be asked to confirm that you agree to a particular activity such as expressly agreeing that you would like to receive our newsletter or other marketing communications. You can always opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email or by visiting our email subscription management page here (www.squiz.net/unsubscribe).</p><p>We may use third parties to collect your personal information on our behalf but the collection and processing of that personal data will still be on the terms set out in this Privacy Notice.</p><h3>(b) Automatic collection</h3><p>When you browse our website, we collect information as set out in the table above in order to improve user experience and to keep the website secure.</p><p>We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'. Cookies do not contain information by which we can identify you \u2013 they only identify your computer to our servers.</p><h2>4. Cookies used on the site</h2><p>For further information about cookies, please see our Cookie Notice <a href=\"https://www.squiz.net/legal/cookie-notice\">here</a>.</p><h2>5. How long do we keep your information?</h2><p>We will retain your information for as long as necessary for the uses set out in this Privacy Notice. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and any applicable requirements which may relate to any legal, regulatory, accounting, reporting, insurance, professional indemnity, internal policy or other obligations. If you ask us to delete your information before that time, we may not be able to do so, due to legal or regulatory constraints. For example, we would need to retain your name and contact details for suppression purposes if you do not want to receive direct marketing from us.</p><p>If we withdraw a product or service, such as an online forum, we may either archive or delete the information you have provided to it.</p><h2>6. Who has access to your information?</h2><p>We may share your personal information within the wider Squiz group of companies, and we will do so via an intra-group agreement containing relevant data protection requirements. <br>Otherwise, we do not share personal information with other companies, organisations and individuals unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p><ul><li>on your request \u2013 we will share your personal information when we have your consent to do so;</li><li>third-party suppliers who provide services to us for example for delivery services, agencies which send direct marketing on our behalf, software providers or market research agencies. We may also use suppliers to collect your information on our behalf but the use of your information will still be subject to this Privacy Notice;</li><li>business partners and affiliates;</li><li>for legal reasons; or</li><li>if we sell part or all of our business, customer information may be one of the transferred business assets. If this happens, your information may be disclosed to any successors of our business for them to use for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice.</li></ul><p>Where we provide you with a service that is dependent on age or residency and we have an obligation to verify this information then we may pass your details to a third party to carry out the verification for us.</p><p>We will only disclose your information to third-party companies for their own purposes, including marketing their products and services when we have a legal basis to do so. In most cases, this would require your prior consent.</p><h2>7. Information transfers</h2><p>When you provide us with your information or use our services, we may transfer your information to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other members of the Squiz group or to third parties in another country (including outside the European Economic Area) but will do so with appropriate measures and controls in place to protect that information in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. You have a right to request a copy of the appropriate measures we put in place.</p><h2>8. Third-party information</h2><p>When you give us information about another person, you confirm that they have agreed that you can share their information with us and have given them a copy of this Privacy Notice.</p><h2>9. User access and controls</h2><div><p>You have several rights in relation to your personal information which will depend on your location and the relevant data protection laws that are applicable. In certain circumstances these rights may not be absolute, which we can discuss with you further where relevant. You are not required to pay a charge in most circumstances for exercising your rights and we generally have one month to respond to your request. </p><p>We ask for proof of ID where we need to confirm the identity of the individual making the request.</p></div><p>You can make such a request to exercise any of your data subject rights by sending us an email to privacy@squiz.net or your Account Manager or Business Development Manager.</p><p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to access personal information</p><p>You may request a copy of your personal information from any Squiz group company which may hold personal information about you (we expect in all but exceptional circumstances to carry this out free of charge). You can also ask us to correct any inaccuracies in your personal information (which is free) though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p><p>If particular circumstances apply, we are permitted by the Australian Privacy Act or other relevant data protection law to deny your request for access or limit the access we provide. We will let you know why your request is denied or limited.</p><p>(b) Right to erase personal information</p><p>You have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law.</p><p>If you ask us to delete your information, we may not be able to do so, due to technical, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. For example, we need to retain your name and contact details for suppression purposes if you do not want to receive direct marketing from us.</p><p>If you ask for your account to be closed, we will do this as soon as is reasonably possible subject to any applicable terms and conditions relating to the account. Personal information from closed accounts is retained in order to comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed or to resolve disputes.</p><p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to object to processing of your personal information</p><p>You have the right to object to processing where we are relying on our legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p><p>(d) Right to restrict the processing of your personal information</p><p>This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios:</p><p>(i) if you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy; <br>(ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; <br>(iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or <br>(iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p><p>(e) Right to data portability</p><p>You have the right to request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p><p>(f) Right to withdraw consent to processing</p><p>You have the right to withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you (or the business you work for). We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p><p>(g) Right to complain</p><p>We welcome the opportunity to attend to any of your concerns or complaints about the way in which we handle your personal data, however you also have the right to make a complaint at any time:</p><ul><li>in the UK, to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues: https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/</li><li>in the EEA, to the applicable supervisory authority for your country, a full list of whom is available at: https://www.edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en</li><li>in Australia, to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), the Australian supervisory authority for data protection issues: https://www.oaic.gov.au/contact-us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in New Zealand, to the Privacy Commissioner:</li><li>https://www.privacy.org.nz/your-rights/making-a-complaint-to-the-privacy-commissioner/ <br>For California residents, see the section below \"Additional Information for California Residents\"</li></ul><p>(h) Updating your information</p><p>Please ensure you update your personal information or tell us if it changes or is inaccurate.

How we collect informationBroadly, there are two methods we use to collect your personal information:(a) Information that you specifically give usIn some instances, you must provide personal information if you wish to receive a particular service or participate in an activity.You may choose to provide some personal information that is not required but is directly related to our functions and activities. This type of information will usually enable us to improve or broaden the services we offer you. If you choose not to provide this optional information, we would still be able to offer you the service although it may be with fewer options than if you had provided the optional information.If you provide us with unsolicited information that we do not require or that is not directly related to our functions or activities, we may be required to destroy or de-identify that information, provided it is lawful and reasonable to do so.In some instances, you will be asked to confirm that you agree to a particular activity such as expressly agreeing that you would like to receive our newsletter or other marketing communications. You can always opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email or by visiting our email subscription management page here (www.squiz.net/unsubscribe).We may use third parties to collect your personal information on our behalf but the collection and processing of that personal data will still be on the terms set out in this Privacy Notice.(b) Automatic collectionWhen you browse our website, we collect information as set out in the table above in order to improve user experience and to keep the website secure.We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'. Cookies do not contain information by which we can identify you \u2013 they only identify your computer to our servers.4. Cookies used on the siteFor further information about cookies, please see our Cookie Notice here.5. How long do we keep your information?We will retain your information for as long as necessary for the uses set out in this Privacy Notice. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and any applicable requirements which may relate to any legal, regulatory, accounting, reporting, insurance, professional indemnity, internal policy or other obligations. If you ask us to delete your information before that time, we may not be able to do so, due to legal or regulatory constraints. For example, we would need to retain your name and contact details for suppression purposes if you do not want to receive direct marketing from us.If we withdraw a product or service, such as an online forum, we may either archive or delete the information you have provided to it.6. Who has access to your information?We may share your personal information within the wider Squiz group of companies, and we will do so via an intra-group agreement containing relevant data protection requirements. Otherwise, we do not share personal information with other companies, organisations and individuals unless one of the following circumstances applies:on your request \u2013 we will share your personal information when we have your consent to do so;third-party suppliers who provide services to us for example for delivery services, agencies which send direct marketing on our behalf, software providers or market research agencies. We may also use suppliers to collect your information on our behalf but the use of your information will still be subject to this Privacy Notice;business partners and affiliates;for legal reasons; orif we sell part or all of our business, customer information may be one of the transferred business assets. If this happens, your information may be disclosed to any successors of our business for them to use for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice.Where we provide you with a service that is dependent on age or residency and we have an obligation to verify this information then we may pass your details to a third party to carry out the verification for us.We will only disclose your information to third-party companies for their own purposes, including marketing their products and services when we have a legal basis to do so. In most cases, this would require your prior consent.7. Information transfersWhen you provide us with your information or use our services, we may transfer your information to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other members of the Squiz group or to third parties in another country (including outside the European Economic Area) but will do so with appropriate measures and controls in place to protect that information in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.

User access and controlsYou have several rights in relation to your personal information which will depend on your location and the relevant data protection laws that are applicable. In certain circumstances these rights may not be absolute, which we can discuss with you further where relevant. You are not required to pay a charge in most circumstances for exercising your rights and we generally have one month to respond to your request. We ask for proof of ID where we need to confirm the identity of the individual making the request.You can make such a request to exercise any of your data subject rights by sending us an email to privacy@squiz.net or your Account Manager or Business Development Manager.(a)\u00a0\u00a0Right to access personal informationYou may request a copy of your personal information from any Squiz group company which may hold personal information about you (we expect in all but exceptional circumstances to carry this out free of charge).

You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law.If you ask us to delete your information, we may not be able to do so, due to technical, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. For example, we need to retain your name and contact details for suppression purposes if you do not want to receive direct marketing from us.If you ask for your account to be closed, we will do this as soon as is reasonably possible subject to any applicable terms and conditions relating to the account.
