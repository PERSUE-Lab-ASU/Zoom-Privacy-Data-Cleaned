The laws regarding the notice, notification, and consent requirements for recording conversations vary from state to state. In some states, you are required to obtain consent from all parties to a record a conversation. You are solely responsible for complying with all federal, state, and local laws in any relevant jurisdiction when using this feature. Dialpad expressly disclaims all liability with respect to your recording of telephone conversations. You hereby agree to fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, hold harmless, and fully indemnify Dialpad from and against any damages or liabilities of any kind related to your recording of any telephone conversations using the Services.</p><h3>Transcribing Calls</h3><p>Note that the laws applicable to call transcription differ by state, province and country. For some jurisdictions, transcribing recorded calls, recording calls, or even transcribing real-time speech over a call or video is prohibited or requires informed consent by some or all parties to the conversation. We recommend you review the relevant laws of your locality or consult with an attorney regarding your specific circumstances. Dialpad expressly disclaims all liability with respect to your transcription of telephone conversations. You hereby agree to fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, hold harmless, and fully indemnify Dialpad from and against any damages or liabilities of any kind related to your transcription of any telephone conversations using the Services.</p><h3>Voice-to-text and Text-to-voice Limitations</h3><p>Certain Dialpad Services may provide a function that allows voicemails and voice notes to be converted to text and vice versa. You understand and agree that Dialpad\u2019s voice-to-text (\u201cVTT\u201d) and text-to-voice (\u201cTTV\u201d) features may not accurately transcribe voicemails or articulate text messages, respectively.

Dialpad expressly disclaims all liability with respect to the conversion of voicemails to text or vice versa. You hereby agree to fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, hold harmless, and fully indemnify Dialpad from and against any damages or liabilities of any kind related to your use of VTT or TTV features when using the Services.</p><h3>Support and Feedback</h3><p>Dialpad may provide customer and technical support to you via telephone, chat, forums, FAQ and email for the Services. The types of support provided by Dialpad is dependent on the products that you purchased and the number of seats using Dialpad in your organization. The types of support provided by Dialpad is determined entirely by Dialpad in its sole discretion and may change from time to time. Dialpad does not make any representations or guarantees that Dialpad will be able to fully resolve any issues reported by you. Except as provided in this section, Dialpad has no obligation to provide additional customer support, technical support, or to provide solutions (e.g., bug fixes to software) to any issues that may arise in your particular use of the Services.</p><p>From time to time, Dialpad may send you surveys, comment cards, customer satisfaction forms, or other requests to provide feedback. You hereby grant Dialpad, its licensors, and suppliers a perpetual, unlimited, worldwide fully-paid up, royalty free license to use all feedback, answers, ideas, comments, or other information you provide to Dialpad.</p><h3>Number Porting and Availability</h3><p>Dialpad will use reasonable efforts to facilitate number transfers or port requests for you, provided that You comply with the necessary and specific procedures for porting between service providers. You acknowledge and understand that number porting depends on the cooperation of third parties outside of Dialpad\u2019s control. Accordingly, you agree that Dialpad will not be liable for the failure or delay of any third party to cooperate in the porting of any telephone number, or for the allegedly unauthorized porting of any telephone number by a third party.</p><p>Dialpad works with third party carrier(s) who, on Dialpad\u2019s behalf, port telephone numbers in accordance with applicable regulatory rules and industry guidelines. Dialpad\u2019s third-party carrier(s) require very specific and detailed information and requirements when completing a port request. Please be informed that you will be required to provide such detailed and specific information to complete a port request. For porting numbers into your Dialpad account, follow the procedures on your account settings page for transferring a number to your Dialpad account. For porting numbers out of your Dialpad account, follow the procedures of your new service provider. You understand that porting your number out of your Account does not automatically terminate your Dialpad account.</p><p>Dialpad cannot guarantee requested telephone numbers will be available, that your existing provider will port your number, or that circumstances beyond Dialpad\u2019s control will not prevent or delay a successful port of your number for the Services. You should not order any printed material, such as business cards or stationery, showing a telephone number, or issue any press releases or otherwise publicize any telephone number until that telephone number becomes active on your Account. Dialpad shall not be liable for reimbursement for press releases, business cards, and/or stationery under any conditions.</p><p>You understand and agree that Dialpad may from time to time need to change the telephone number assigned to you (due to an area code split or for any other reason). Dialpad shall not be liable for any damages (including consequential, special damages or other damages) to you in the event that it needs to assign you a new telephone number.</p><h3>Dialpad 911 Service</h3><p>FOR USERS OF DIALPAD FREE, ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES (911) IS NOT AVAILABLE. BY USING DIALPAD FREE SERVICES, INCLUDING PORTING YOUR EXISTING NUMBERS TO DIALPAD FREE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO REACH 911 AND THAT YOU WILL INFORM ALL BUSINESS COLLEAGUES, HOUSEHOLD RESIDENTS, GUESTS, AND OTHER PERSONS WHO MAY BE PRESENT AT YOUR PHYSICAL LOCATION THAT 911 IS UNAVAILABLE THROUGH DIALPAD FREE.</p><p>FOR SUBSCRIBERS OF DIALPAD PAID SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 911 SERVICE IS ONLY PROVIDED THROUGH THE DIALPAD DESKTOP APP OR THE DIALPAD SOFTPHONE DUE TO THE NATURE OF DIALPAD 911 SERVICE AND SERVICE PORTABILITY DISCUSSED BELOW, WE RECOMMEND YOU MAKE ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO PLACE 911 CALLS, SUCH AS USING A TRADITIONAL WIRELINE OR CELLULAR TELEPHONE, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON DIALPAD TO CALL 911.</p><p>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE DIALPAD MOBILE APPLICATION USES YOUR DEVICE\u2019S DIALER AND CELLULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE TO MAKE 911 CALLS. IF YOUR DEVICE DOES NOT HAVE CELLULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CALL 911 FROM THE DIALPAD MOBILE APPLICATION. DIALPAD DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATING TO YOUR (OR ANY OF YOUR USERS OR THIRD PARTIES) INABILITY TO MAKE 911 CALLS OR ACCESS EMERGENCY SERVICES.</p><p>Dialpad VoIP 911 Service (\u201cDialpad 911 Service\u201d) operates differently than traditional 911 service. We are required by the FCC to advise you of the circumstances under which 911 may not be available or may be in some way limited by comparison to traditional 911 service. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, Internet Connection Failure, Number Flexibility &amp; Porting, and Loss of Electrical Power (as described below):</p><ul><li><p><u>Internet connection failure.</u> If the connection to the wired broadband internet over which your Dialpad Service is provided is interrupted, you would not have access to Dialpad Service during that interruption and therefore will not have access to Dialpad 911 Service during that interruption.</p></li><li><p><u>Number Flexibility &amp; Service Portability.</u> Traditional 911 service automatically sends your 911 call to the appropriate local emergency responder, or Public Safety Answering Point (\u201cPSAP\u201d), based on your telephone number. Traditional Enhanced 911 service (also known as E911) automatically sends your 911 call to the appropriate PSAP along with your registered address and telephone number. Because the Dialpad Service permits you to obtain a telephone number that does not correspond to your geographic location (for example, you may obtain a Dialpad telephone number with a California area code even if you do not have a California address) and allows you to use Dialpad Service anywhere you have wired broadband Internet, the Dialpad 911 Service functions differently than traditional 911 service in certain respects: Because your address does not necessarily correspond with your telephone number, you must provide Dialpad with the street address(es) where you will be using Dialpad Service (\u201cRegistered Location(s)\u201d) when you sign up for Dialpad service. If you relocate any equipment (e.g., PC with softphone, IP phone, or ATA with traditional phone) that you use to access the Dialpad Service, you must update your Registered Location(s). If you do not update your Registered Location(s), any 911 calls you make using the Dialpad Service will be routed based on your previously provided Registered Location and therefore may not be routed to the appropriate PSAP for your new location. In addition, because the Dialpad Service will, where possible, automatically transmit your Registered Location to the PSAP, you must update your Registered Location to ensure that the Dialpad Service transmits accurate location information to the PSAP. Once you notify us of a change in your Registered Location, there may be a delay in making the new Registered Location available to properly route 911 calls and advise PSAPs of your new Registered Location. In some parts of the country where direct routing to PSAPs is not available for Dialpad 911 Service, the Service will route your call to the National Emergency Call Center where trained agents will ask for the name, location, and telephone number of the person calling 911 and will contact the appropriate PSAP to send help. The call center will not automatically receive your address and telephone number. In these situations, public safety response times may be delayed. As a result, there may be an additional delay before emergency services arrive.</p></li><li><p><u>Loss of Electrical Power.</u> Unless you have a backup system to power your wired broadband Internet connection and any equipment (PC with softphone, IP phone, ATA with traditional phone) that You use to access your Dialpad Service, you will not have phone service or 911 service during any power outage.</p></li></ul><p><u>Registration of Physical Locations Required.</u>&nbsp;As discussed above, you must register the Registered Location where you will be using Dialpad Service for each phone line you use from Dialpad (e.g., if you purchase Dialpad with three lines, you must provide a Registered Location for each of the three lines). Dialpad will obtain your Registered Location as part of the service initiation process and will not provide Dialpad Service until you have provided your initial Registered Location. However, you must update your Registered Location when you use your Dialpad Service from a new location. Regardless of what address you register, in some circumstances, such as unavailability of direct routing to PSAPs or the use of portable devices to access the Dialpad Service, emergency calls will be routed to the National Emergency Call Center.</p><p><br>You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete Registered Location information to Dialpad as part of the service initiation process and to update as soon as possible your Registered Location with true, accurate, current, and complete information whenever you use your Dialpad Service from a new location. If you provide Registered Location information that is, or that Dialpad suspects to be, false, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, Dialpad has the right to suspend or terminate the Services and refuse any and all current or future use of all Services, or any portion thereof. Dialpad will not, however, disable your ability to make a 911 call during any service suspension.</p><p>You may update your Registered Location by logging on to your account settings page or contacting Dialpad customer support at&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"mailto:customersuccessteam@dialpad.com\">customersuccessteam@dialpad.com</a>. For purposes of 911 dialing, you may only register one Registered Location for each Dialpad line.</p><p><u>Notify All Users of 911 Limitations.</u>&nbsp;You must inform all business colleagues, household residents, guests, and other persons who may be present at the physical location where you utilize the Dialpad Service that 911 may not be available or may be in some way limited in comparison to traditional 911 service. For subscribers to whom E911 service is provided as part of their Dialpad Services, stickers may be sent with warning that \u201cE911 Service May Be Limited or Not Available\u201d for use with any equipment purchased from Dialpad. It is your responsibility to place these stickers on the equipment you use to access Dialpad Service. If you have not received a sticker, or you require additional 911 stickers, please contact customer support at&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"mailto:customersuccessteam@dialpad.com\">customersuccessteam@dialpad.com</a>.</p><p><u>Disclaimer of 911 Liability.</u>&nbsp;Dialpad disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of PSAPs, the National Emergency Call Center, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. Dialpad does not have any control over PSAPs, the National Emergency Call Center, or other third parties and is therefore not responsible for whether they answer 911 calls made using the Dialpad Service, how they answer these calls, or how they handle or respond to these calls. Dialpad relies on third parties to assist it in the provision of 911 service and disclaims any and all liability for acts or omissions by third parties in the provision of Dialpad\u2019s 911 service. Dialpad expressly disclaims all liability with respect to your use of the E911 service. You hereby agree to fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, hold harmless, and fully indemnify Dialpad from and against any damages or liabilities of any kind related to your use of the E911 services.</p><h3>Operator Assisted Calling, 311, 511, and Other X11 Calling</h3><p>The Service does not support 0+ or operator assisted calling (including, without limitation, collect calls, third party billing calls, 900, or calling card calls). The Service may not support 311, 411, 511, and/or other X11 calling (other than 911 and 711 as specified in this Agreement) in one or more service areas.</p><h3>Fraudulent Activity or Erroneous Changes</h3><p>In the event of suspected fraudulent activity or erroneous charges on your Account, you agree to contact Dialpad as soon as possible. In many cases, Dialpad can mitigate or correct fraudulent activity or erroneous charges without bank or credit card company intervention. If you suspect fraudulent activity or erroneous charges on your Dialpad account, please contact Dialpad customer support at&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"mailto:customersuccessteam@dialpad.com\">customersuccessteam@dialpad.com</a>. When you contact customer support, please have the following information available: (a) your name, contact information, the Dialpad account telephone number in question, and security verification information; (b) the credit card account number associated with the account; and (c) the total amount in question charged to the account. If you do not contact Dialpad within thirty (30) days after the suspected fraudulent activity or erroneous charges appear on your Account, you waive your rights to object to or challenge such activity or charges. Furthermore, if you request that your bank or credit card company perform a chargeback without first contacting Dialpad, and Dialpad subsequently determines that the charges at issue are not erroneous, Dialpad reserves the right to terminate your account immediately and take any available legal action. Notwithstanding the above, you are solely liable for any transactions or activities by you or anyone else that occur on your Account, and in no event shall Dialpad be liable for any unauthorized use of your Account.</p><h3>AUP Breach</h3><p>In the event that you breach any of the terms of this AUP, Dialpad retains the right to suspend or terminate Customer\u2019s use of the Dialpad Services (including Dialpad Ai Meetings) upon written notice to you.

For example, we use suppliers for webhosting, secure cloud storage, analytics, email delivery, customer relationship management, and other services.</p><p>Disclosure of Personal Data to these sub-processors is limited to what is strictly required for the sub-processor to perform the service it provides.</p><p>These disclosures of Personal Data are either necessary for the purpose of performing our contract with you or necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests (that are to provide, maintain, improve, secure, and promote our Services).</p><p>We only disclose Personal Data to sub-processors in accordance with a written contract and based upon a lawful basis.</p><p>Our sub-processors may change over time, but Dialpad maintains an up-to-date list of sub-processors <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.dialpad.com/subprocessors/\">here</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sub-Processors (Controllers)</p></td><td><p>In a few rare circumstances, our sub-processors may act as an independent controller of Personal Data.

Where we are processing your information on our own behalf as a controller, we may disclose your information with your consent, which we may obtain in several ways, including:</p><ul><li><p>In writing;</p></li><li><p>Verbally;</p></li><li><p>Online, by clicking on a link or button; or,</p></li><li><p>Other mechanisms.</p></li></ul><p>Our Services permit you to submit information which may be displayed to other authorized users in the same or different Customer Account.

In such a case, Dialpad only makes such cross-border transfers according to applicable laws. For example, to transfer data outside of the EEA or the UK, our Data Processing Agreement (which is available for signature within the Admin Portal of existing customers) incorporates the EU and UK Standard Contractual Clauses and supporting documents, as applicable, or other inter-company agreements. For transfers out of other jurisdictions operating transfer restriction regimes, we take similar steps to ensure compliance with local law.</p><h3>Data Retention</h3><p>In accordance with applicable data protection laws, we do not store your Personal Data for longer than needed for the purposes of the respective processing activity.</p><p>Dialpad, by default, will retain your data for as long as your account is active. Upon closure of your account, Dialpad will automatically delete your data within 180 days of account termination. You always have the right to implement a customizable retention policy that will delete data routinely based on your specific retention requests.

Your use of Dialpad\u2019s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporates this Copyright Dispute Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service.</p><p><em>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements</em>. If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to Dialpad\u2019s Designated Agent (contact details are listed below):</p><ol><li><p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;</p></li><li><p>Identification of works or materials being infringed;</p></li><li><p>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Dialpad is capable of finding and verifying its existence;</p></li><li><p>Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number, and email address;</p></li><li><p>A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the identified infringing material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p></li><li><p>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</p></li></ol><p><em>Procedure Following Dialpad\u2019s Receipt of Bona Fide Infringement Notification</em>.

By accessing or using our APIs, you are agreeing to the Terms below. If there is a conflict between these Terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</p><p>Under the Terms, \"Dialpad\" means Dialpad, Inc., located at 2700 Camino Ramon Suite 490 San Ramon, CA 94583. In addition, Dialpad has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities. These companies may provide the APIs to you on behalf of Dialpad and the Terms will also govern your relationship with these companies.</p><h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3><p>a. You may accept the Terms and use the APIs only if (a) you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Dialpad. If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity.</p><p>b. In order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide information as part of the registration process. Any registration information you give to Dialpad should always be accurate and kept up to date.</p><h3>2. Using the APIs</h3><p>a. You will comply (and will require your end users to comply) with all applicable laws, regulations, and third party rights (including, without limitation, laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, and local laws). You will not violate any other terms of service with Dialpad (or its affiliates).</p><p>b. You will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. If Dialpad assigns you developer credentials, you must use them with the applicable APIs. You will not misrepresent or hide either your identity or your API Client's identity when using the APIs or developer accounts.</p><p>c. Dialpad sets and enforces limits on your use of the APIs (including limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve), in its sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations. If you would like to use an API beyond these limits, you must obtain Dialpad's express consent. To seek such consent, contact the relevant Dialpad API team for information.</p><p>d. Some of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with Dialpad for the applicable open source software.</p><p>e. We may send you certain communications in connection with your use of the APIs. Please review the applicable API documentation for information about opting out of certain types of communication. If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.</p><p>f. The Terms are non-exclusive. You acknowledge that Dialpad may develop products or services that may compete with your API Clients or any other products or services.</p><p>g. To the extent required by data protection laws applicable to the parties' processing of personal data under these Terms, the parties agree to the Dialpad&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/r6vlh4dr9f5y/2fCkAgEdRQSJVhmi8nAifo/2d95c8e73cf4c4b2951d69d890bd19bc/Dialpad_Data_Processing_Agreement.pdf\">Data Processing Agreement</a>, as described in Dialpad\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p><h3>3. Prohibitions</h3><p>When using the APIs, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):</p><p>a. Sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties.</p><p>b. Perform an action with the intent of introducing to Dialpad products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature.</p><p>c. Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.</p><p>d. Interfere with or disrupt the APIs or the servers or networks providing the APIs.</p><p>e. Promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements.</p><p>f. Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.</p><p>g. Use the APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems).</p><p>h. Use the APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State.</p><p>i. Remove, obscure, or alter any Dialpad terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.</p><p>j. Encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights</p><h3>4. Termination</h3><p>a. You may stop using our APIs at any time with or without notice. If you want to terminate the Terms, you must provide Dialpad with prior written notice and upon termination, cease your use of the applicable APIs. Dialpad reserves the right to terminate the Terms with you or discontinue the APIs or any portion or feature or your access thereto, for any reason and at any time, without liability or other obligation to you.</p><p>b. Upon any termination of the Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API, cease all use of Dialpad Brand Features, and delete any cached or stored content. Dialpad may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API.</p><p>c. When the Terms come to an end, those terms that by their nature are intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including but not limited to: Sections 4b, 5, 8, 9, and 10.</p><h3>5. Your API clients</h3><p>a. The APIs are designed to help you enhance your websites and applications (\"API Client(s)\"). YOU AGREE THAT DIALPAD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE DIALPAD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include Dialpad accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect Dialpad or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Dialpad may use any technical means to overcome such interference. Dialpad may suspend access to the APIs by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.</p><p>b. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personal data, from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.</p><p>c.

User privacy and API clients</h3><p>a.

You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your API Client that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information (including for advertising) with Dialpad and third parties.</p><p>b. Unless otherwise specified in writing by Dialpad, Dialpad does not intend use of the APIs to create obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (\"HIPAA\"), and makes no representations that the APIs satisfy HIPAA requirements. If you are (or become) a \"covered entity\" or \"business associate\" as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the APIs for any purpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information to Dialpad unless you have received prior written consent to such use from Dialpad.</p><h3>7. Confidentiality</h3><p>a. Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.</p><p>b. Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Dialpad confidential information. Dialpad confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you may not disclose it to any third party without Dialpad's prior written consent. Dialpad confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose Dialpad confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.</p><h3>8. Content</h3><p>a. Our APIs may contain third party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content. Content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.</p><p>b. Some of our APIs allow the submission of content. Dialpad does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in the Terms.</p><p>c. For the sole purpose of enabling Dialpad to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and only in accordance with the applicable Dialpad privacy policies, you give Dialpad a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to Use content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. \"Use\" means use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.</p><p>d. When a user's non-public content is obtained through the APIs, you may not expose that content to other users or to third parties without explicit opt-in consent from that user.</p><p>e. Dialpad supports data portability. For as long as you use or store any user data that you obtained through the APIs, you agree to enable your users to export their equivalent data to other services or applications of their choice in a way that's substantially as fast and easy as exporting such data from Dialpad products and services, subject to applicable laws, and you agree that you will not make that data available to third parties who do not also abide by this obligation.</p><p>d. Unless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law, you will not, and will not permit your end users or others acting on your behalf to, do the following with content returned from the APIs:</p><ul><li><p>Scrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of such content, or keep cached copies longer than permitted by the cache header;</p></li><li><p>Copy, translate, modify, create a derivative work of, sell, lease, lend, convey, distribute, publicly display, or sublicense to any third party;</p></li><li><p>Misrepresent the source or ownership; or</p></li><li><p>Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of material.</p></li></ul><h3>9. Brand features; Attribution</h3><p>a. \"Brand Features\" is defined as the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of each party. Except where expressly stated, the Terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party's Brand Features. All use by you of Dialpad's Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) inures to the benefit of Dialpad.</p><p>b. Dialpad hereby grants to you a nontransferable, nonsublicenseable, nonexclusive license while the Terms are in effect to display Dialpad's Brand Features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the APIs. You must only use the Dialpad Brand Features in accordance with the Terms and for the purpose of fulfilling your obligations under this Section.</p><p>c. You will not make any statement regarding your use of an API that suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by Dialpad without Dialpad's prior written approval.</p><p>d. In the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the APIs you are using and the associated Dialpad products, Dialpad may produce and distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, video, or other content from your API Client, and may use your company or product name. You grant us all necessary rights for the above purposes.</p><h3>10. Privacy and copyright protection</h3><p>a. By using our APIs, Dialpad may use submitted information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p><p>b. We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but we can't determine whether something is being used legally or not without their input. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Dialpad's policy about responding to notices in our&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://help.dialpad.com/\">Help Center</a>.</p><h3>11.

General provisions</h3><p>a. We may modify the Terms or any portion to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our APIs. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will post notice of modifications to the Terms within the documentation of each applicable API, to this website, and/or in the Dialpad developers console. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. But changes addressing new functions for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for an API, you should discontinue your use of that API. Your continued use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.</p><p>b. The APIs were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency supplements thereto.</p><p>d. Except as set forth below: (i) the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the APIs and (ii) ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE APIS WILL BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF SAN FRANCISCO CITY AND COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, USA, AND YOU AND DIALPAD CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN THOSE COURTS.</p><p>d.

You acknowledge and understand that number porting depends on the cooperation of third parties outside of Dialpad\u2019s control. Accordingly, you agree that Dialpad will not be liable for the failure or delay of any third party to cooperate in the porting of any telephone number, or for the allegedly unauthorized porting of any telephone number by a third party.Dialpad works with third party carrier(s) who, on Dialpad\u2019s behalf, port telephone numbers in accordance with applicable regulatory rules and industry guidelines. Dialpad\u2019s third-party carrier(s) require very specific and detailed information and requirements when completing a port request. Please be informed that you will be required to provide such detailed and specific information to complete a port request. For porting numbers into your Dialpad account, follow the procedures on your account settings page for transferring a number to your Dialpad account. For porting numbers out of your Dialpad account, follow the procedures of your new service provider. You understand that porting your number out of your Account does not automatically terminate your Dialpad account.Dialpad cannot guarantee requested telephone numbers will be available, that your existing provider will port your number, or that circumstances beyond Dialpad\u2019s control will not prevent or delay a successful port of your number for the Services. You should not order any printed material, such as business cards or stationery, showing a telephone number, or issue any press releases or otherwise publicize any telephone number until that telephone number becomes active on your Account. Dialpad shall not be liable for reimbursement for press releases, business cards, and/or stationery under any conditions.You understand and agree that Dialpad may from time to time need to change the telephone number assigned to you (due to an area code split or for any other reason). Dialpad shall not be liable for any damages (including consequential, special damages or other damages) to you in the event that it needs to assign you a new telephone number.Dialpad 911 ServiceFOR USERS OF DIALPAD FREE, ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES (911) IS NOT AVAILABLE. BY USING DIALPAD FREE SERVICES, INCLUDING PORTING YOUR EXISTING NUMBERS TO DIALPAD FREE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO REACH 911 AND THAT YOU WILL INFORM ALL BUSINESS COLLEAGUES, HOUSEHOLD RESIDENTS, GUESTS, AND OTHER PERSONS WHO MAY BE PRESENT AT YOUR PHYSICAL LOCATION THAT 911 IS UNAVAILABLE THROUGH DIALPAD FREE.FOR SUBSCRIBERS OF DIALPAD PAID SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 911 SERVICE IS ONLY PROVIDED THROUGH THE DIALPAD DESKTOP APP OR THE DIALPAD SOFTPHONE DUE TO THE NATURE OF DIALPAD 911 SERVICE AND SERVICE PORTABILITY DISCUSSED BELOW, WE RECOMMEND YOU MAKE ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO PLACE 911 CALLS, SUCH AS USING A TRADITIONAL WIRELINE OR CELLULAR TELEPHONE, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON DIALPAD TO CALL 911.YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE DIALPAD MOBILE APPLICATION USES YOUR DEVICE\u2019S DIALER AND CELLULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE TO MAKE 911 CALLS. IF YOUR DEVICE DOES NOT HAVE CELLULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CALL 911 FROM THE DIALPAD MOBILE APPLICATION. DIALPAD DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATING TO YOUR (OR ANY OF YOUR USERS OR THIRD PARTIES) INABILITY TO MAKE 911 CALLS OR ACCESS EMERGENCY SERVICES.Dialpad VoIP 911 Service (\u201cDialpad 911 Service\u201d) operates differently than traditional 911 service. We are required by the FCC to advise you of the circumstances under which 911 may not be available or may be in some way limited by comparison to traditional 911 service. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, Internet Connection Failure, Number Flexibility & Porting, and Loss of Electrical Power (as described below):Internet connection failure. If the connection to the wired broadband internet over which your Dialpad Service is provided is interrupted, you would not have access to Dialpad Service during that interruption and therefore will not have access to Dialpad 911 Service during that interruption.Number Flexibility & Service Portability. Traditional 911 service automatically sends your 911 call to the appropriate local emergency responder, or Public Safety Answering Point (\u201cPSAP\u201d), based on your telephone number. Traditional Enhanced 911 service (also known as E911) automatically sends your 911 call to the appropriate PSAP along with your registered address and telephone number. Because the Dialpad Service permits you to obtain a telephone number that does not correspond to your geographic location (for example, you may obtain a Dialpad telephone number with a California area code even if you do not have a California address) and allows you to use Dialpad Service anywhere you have wired broadband Internet, the Dialpad 911 Service functions differently than traditional 911 service in certain respects: Because your address does not necessarily correspond with your telephone number, you must provide Dialpad with the street address(es) where you will be using Dialpad Service (\u201cRegistered Location(s)\u201d) when you sign up for Dialpad service. If you relocate any equipment (e.g., PC with softphone, IP phone, or ATA with traditional phone) that you use to access the Dialpad Service, you must update your Registered Location(s). If you do not update your Registered Location(s), any 911 calls you make using the Dialpad Service will be routed based on your previously provided Registered Location and therefore may not be routed to the appropriate PSAP for your new location. In addition, because the Dialpad Service will, where possible, automatically transmit your Registered Location to the PSAP, you must update your Registered Location to ensure that the Dialpad Service transmits accurate location information to the PSAP. Once you notify us of a change in your Registered Location, there may be a delay in making the new Registered Location available to properly route 911 calls and advise PSAPs of your new Registered Location. In some parts of the country where direct routing to PSAPs is not available for Dialpad 911 Service, the Service will route your call to the National Emergency Call Center where trained agents will ask for the name, location, and telephone number of the person calling 911 and will contact the appropriate PSAP to send help. The call center will not automatically receive your address and telephone number. In these situations, public safety response times may be delayed. As a result, there may be an additional delay before emergency services arrive.Loss of Electrical Power. Unless you have a backup system to power your wired broadband Internet connection and any equipment (PC with softphone, IP phone, ATA with traditional phone) that You use to access your Dialpad Service, you will not have phone service or 911 service during any power outage.Registration of Physical Locations Required.\u00a0As discussed above, you must register the Registered Location where you will be using Dialpad Service for each phone line you use from Dialpad (e.g., if you purchase Dialpad with three lines, you must provide a Registered Location for each of the three lines). Dialpad will obtain your Registered Location as part of the service initiation process and will not provide Dialpad Service until you have provided your initial Registered Location. However, you must update your Registered Location when you use your Dialpad Service from a new location. Regardless of what address you register, in some circumstances, such as unavailability of direct routing to PSAPs or the use of portable devices to access the Dialpad Service, emergency calls will be routed to the National Emergency Call Center.You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete Registered Location information to Dialpad as part of the service initiation process and to update as soon as possible your Registered Location with true, accurate, current, and complete information whenever you use your Dialpad Service from a new location. If you provide Registered Location information that is, or that Dialpad suspects to be, false, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, Dialpad has the right to suspend or terminate the Services and refuse any and all current or future use of all Services, or any portion thereof. Dialpad will not, however, disable your ability to make a 911 call during any service suspension.You may update your Registered Location by logging on to your account settings page or contacting Dialpad customer support at\u00a0customersuccessteam@dialpad.com. For purposes of 911 dialing, you may only register one Registered Location for each Dialpad line.Notify All Users of 911 Limitations.\u00a0You must inform all business colleagues, household residents, guests, and other persons who may be present at the physical location where you utilize the Dialpad Service that 911 may not be available or may be in some way limited in comparison to traditional 911 service. For subscribers to whom E911 service is provided as part of their Dialpad Services, stickers may be sent with warning that \u201cE911 Service May Be Limited or Not Available\u201d for use with any equipment purchased from Dialpad. It is your responsibility to place these stickers on the equipment you use to access Dialpad Service. If you have not received a sticker, or you require additional 911 stickers, please contact customer support at\u00a0customersuccessteam@dialpad.com.Disclaimer of 911 Liability.\u00a0Dialpad disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of PSAPs, the National Emergency Call Center, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. Dialpad does not have any control over PSAPs, the National Emergency Call Center, or other third parties and is therefore not responsible for whether they answer 911 calls made using the Dialpad Service, how they answer these calls, or how they handle or respond to these calls. Dialpad relies on third parties to assist it in the provision of 911 service and disclaims any and all liability for acts or omissions by third parties in the provision of Dialpad\u2019s 911 service. Dialpad expressly disclaims all liability with respect to your use of the E911 service. You hereby agree to fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, hold harmless, and fully indemnify Dialpad from and against any damages or liabilities of any kind related to your use of the E911 services.Operator Assisted Calling, 311, 511, and Other X11 CallingThe Service does not support 0+ or operator assisted calling (including, without limitation, collect calls, third party billing calls, 900, or calling card calls). The Service may not support 311, 411, 511, and/or other X11 calling (other than 911 and 711 as specified in this Agreement) in one or more service areas.Fraudulent Activity or Erroneous ChangesIn the event of suspected fraudulent activity or erroneous charges on your Account, you agree to contact Dialpad as soon as possible. In many cases, Dialpad can mitigate or correct fraudulent activity or erroneous charges without bank or credit card company intervention. If you suspect fraudulent activity or erroneous charges on your Dialpad account, please contact Dialpad customer support at\u00a0customersuccessteam@dialpad.com. When you contact customer support, please have the following information available: (a) your name, contact information, the Dialpad account telephone number in question, and security verification information; (b) the credit card account number associated with the account; and (c) the total amount in question charged to the account. If you do not contact Dialpad within thirty (30) days after the suspected fraudulent activity or erroneous charges appear on your Account, you waive your rights to object to or challenge such activity or charges. Furthermore, if you request that your bank or credit card company perform a chargeback without first contacting Dialpad, and Dialpad subsequently determines that the charges at issue are not erroneous, Dialpad reserves the right to terminate your account immediately and take any available legal action. Notwithstanding the above, you are solely liable for any transactions or activities by you or anyone else that occur on your Account, and in no event shall Dialpad be liable for any unauthorized use of your Account.AUP BreachIn the event that you breach any of the terms of this AUP, Dialpad retains the right to suspend or terminate Customer\u2019s use of the Dialpad Services (including Dialpad Ai Meetings) upon written notice to you. No credits will be available for terminations or suspensions resulting from Customer\u2019s breach of the AUP.Apple Terms on the App StoreThe following Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including, but not limited to, the iPhone and iPad applications available via the Apple, Inc.

This Privacy Policy is intended to provide as much relevant information as possible; however, if you need more specific information, please contact us at\u00a0privacy@dialpad.com.Disclosure With Your ConsentWhere we are processing your information as a processor on behalf of a Customer, the Customer determines their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of your information and Dialpad does not control how a Customer or any other third parties choose to share or disclose information.

As such, many of the specific provisions of the GDPR are covered in the main privacy policy.Dialpad warrants that it complies and that it is able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.Under the GDPR and when processing your data, Dialpad will act as either a processor (or sub-processor, as applicable) or a controller, depending on the purpose for the data processing. While processing Personal Data for the provision of Dialpad\u2019s Services, Dialpad\u2019s Customer is the Controller (or a Processor processing Personal Data on behalf of a third-party Controller), and Dialpad is a Processor (or sub-Processor, as applicable). In this case, the end-user of the service is the data subject.While processing Personal Data for the improvement of the Service via Dialpad Ai Training (as discussed in the main Privacy Policy) Dialpad acts as a Controller.As Processor, Dialpad will comply with the instructions contained in this document, in the Dialpad Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy, Dialpad\u2019s Data Processing Agreement (DPA), in any agreements between you and Dialpad, or other instructions that you provide later.As Controller, Dialpad will use, with your consent, your Personal Data for improving our services by, for example, saving and analyzing segments of call audio, video, or transcriptions, both to enable these features and to train and improve the models that these features are based on, as described in the\u00a0Dialpad Ai page.

You may opt out of manual review at any time by contacting legal@dialpad.com. You can control what data is stored by choosing which Dialpad features you use from the settings menu in the relevant Service.Dialpad ensures that the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to the United States is authorized via a suitable legal vehicle, such as the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses.
