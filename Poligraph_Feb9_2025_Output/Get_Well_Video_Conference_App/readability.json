Through partnerships with some of the most progressive hospitals and health systems in the world, Get Well uses digital technology to improve the healthcare experience for patients, their families, and clinicians. Get Well is leading the movement towards a more collaborative and participatory patient and family experience. As a patient receiving care in a hospital, individuals are not always able to visit with the people they love and care about. The care process is enriched by the participation of a patient\u2019s loved ones. Being able to see them and talk to them while the patient is treated or is recovering in the hospital provides incalculable benefits to a patient\u2019s well-being. In the spirit of one of Get Well\u2019s core tenets of leading patients toward a more participatory and family experience, Get Well\u2019s Zoom video conferencing capability connects the patient to friends and family through Zoom solutions deployed directly into the hospital room by clicking and entering a phone number or email address. Patients can now add family members and friends into the care process by including them in important conversations with their care team. Patients in isolation as well as younger patients with siblings that are not able to visit the hospital can now communicate with their loved ones face to face through Zoom and Get Well\u2019s shared technology. Bringing together the powerful tools Zoom and Get Well offer, patients are given effective mechanisms to enrich their hospital stay experience; family and friends are provided channels into supporting their loved one during a trying time, and hospital staff are given additional tools to enhance the healing care their patients need.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Application Type</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This integration app is an Account_Level app, a zoom admin account will authorize this app and this authorization will let the app create a meeting on behalf of the Zoom Room, and Zoom Room can also perform join call and end call operations using Zoom OAuth protected apis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential user of this app is the patient in a hospital room using Get Well\u2019s Inpatient application on a TV equipped with a Zoom Room hardware. Get Well\u2019s InPatient app will perform zoom api operations on behalf of the patient via a connected Zoom Room.
