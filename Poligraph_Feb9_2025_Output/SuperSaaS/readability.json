2022</strong></p>\n<h2>Information we collect and how we use it</h2>\n<p>\n\tWe offer a variety of services, some of which require your users\u2019 registration or personal information.\n\tThis document will refer to your users as \u201cend users\u201d.\n\tIn order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Information you provide</strong> \u2013\n\t\tWhen you sign up for a SuperSaaS account we ask you for\tpersonal information (such as your name, email address and an account password).\n\t\tWe may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other SuperSaaS services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.\n\t\tFor certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.\n\t\tFor our premium accounts, we use a payment provider who will store your payment account information on their secure servers.\n\t\tThis information is not shared or combined with others.\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>SuperSaaS cookies</strong> \u2013\n\t\tWhen you visit SuperSaaS, we send one or more cookies \u2013 a small file containing a string of characters \u2013 to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.\n\t\tWe use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking visitor trends.\n\t\tMost browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\n\t\tYou can control and/or delete cookies as you wish.\n\t\tHowever, some essential SuperSaaS features and services cannot function if your cookies are disabled.\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Log information</strong> \u2013\n\t\tWhen you use SuperSaaS services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you use a web application.\n\t\tThese server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>User communications</strong> \u2013\n\t\tWhen you send email or other communication to SuperSaaS, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SuperSaaS processes personal information for the purposes described above, and in addition to the above we use the information to:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>provide our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising</li>\n\t<li>audit, research and analyze in order to maintain, protect and improve our services</li>\n\t<li>ensure the technical functioning of our network</li>\n\t<li>develop new services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\tSuperSaaS processes personal information and appointment and booking data on our servers in the Netherlands and in other countries.\n\tIn some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country, but we do not process information on servers outside the European Union.\n\tWe may process your personal information to provide our own services.\n\tIn some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.\n\tWe will not use personal information of your end users that may be stored in our system to provide our own services.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Right to be forgotten</h3>\n<p>\n\tIf you want to completely remove your account and all associated data from our servers, you can <a href=\"https://www.supersaas.com/accounts/cancel\">erase all your data</a> with a single click.\n\tThis also erases any data of users who may have created an appointment via your account.\n\tIf you are on a paid plan this link will also cancel your subscription.\n\tHowever, please know that you are welcome to keep your account around as a free account, in case you possibly want to use it again in the future.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Options regarding your personal information</h3>\n<p>\n\tWhen you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information.\n\tIf we intend to use this information in a manner other than the purpose for which it was collected, we will ask for your consent prior to such use.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes.\n\tWe will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYou can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case SuperSaaS may not be able to provide those services to you.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Third-Party advertisements on the free version</h2>\n\n<p>\n\tOur free service shows advertisements to you and your end users.\n\tOn some pages of the free service, Google AdSense uses cookies to serve these ads.\n\tGoogle\u2019s use of the cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to our site sites and/or other sites on the Internet.\n\tYou may opt out of the use of these cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting <a href=\"https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous?hl=en\">Ads Settings</a>.\n\tFor more information see \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/\">How Google uses your data</a>\u201d.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Integration into another site</h2>\n<p>\n\tThis Privacy Policy applies to SuperSaaS services only.\n\tWe do not exercise control over the sites who provide SuperSaaS services as part of their own offering.\n\tThese other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.\n\tWe cannot be held responsible for any wrongful handling of end users\u2019 information by our customers.\n</p>\n\n<h3>European Union user consent policy and the GDPR</h3>\n<p>\n\tWhen using SuperSaaS embedded into another site, certain disclosures must be given to and consents obtained from end users in the European Union where the law requires such disclosures and consents.\n\tFor end users in the European Union you must use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that an end user is provided with clear and comprehensive information about this site\u2019s policies.\n\tIf you have end users in the European Union you will need to ensure that your use of the system complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as explained on our page\n\t<a href=\"https://www.supersaas.com/info/gdpr\">about the GDPR</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Information sharing</h2>\n<p>SuperSaaS only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside SuperSaaS in the following limited circumstances: </p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>\n\t<li>We may provide such information to affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf.\n\t\tWe require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to\n\t\t(a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,\n\t\t(b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof,\n\t\t(c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or\n\t\t(d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of SuperSaaS, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If SuperSaaS becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and\n\tbecomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>\n<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>\n\n<h2>Information security</h2>\n<p>\n\tWe take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.\n\tWe restrict access to personal information to SuperSaaS employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.\n\tThese individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Data integrity</h2>\n<p>\n\tSuperSaaS processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice.\n\tWe review our data collection, storage and processing practices ensuring that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services.\n\tWe take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Accessing and updating personal information</h2>\n<p>\n\tWhen you use SuperSaaS services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.\n\tWe ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.\n\tIn any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>\n<p>\n\tPlease note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.\n\tWe will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.\n\tRegardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes).\n\tEach version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.\n</p>\n\t<h2>Contact Information</h2>\n\t<p>\n\t\tFor questions regarding this policy, or the information we store about you, you can contact us via our <a
