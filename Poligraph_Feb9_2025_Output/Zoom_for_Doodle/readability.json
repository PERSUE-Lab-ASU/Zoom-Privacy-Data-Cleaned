In some cases, Doodle displays advertisements from Google\u2019s AdSense or AdExchange network. These advertisements can be targeted based on the poll content. Google does not disclose that information and only uses it for the intended purpose.

Furthermore, outdated polls are automatically deleted from time to time, but no earlier than 30 days after the last date in the poll, or 30 days after the last access to a poll without dates. Polls created with premium accounts will not be deleted automatically as long as the subscription remains active. Should the subscription expire, the deletion rules mentioned above apply to all polls associated to the account after 30 days of expiry. 8. Inactive accounts Doodle can delete user accounts if they remain inactive (i.e. not accessed) for 1 year or longer. Doodle implements several mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to polls, accounts, or other data.To access a poll, you use the unique link which Doodle provides and which contains a random access code. This link is an important element to prevent unauthorized access to a poll. You should send this link only to authorized people, i.e., the people you wish to participate in your poll. \n\nUser-accounts are protected by passwords. You should choose a secure password and ensure its confidentiality to prevent unauthorized access to your account. 10.
