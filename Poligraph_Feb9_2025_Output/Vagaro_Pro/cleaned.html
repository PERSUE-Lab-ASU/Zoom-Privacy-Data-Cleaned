<li class="mb-1 text-base leading-8 text-inkDarker">Device Information. Information about Your Customer's device, including hardware model, operating system and version, device name, unique device identifier, mobile network information, and information about the device's interaction with our Services;</li>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-normal text-inkDark">Information Consumers May Provide Vagaro</h3>
<ul class="my-6 list-outside list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-base font-normal leading-7 text-gray-900">
<li class="mb-1 text-base leading-8 text-inkDarker">Identification information. Your customer’s/Consumer’s name, email address, or telephone number, which we link to a tokenized version of their payment card number. Privacy laws that apply in certain places, like California, treat “businesses” and “service providers” differently. Under those laws, a business is the company that decides why and how to process personal information. A service provider processes personal information on behalf of a business in order to provide services. When Vagaro processes Your Customer’s Data, we generally act as your service provider. In select cases, however, we may act as a business when we process Your Customer’s Data. For example, we act as a business when we use Your Customer’s Data to send Your Customer’s digital receipts directly from Vagaro, or when we allow you to use Customer Directory or Vagaro Marketing to contact your buyer using a masked email address that gets routed to them via Vagaro.</li>
