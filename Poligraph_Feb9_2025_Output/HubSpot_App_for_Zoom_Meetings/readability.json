HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA</span></p>\n<p>2.1 To Communicate with You About the Product and Services.

We also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer support.</p>\n<p>2.3 To Improve and Develop Our Product and Services. We use professional data, log files, and usage data about how you or your users interact with our product and services to develop and improve our products and services. For example, we use usage data to assess trends and usage across the product to help us determine what new features or integrations our users may be interested in.</p>\n<p>We may use Customer Data to support and develop AI features and functionality within the Subscription Service and similar products and services that rely on machine learning. You may opt out of having your Customer Data used to train HubSpot models by emailing <a href=\"mailto:privacy@hubspot.com\" rel=\"noopener\">privacy@hubspot.com</a>.</p>\n<p>We may publish data about how our product and services are being used across our customer base. When we share statistical information externally in this way, the data will be aggregated and we will not identify individual users or customers. For example, we may publish blog posts on trends or insights into how users are interacting with our product.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2.4 To Secure and Protect our Product and HubSpot Users. We use your account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents. We may also use this information to meet legal requirements. We use your information to verify user accounts, new product sign-ups, and to detect and prevent product abuse. This includes enforcing our <a href=\"https://legal.hubspot.com/acceptable-use\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of the websites by you, including how you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control and regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also collected and logged for security and debugging purposes, for example to track access patterns, investigate security events and incidents. For these purposes we associate automatically-collected data to other personal data provided by you such as name, email address, address, and phone number.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.5 To Market and Promote the Subscription Service. We use Personal Data to advertise, market, and promote our products, services, and other offerings.

If you unsubscribe from our marketing lists, we will continue to contact you regarding administrative matters, and to respond to your requests.</p>\n<p>We may reach out to you via telephone to ask about other HubSpot products or services you may be interested in. If you have a call scheduled with a HubSpot representative, we may record and transcribe the call. You will be notified prior to the call that the call is being recorded, and you will be offered an opportunity to opt-out of having the call recorded. &nbsp;We may also reach out to you via SMS, and you will be offered an opportunity to opt out of those communications. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Where required by law, we will only send marketing communications with your consent. Otherwise, we will market and advertise our products and services on the basis of our legitimate business interests.</p>\n<p>We may use information collected from third party service providers and other sources in combination with other information we collect through other means described in this Privacy Policy for the purposes of providing you with updates and improved services, personalized communications, event promotion, and to otherwise improve the user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.6 Other Purposes if We Obtain Your Consent.

HubSpot's Data Protection Officer can be contacted <a href=\"https://preferences.hubspot.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.</p>\n<p>If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>\n\n<p>3<span>. HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL DATA</span></p>\n<p><span>3.1 Service Providers.</span>&nbsp;<span>We may share Personal Data with our third party service providers to support our websites, products, and services.

Examples may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data or performing statistical analysis on your use of the Subscription Service or interactions on our websites, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, developing and improving the product and services, and providing customer service or support. These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the third party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies and standards.</span></p>\n<p>3.2 Partners. We may share your personal data with trusted HubSpot partners to: (i) contact you based on your communication preferences; (ii) help us perform statistical analysis; (iii) provide sales support; (iv) provide customer support; and (v) to improve our partner programs and Subscriptions Services. Partners are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your data.</p>\n<p>We also partner with trusted third parties to provide you with co-marketing content that we think may be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners, we will tell you who we are sharing data with, and provide a link to the co-marketing partner\u2019s privacy policy so you can learn more about their privacy practices and how to opt-out of the partner\u2019s communications. You will always have a choice as to whether to disclose your Personal Information to our co-marketing partners. These co-marketing partners are required to adhere to our privacy and data protection policies. For more information on our co-marketing program, see <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/co-marketing-request-form?_gl=1*1tnn7k5*_ga*MTYyMTg2ODcxMi4xNzE1MTkxODIz*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTcxNTM2OTg0MS45LjEuMTcxNTM3MTUxNi42MC4wLjA.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a>.</p>\n<p>3.3 Advertising Partners. We allow advertising networks to collect information about your interactions with our websites in order to deliver Hubspot\u2019s personalized ads. We may also share Personal Data, such as your email address, with our advertising partners to deliver Hubspot\u2019s personalized ads on other companies' sites or mobile apps. &nbsp;You can opt out of having your data disclosed to our advertising partners through this <a href=\"http://hubspot.com/hubspot-privacy-preferences\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">form</a>.</p>\n<p>3.4 Corporate Events. If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by HubSpot on the websites and the Subscription Service. In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>3.5 Public Forums. Our websites may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums (e.g., HubSpot Community, Connect.com, etc.). Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public message boards, blogs, or forums (including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information) it may be read, collected and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you may disclose in this way. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the websites if you so request, as described in the\"Your Privacy Rights and Choices\" section of this Privacy Notice. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information; we will let you know if we are unable to and why, if permitted.</p>\n<p>3.6 Compelled Disclosure. We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process. If you use the Subscription Service, Customer Data is considered Confidential Information and you should review the Confidentiality terms in the <a href=\"https://legal.hubspot.com/terms-of-service\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Customer Terms of Service</a> for more information.

We may share your Personal Data with our current and future parents, Affiliates, subsidiaries, and other entities under common control and ownership to the extent necessary to fulfill your request or for other purposes permitted under this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>3.8 HubSpot Customers in Connection with Our Enrichment Products. We may share Personal Data about individuals in our commercial dataset with our customers that use our enrichment products. Customers may use this information for their sales and marketing activities. We rely on our legitimate interests, as well as those of our customers, to collect and share data for the purposes listed. HubSpot\u2019s and our customers\u2019 legitimate interests are not more important than your privacy rights, and we process your data on the basis that people would expect their work-related data to be shared in this way. See the \u201cInformation We Collect and Process In Connection With Our Enrichment Products\u201d section for more information.&nbsp;</p>\n<a id=\"How-We-Transfer-Data-We-Collect-Internationally\" data-hs-anchor=\"true\"></a>\n<p>4<span>.

When we share Personal Data of individuals in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (\"UK\") within and among HubSpot\u2019s Affiliates, we rely upon the the Standard Contractual Clauses (approved by the European Commission and Swiss authorities) and UK Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (approved by the UK authorities) where required. &nbsp;We also have additional safeguards where appropriate (such as commercial industry standard secure encryption methods to protect customer data at rest and in transit, TLS for HubSpot hosted sites, web application firewall protection, and other appropriate contractual and organizational measures), as described more in detail in the <a href=\"https://trust.hubspot.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HubSpot Trust Center</a>.</p>\n<p>4.2 International Transfers to Third Parties. Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA, Switzerland or UK with third parties, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer including the European Commission-approved Data Privacy Framework Standard Contractual Clauses, as well as additional safeguards where appropriate. For transfers to or from the United Kingdom, we make use of the UK Addendum. For transfers to or from Canada, we make use of the standard contractual clauses. With respect to personal data received from or transferred to Canada, HubSpot is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
