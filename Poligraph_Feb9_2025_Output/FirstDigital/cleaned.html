<p>For account security, verification or tax purposes, FirstDigital may also request federal tax ID information, purchase order number, and information about the individual(s) responsible for business account administration. &nbsp;Additionally, in the course of providing&nbsp;telephony services, FirstDigital obtains information such as class or type of service, technical characteristics, billing records, location of service and other information. &nbsp;This type of information also is considered CPNI.&nbsp; The FCC has deemed your name (individual or business), address and telephone number, (which, is regarded as “subscriber list information”) and not subject to CPNI&nbsp;regulation.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We use personally identifiable information to process customer orders as well as provide and bill for services.&nbsp; We also use personally identifiable information that has been provided to us by a website visitor to carry out the purpose or respond to the request for which is was given, such as a request for information about our services.&nbsp; In addition, we may contact our customers and visitors to inform them about our products and services, as well as communications-related services offered by third parties with whom we have a relationship.&nbsp; You may opt out of such&nbsp;marketing communications at any time by contacting us @ <strong>CustomerServiceGroup@firstdigital.com</strong>&nbsp;.</p>

<p><strong>ABUSE OF ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We have the right to share your name and contact information with our attorneys and law enforcement officials, if needed, in the event we believe you have breached our Acceptable Use Policy or otherwise harmed us or any of our customers in&nbsp;any&nbsp;way.</p>
<p><strong>LAW ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>
<p>Legal Requirements – There are times when, in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations, court or administrative orders, subpoenas or other matters, FirstDigital must disclose information, including Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and CPNI.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a provider of Internet communications services, we regularly receive legal requests for customer information from government and law enforcement personnel.&nbsp; We fully cooperate with state, local, and federal officials in any investigation&nbsp;relating to any content, including personal or private electronic communications transmitted to FirstDigital or purported unlawful activities of any user of any FirstDigital Site or service, and take reasonable measures to protect our proprietary rights. We also receive discovery requests in civil litigation. In all such cases, our policy is to cooperate as required by law, but to provide only such information as the law requires. This information is generally sought by subpoena served on FirstDigital. Under current law, many criminal subpoenas require that we not disclose or notify you of the request. Due to this fact and the volume of requests we receive, we cannot assume any duty to notify you of receipt of any&nbsp;legal&nbsp;requests.</p>
<p>Internet Information – Current law provides that personal accounts and other information concerning use of our internet services may be subpoenaed by governmental entities. In such cases, you may not be entitled to notice of such a request. The content of internet communications may not generally be sought through use of a subpoena. The law does permit us to disclose to law enforcement, voluntarily and without prior notice, customer information, including the contents of communications, if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury requires such disclosure&nbsp;without&nbsp;delay</p>
<p>Telephone Information – In some areas, FirstDigital provides telephone services to its customers. Current law requires law enforcement to obtain a court order or warrant for a telephone wiretap or to use a pen register or trap and trace device to capture dialing&nbsp;information. FirstDigital reserves the right to, and&nbsp;will, share information when it believes, in its sole discretion, it is necessary to prevent unlawful use of communications services, when necessary to repair or restore network outages, in emergency situations (e.g. 911 calls; matters of public safety, etc.) or to protect the security or integrity of&nbsp;FirstDigital.</p>
<p>FirstDigital may monitor and/or disclose communications of any kind over its networks (i) to satisfy any law,&nbsp;regulation, or government request (e.g. response to private or law enforcement-issued subpoena); (ii) if such monitoring and/or disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate We &nbsp;(e.g. recording of Customer Care calls); or (iii) to protect the rights or property of FirstDigital or others (e.g. to prevent fraud, infringement of rights, etc.). &nbsp;Additionally, in connection with the potential sale or transfer of any of its interest in FirstDigital, FirstDigital&nbsp;reserves the right to sell or transfer visitor or Customer information to a third party that (i) concentrates its business in communication products or services, (ii) agrees to be FirstDigital’s successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of information collected and maintained by FirstDigital, and&nbsp;(iii) agrees to the material obligations of this Privacy Notice. &nbsp;Furthermore, we may or may not recognize the do-no-track headers from some or all&nbsp;browsers.</p>

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the website uses to track the pages you have visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. The information stored by one website into a cookie cannot be read by&nbsp;another&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>We use cookies to provide you a richer, personalized experience on our Site, to customize your shopping experience, and to remember who you are when you revisit our Site. Additionally, if you have chosen to Opt-Out of certain communications, you must accept cookies. We do not store any personal information about you in the cookie. We also use this ID to track the pages you visit on&nbsp;our&nbsp;Site.</p>
<p>Due to their core role of enhancing and enabling usability or site processes, disabling certain cookies may prevent you from using certain aspects of our&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two different types of browser&nbsp;cookie:</p>
<p><strong><em>Session cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>These types of cookies are stored in the computer’s memory during a user’s browsing session and are automatically deleted when the browser is closed, or the session is deemed to have ended.&nbsp; Session cookies usually store a session ID that is not personally identifiable to users, allowing the user to move from page to page without having to log-in repeatedly.&nbsp; They are widely used by commercial websites; for example, to keep track of items that a user has added to a shopping&nbsp;basket.</p>
<p><strong><em>Persistent cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>Persistent cookies are stored on a user’s computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed.&nbsp; They can be used to retain user preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions.&nbsp; A unique ID is usually assign to the user’s browser and typically configured to identify a user for a prolonged period of&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The following classification of cookies used on our website is based on the International Chamber of Commerce guide for cookie&nbsp;categories:</p>
<p><strong><em>Strictly necessary cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>‘Strictly necessary’ cookies let you move around the website and use essential features such as ensuring connectivity to the right service or when we make any change to the way our website works. &nbsp;No information about you is retained for future use or remembering where you’ve been on the internet. &nbsp;Accepting these cookies is a condition of using this website as they are required for the proper operation of our website. &nbsp;If you prevent them, we cannot guarantee how our website will perform during your&nbsp;visit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Performance cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>We use performance cookies to collect information about how visitors use our website, which parts of the website you like and what types of content you view. &nbsp;By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. &nbsp;We use the information to improve our website and enhance our user experience. &nbsp;All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore&nbsp;anonymous.</p>
<p><strong><em>Functionality cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>Functionality cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience. By using the website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your&nbsp;device.</p>
<p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as content preferences, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. &nbsp;These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. &nbsp;They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as commenting on a blog. &nbsp;The information these cookies collect may be anonymized but cannot track your browsing activity on other&nbsp;websites.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>FirstDigital uses encryption, firewalls, and other technology and security procedures to help protect the accuracy and security of your personal information and prevent unauthorized access or improper&nbsp;use.&nbsp; We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.&nbsp; FirstDigital employees are bound by non-disclosure agreements designed to prevent them from disclosing any PII or CPNI.&nbsp; Further, FirstDigital employees must abide by all state and federal laws and regulations in the performance of their job duties.&nbsp; Our policies also limit access to PII to only those employees, contractors, agents or representatives that require the information to perform their jobs or assist FirstDigital with providing products and services to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>When FirstDigital collects credit card information, it is used solely to bill Customers for the products and services they receive.&nbsp; FirstDigital does not share&nbsp;credit card information except as may be necessary to process Customer transactions.&nbsp; FirstDigital employs customary web-based security and encryption protocols, such as user identity verification/login policies Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET), to secure transmission of that information.&nbsp; If your browser does not support use of&nbsp;such secure connections, or if you prefer not to send your credit card number over the Internet, please contact <a href="http://www.xo.com/support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Customer Care</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>However, as effective as modern security practices are, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. FirstDigital cannot guarantee the security of its systems or databases, nor can FirstDigital guarantee that information supplied by you will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the&nbsp;Internet.&nbsp; FirstDigital is not responsible for the unlawful or unauthorized actions of third&nbsp;parties.</p>
<p><strong>Directory Information and Caller ID</strong></p>
<p>Subscriber information is made available for telephone directories and to display Caller ID information where&nbsp;available.&nbsp; Customers subscribing to FirstDigital local telephone service are given the opportunity to request that their name, number and address be or not be published in directories, be made available through directory assistance or appear in “Yellow Pages” or other similar business directories.&nbsp; Such requests may require&nbsp;payment of additional fees. &nbsp;Please contact your local FirstDigital service representative for more information. &nbsp;A Customer’s name and number may, where available, be transmitted and displayed on a Caller ID device unless the Customer, subject to compliance with Caller ID rules, has elected to block such information. &nbsp;Please note that Caller ID blocking does not prevent the display of a caller’s number when dialing certain business numbers, 911, 900&nbsp;numbers, or toll-free 800, 888, or 877&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO PRIVACY STATEMEN</strong><strong>T</strong></p>
<p>We may occasionally change our Privacy Statement. If we do, we will post the new Privacy Statement on the Site. The changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately&nbsp;upon&nbsp;posting.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>FirstDigital has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (‘COPPA’) and other applicable laws relating to the use of children’s data. This policy is intended to supplement our general&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;Statement.</p>
<p>Although our Site is not specifically directed toward children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 13 on our Site, we recognize that parents and children visit the Site. This provides us with the opportunity to help educate consumers about the Federal Trade Commission’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;visit&nbsp;<strong>www.ftc.gov/kidsprivacy</strong>&nbsp;for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children’s privacy&nbsp;online. Parents should consider using one of a number of available parental control tools that provide a child-friendly, on-line environment and can prevent children from disclosing PII without parental consent.&nbsp; If a child has provided personal information without the consent of a parent or guardian, that parent or guardian should contact us to request that the information be deleted from our&nbsp;records.</p>
<p>Prospective users between the ages of 13 and 17 can only use the Site under their parents’ or legal guardian’s supervision. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you, your parent, or your legal guardian may request that we delete any of your personal information in our database and/or opt-out from receiving communications&nbsp;from&nbsp;us.</p>
<p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION OF CHILDREN’S PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>A user is never required to disclose any personal information to visit the Site. Personal information is never collected from users who do not sign up for the Site or one of our services. Until registration has been completed, our system does not actually store any&nbsp;personal&nbsp;information</p>
<p>FirstDigital does not substantively monitor our public areas except to determine compliance with our Appropriate Use Policy and Privacy Statement. We do not require any user to disclose personal information to use the public areas of the Site. If we obtain actual knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has disclosed personal information in a public area of our Site, we will delete any personally identifying information from the public area and from&nbsp;our&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>FirstDigital cannot prevent a child under the age of 13 from sending emails. However, if FirstDigital obtains actual knowledge that an email comes from a child under the age of 13, our customer service staff is trained to initiate our internal COPPA compliance process, which includes the deletion from our system of all personal information about the child, including the&nbsp;email&nbsp;address.</p>
<p>FirstDigital may occasionally run contests or sweepstakes. Like our general registration, sweepstakes and contests are not open to children under the age of 13. Any registration for a contest or sweepstakes likewise requests the age of the entrant. If we learn that the entrant is less than 13, the entry will be deleted. Whenever the Site requests personal information from a visitor before the visitor can participate in an activity, the visitor is not required to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in&nbsp;the&nbsp;activity.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>If FirstDigital changes its policy with respect to the collection of personal information about children under the age of 13, the changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately&nbsp;upon&nbsp;posting.</p>
