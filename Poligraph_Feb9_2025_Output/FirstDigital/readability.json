This information is generally sought by subpoena served on FirstDigital. Under current law, many criminal subpoenas require that we not disclose or notify you of the request.

The changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately&nbsp;upon&nbsp;posting.</p>\n<p><strong>CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>\n<p>FirstDigital has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u2018COPPA\u2019) and other applicable laws relating to the use of children\u2019s data. This policy is intended to supplement our general&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;Statement.</p>\n<p>Although our Site is not specifically directed toward children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 13 on our Site, we recognize that parents and children visit the Site. This provides us with the opportunity to help educate consumers about the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;visit&nbsp;<strong>www.ftc.gov/kidsprivacy</strong>&nbsp;for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children\u2019s privacy&nbsp;online. Parents should consider using one of a number of available parental control tools that provide a child-friendly, on-line environment and can prevent children from disclosing PII without parental consent.&nbsp; If a child has provided personal information without the consent of a parent or guardian, that parent or guardian should contact us to request that the information be deleted from our&nbsp;records.</p>\n<p>Prospective users between the ages of 13 and 17 can only use the Site under their parents\u2019 or legal guardian\u2019s supervision.

Personal information is never collected from users who do not sign up for the Site or one of our services. Until registration has been completed, our system does not actually store any&nbsp;personal&nbsp;information</p>\n<p>FirstDigital does not substantively monitor our public areas except to determine compliance with our Appropriate Use Policy and Privacy Statement. We do not require any user to disclose personal information to use the public areas of the Site. If we obtain actual knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has disclosed personal information in a public area of our Site, we will delete any personally identifying information from the public area and from&nbsp;our&nbsp;system.</p>\n<p>FirstDigital cannot prevent a child under the age of 13 from sending emails. However, if FirstDigital obtains actual knowledge that an email comes from a child under the age of 13, our customer service staff is trained to initiate our internal COPPA compliance process, which includes the deletion from our system of all personal information about the child, including the&nbsp;email&nbsp;address.</p>\n<p>FirstDigital may occasionally run contests or sweepstakes. Like our general registration, sweepstakes and contests are not open to children under the age of 13. Any registration for a contest or sweepstakes likewise requests the age of the entrant. If we learn that the entrant is less than 13, the entry will be deleted. Whenever the Site requests personal information from a visitor before the visitor can participate in an activity, the visitor is not required to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in&nbsp;the&nbsp;activity.</p>\n<p><strong>CHANGES TO CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>\n<p>If FirstDigital changes its policy with respect to the collection of personal information about children under the age of 13, the changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately&nbsp;upon&nbsp;posting.</p>\n</div></div>", "textContent": "\nPRIVACY STATEMENT\nFirstDigital Telecom, LLC, (FirstDigital\u201d), created this privacy policy outlining your privacy rights to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.\u00a0 The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the websites operated by FirstDigital (the \u201cSite\u201d), its operating companies, and affiliates, and is found at www.firstdigital.com\u00a0\u00a0 This policy applies to all of FirstDigital\u2019s operating companies and affiliates (herein collectively referred to as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cCompany,\u201d or \u201cFirstDigital) and herein referred to as \u201cCustomer,\u201d \u201cYou.\u201d \u00a0We respect the privacy of every individual and have published this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect and use information from FirstDigital Customers as well as visitors to our websites\u00a0(\u201cVisitors\u201d).\nFirstDigital is the sole owner of the information collected on the Site.

FirstDigital will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties other than its suppliers, affiliates, or business partners except with your\u00a0express\u00a0permission.\nFirstDigital will take reasonable steps to collect the minimum amount of personal information necessary to accomplish the specific purpose and will provide reasonable access to individuals regarding the personal information we hold about them.\u00a0 FirstDigital\u2019s standard practice is to delete information when there is no longer a legitimate\u00a0business purpose for retaining\u00a0it.\nHOW WE USE EMAIL\nOccasionally, we send out email updates on products, services, sales, special events, and promotions. Customers whom we think might be interested in learning about this information will receive\u00a0these\u00a0emails.\nWe also use email as a means of communicating with our customers. We love to hear from you, and we encourage you to email us with your questions\u00a0or\u00a0comments\nFirstDigital provides customers with a means of declining email offers. Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices.

We also receive discovery requests in civil litigation. In all such cases, our policy is to cooperate as required by law, but to provide only such information as the law requires. This information is generally sought by subpoena served on FirstDigital. Under current law, many criminal subpoenas require that we not disclose or notify you of the request. Due to this fact and the volume of requests we receive, we cannot assume any duty to notify you of receipt of any\u00a0legal\u00a0requests.\nInternet Information \u2013 Current law provides that personal accounts and other information concerning use of our internet services may be subpoenaed by governmental entities. In such cases, you may not be entitled to notice of such a request. The content of internet communications may not generally be sought through use of a subpoena. The law does permit us to disclose to law enforcement, voluntarily and without prior notice, customer information, including the contents of communications, if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury requires such disclosure\u00a0without\u00a0delay\nTelephone Information \u2013 In some areas, FirstDigital provides telephone services to its customers. Current law requires law enforcement to obtain a court order or warrant for a telephone wiretap or to use a pen register or trap and trace device to capture dialing\u00a0information. FirstDigital reserves the right to, and\u00a0will, share information when it believes, in its sole discretion, it is necessary to prevent unlawful use of communications services, when necessary to repair or restore network outages, in emergency situations (e.g. 911 calls; matters of public safety, etc.) or to protect the security or integrity of\u00a0FirstDigital.\nFirstDigital may monitor and/or disclose communications of any kind over its networks (i) to satisfy any law,\u00a0regulation, or government request (e.g. response to private or law enforcement-issued subpoena); (ii) if such monitoring and/or disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate We \u00a0(e.g. recording of Customer Care calls); or (iii) to protect the rights or property of FirstDigital or others (e.g. to prevent fraud, infringement of rights, etc.). \u00a0Additionally, in connection with the potential sale or transfer of any of its interest in FirstDigital, FirstDigital\u00a0reserves the right to sell or transfer visitor or Customer information to a third party that (i) concentrates its business in communication products or services, (ii) agrees to be FirstDigital\u2019s successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of information collected and maintained by FirstDigital, and\u00a0(iii) agrees to the material obligations of this Privacy Notice. \u00a0Furthermore, we may or may not recognize the do-no-track headers from some or all\u00a0browsers.\nLINKED SITES\nOur Site may contain links to other websites that are owned and operated by third parties.

If we do, we will post the new Privacy Statement on the Site. The changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately\u00a0upon\u00a0posting.\nCHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY STATEMENT\nFirstDigital has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u2018COPPA\u2019) and other applicable laws relating to the use of children\u2019s data. This policy is intended to supplement our general\u00a0Privacy\u00a0Statement.\nAlthough our Site is not specifically directed toward children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 13 on our Site, we recognize that parents and children visit the Site. This provides us with the opportunity to help educate consumers about the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule.\u00a0Please\u00a0visit\u00a0www.ftc.gov/kidsprivacy\u00a0for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children\u2019s privacy\u00a0online. Parents should consider using one of a number of available parental control tools that provide a child-friendly, on-line environment and can prevent children from disclosing PII without parental consent.\u00a0 If a child has provided personal information without the consent of a parent or guardian, that parent or guardian should contact us to request that the information be deleted from our\u00a0records.\nProspective users between the ages of 13 and 17 can only use the Site under their parents\u2019 or legal guardian\u2019s supervision. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you, your parent, or your legal guardian may request that we delete any of your personal information in our database and/or opt-out from receiving communications\u00a0from\u00a0us.\nIMPLEMENTATION OF CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY STATEMENT\nA user is never required to disclose any personal information to visit the Site. Personal information is never collected from users who do not sign up for the Site or one of our services. Until registration has been completed, our system does not actually store any\u00a0personal\u00a0information\nFirstDigital does not substantively monitor our public areas except to determine compliance with our Appropriate Use Policy and Privacy Statement. We do not require any user to disclose personal information to use the public areas of the Site. If we obtain actual knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has disclosed personal information in a public area of our Site, we will delete any personally identifying information from the public area and from\u00a0our\u00a0system.\nFirstDigital cannot prevent a child under the age of 13 from sending emails. However, if FirstDigital obtains actual knowledge that an email comes from a child under the age of 13, our customer service staff is trained to initiate our internal COPPA compliance process, which includes the deletion from our system of all personal information about the child, including the\u00a0email\u00a0address.\nFirstDigital may occasionally run contests or sweepstakes. Like our general registration, sweepstakes and contests are not open to children under the age of 13. Any registration for a contest or sweepstakes likewise requests the age of the entrant. If we learn that the entrant is less than 13, the entry will be deleted. Whenever the Site requests personal information from a visitor before the visitor can participate in an activity, the visitor is not required to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in\u00a0the\u00a0activity.\nCHANGES TO CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY STATEMENT\nIf FirstDigital changes its policy with respect to the collection of personal information about children under the age of 13, the changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately\u00a0upon\u00a0posting.\n", "length": 26983, "excerpt": "The FirstDigial blog is full of great information to improve your business.
