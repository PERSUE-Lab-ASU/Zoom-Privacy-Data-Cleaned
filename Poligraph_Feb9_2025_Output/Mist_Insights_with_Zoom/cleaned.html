            <p><b>What We Do</b></p>
<p>We, Juniper Networks, Inc., 1133 Innovation Way, Sunnyvale, California 94089 USA, and other companies in Juniper Networks, Inc.’s group worldwide, including Mist Systems, Inc. (collectively, “Juniper Networks”), provide network infrastructure products, services, and solutions for enterprise networks, for the cloud and for service providers (collectively, the “Juniper Products”). Our technology includes, for example, routers, switches, network management software and network security products, both wired and wireless. You can find examples of our products, solutions, and services on our <a href="https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products.html">website</a>.</p>
<p>We typically distribute Juniper Products through resellers and channel partners. When Juniper Products are used by our customers and channel partners on their own premises and in their own cloud account(s), we generally do not have access to the personal data processed by the Juniper Products unless we are providing installation services, customer support or success services, quality assurance, testing or other professional services.</p>
<p>When we do have access to personal data of individuals, it is typically as a service provider/supplier to our customers and channel partners, with limited exceptions, such as, for example:</p>
<ul><li>For our websites <a href="https://www.juniper.net/us/en.html">Juniper.net</a> and <a href="https://www.mist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mist.com</a>, related sub-sites and other websites and mobile applications (<i>e.g.</i>, Juniper Support Portal) that we provide (collectively “Our Websites”).</li><li>For our advertising, marketing, promotion, industry outreach and educational efforts (which are primarily in a business-to-business context versus direct-to-consumer).</li><li>In our relationships with our service providers.</li></ul>
<p>In our role as a service provider/supplier, our contracts generally restrict us from processing personal data of our customers and channel partners except for the purposes permitted under our contracts and under applicable law. We do not “sell” (as defined by certain privacy laws) personal data of individuals, except to the extent such term includes&nbsp;“sharing” (as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act) for the purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising or the use of your personal data for targeted advertising, as discussed <a href="https://www.juniper.net/us/en/privacy-policy/united-states-supplement.html">here</a>.<a id="our-commitment-to-privacy"></a></p>
<p><b>Our Commitment to Privacy</b></p>
<p>Juniper Networks respects and is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals. Together with the additional information at the links available above, this Privacy Notice (the “Notice”) describes our personal data processing, including in connection with the Juniper Products.

Information on the protection of privacy relating to job applicants is provided in our <a href="https://www.juniper.net/us/en/privacy-policy/recruiting-privacy-policy.html">Recruiting Privacy Notice</a>. Additional license terms, terms of use, contracts, agreements, and privacy statements may also apply to particular Juniper Products. If there are contradictions between this Notice and the more specific information for a particular Juniper Product, the more specific information shall prevail to the extent permitted under applicable law.<a id="information-we-may-collect"></a></p>
