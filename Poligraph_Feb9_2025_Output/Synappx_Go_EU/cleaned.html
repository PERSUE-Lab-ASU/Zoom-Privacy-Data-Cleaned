  <div class="text"><p>Sharp Electronics (Europe) Ltd. (“Sharp”) is committed to protecting Your privacy. Please read the following Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) carefully as it sets out Sharp’s policy for collecting, using, storing, processing and disclosing Your data and information obtained through the Services. When we refer to “we”, “our” or “us” in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to Sharp Electronics (Europe) and its subsidiaries and affiliates (together, “Sharp”) <a href="https://global.sharp/worldwide/">https://global.sharp/worldwide/</a> as the data controller or the equivalent legal construct under applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p>
Users can access the Services through a variety of means and devices, which include via the website, or through a desktop PC, laptop, mobile device, tablet, display system, multi-function peripheral device (“MFP”) or other electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs Your access and use of the Services regardless of how You access them and should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use for Synappx™ Go and Synappx™ Meeting (“Terms of Use”), as this Privacy Policy is incorporated therein by reference. All defined terms in the Terms of Use shall have the same meaning in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy only applies to Information provided through, stored in or accessed, processed and collected through the Services and may differ from other Sharp privacy policies. The term “Information” used in this Privacy Policy refers to all forms of data, information and content provided through, stored in or accessed, processed and collected through the Services and also may include Personal Data (defined below). The term “You” or “Your” used within this Privacy Policy shall refer to natural persons residing in the territorial scope of any European Union member state or a state within European Economic Area, including the Customer and its Administrator(s) or End Users (“Data Subjects”)</p>
<p>
Specific Software Services available through the Services may have additional terms or disclosures related to privacy or use of Information for that Specific Software Services (hereafter, “Specific Privacy Policies”); as it relates to the Specific Software Services, those additional Specific Privacy Policies shall apply in addition to those set out here. However, if there is any inconsistency between this Privacy Policy and the Specific Privacy Policies, the Specific Privacy Policies shall apply but only to the Specific Software Services.</p>
<p><strong>1. Information Collected</strong><br>
As part of Your use of and access to the Services and any Specific Software Services available through the Services, You may be asked to provide some types of personal information, personally identifiable information, or the equivalent of each under applicable privacy laws. This may include, but is not limited to, information to identify You or contact You, as well as some company information, such as address, post code, telephone number and e-mail address (“Personal Data”).</p>
<p>
Sharp may also collect and store additional information through Your use of and access to the Services, some of which may also be deemed Personal Data. This may include, but is not limited to, an IP address, MAC address (a unique identifier of the device), application selection and installation, browser type, language selection, access times, preferences and favorites, as well as storage use, usage patterns, Your general activity using the Services, pages viewed, links clicked and other actions taken in connection with the use of and access to the Services. This Information, including Personal Data may be used to provide or improve the Services, administer Your use of or access to the Services or to authenticate users accessing the Services, and in particular, an End User.<br>
Please note that credit card and financial information are not collected via the Services.</p>
<p>
As a responsible organization, we have implemented numerous technical and organisational measures to ensure the most complete protection of any Personal Data processed in the course of providing the Services, in order to meet the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).</p>
<p><strong>2. Use of Your Information</strong><br>
We limit the collection of Information to only that which is absolutely necessary to carry out our legal or business obligations.<br>
Sharp, Dealer and/or Third Party Service Providers may collect and may use the Information collected to operate and improve Services, deliver the Services and/or access, transmit, process and store the Information requested, and otherwise enhance the overall experience of the Services. This Information may also be used to respond to requests, communicate with You and assist You with questions or support. For instance, Sharp may, without limitation, use the Information to provide customer service and support, personalize the Services, update You on new products, services or marketing efforts, make offers, promotions or new content available to You based on geographic location, interests or preferences, or share information collected with existing or potential Third Party Service Providers to deliver or improve existing Services or help develop new Services.</p>
<p>
Sharp may further share Information with third parties: (1) who perform functions, as Sharp’s agent or contractor, including, but not limited to, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance hosting or providing some of the Services, as well as providing support or maintenance for the Services; (2) to comply with the law, applicable regulations, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce the Agreement or other agreements related to the Services, or to protect Sharp’s rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of Sharp’s users or others, including Dealers and Third Party Service Providers; (3) if the disclosure is done as part of a purchase, transfer or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of Sharp’s assets are acquired by another party, customer information may be one of the transferred assets); or (4) as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Sharp’s agents or contractors who have access to Information in connection with the above activities are required to keep the information confidential and not to use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Sharp. Other than above, Sharp will provide notice when Information about You may be shared with third parties and You will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>
<p>
Sharp may use Your Personal Data for the purposes outlined above because: (a) the data is required in order to provide you with the Services at Your request and consent, (b) the data is necessary for the performance and fulfilment of contract with You or (c) we are subject to legal or regulatory obligations, such as providing information to a public body or law enforcement agency.</p>

<p><strong>3. Cookies</strong><br>
The Services may use Cookies. A “Cookie” is a text-only string of characters which may be temporarily stored in Your browser. Sharp’s Cookies are time-sensitive. If the expiration of a Cookie is set to be longer than the time spent on a site, then this string may be saved in a Cookie on Your browser for future reference, otherwise it disappears from the browser when it times outs.

<p><strong>13. Data transfers</strong><br>
Where we process Personal Data originating in the EU outside of the European Union, we will ensure any such transfer complies with Chapter 5 of the GDPR.

<p><strong>14. Updating this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Please review the Privacy Policy regularly for updates. In the event Sharp makes a change, it will post a new effective date on the Privacy Policy.
