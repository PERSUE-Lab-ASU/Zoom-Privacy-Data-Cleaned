<h5>Third-Party Websites</h5>
<p>Our Website may contain links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. If an individual follows a link to a third-party website, please note that this policy does not apply to those websites. We are not responsible or liable for the privacy policies or practices of those websites, so please check their policies before submitting any personal data to those websites.</p>
<h5>The Categories of Personal Data</h5>
<p>We process the following categories of personal data:</p>
<p><strong>Customer Representative Data:</strong>&nbsp;A representative of a Customer (referred to in this policy as<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>“Customer Representative,”</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and an example of which may include, an employee of the Customer who manages the products and services the Customer receives from us) is required to provide us with personal data when they inquire about or agree to take a product or service from us on behalf of a Customer.&nbsp; This may include name, title, company name, IP address, physical address, location, phone number, email address, username, password, purchase information, payment method and bank details of the Customer.&nbsp; We need this information to be able to provide our products and services and run our business.</p>
<p><strong>User Data:<em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong>We are provided with details of the Users of our products and services so that we can allocate contact numbers to those Users.&nbsp; We also collect call data such as calling party number, called party number, date and time of call, duration (collectively referred to as<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>“Call Detail Records”</strong>), number of calls, quality, recipient, occasionally call recordings (if requested by our Customers, to monitor call quality or as otherwise legally permitted, which means retaining a .wav or .mp3 file of the call recording).&nbsp; Where we monitor calls, we may also collect personal data of call recipients.<span>&nbsp;Where we provide customers with a fax-to-email or email-to-fax service, we will process copies of any inbound and outbound fax messages during transmission.&nbsp;</span>Our Customers are responsible for ensuring that appropriate notices are provided and consents obtained (where necessary) for any monitoring that we carry out on their behalf, including processing call recordings.&nbsp; We need this information to be able to provide our products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Teams Managed Services:<em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong>Where we provide Microsoft Teams Managed Services to customers, we will collect and process data from the customer’s Microsoft Teams Tenant and their current PBX back-up. This includes, but is not limited to, user profile descriptions, location description (as populated within customer’s Active Directory), email addresses, contact numbers, and Direct Inward Dialling (DID) numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Number Portability Verification Data:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>In the event a Customer requests us to port numbers of their Users from an alternative provider to us, we will be required to collect and process Users’ original identity documents to prove the User’s address. We will receive a copy of the Users’ passport or other national ID document, which will include their name, address and date of birth of the User.</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry Data:</strong> When we are contacted with an enquiry or in response to a communication from us, we may be provided with certain personal data such as name, contact details and information contained in the correspondence (which could tell us something about the individual’s preferences).&nbsp; The individual contacting us is in control of the personal data and other information that they share with us. &nbsp;We need this information to be able to respond to the enquiry and to administer our business. In addition to enquiries being received from an individual (as defined above), we also receive enquiries from representatives of our partners and resellers.&nbsp; When we do, we may also be provided with their personal data (as described in this paragraph).</p>

<p><strong>To provide our products and services, administer Customer accounts, and run our business,</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>we use Customer Representative Data to process individual service orders and to process any application for services (e.g. on a pre- or post-paid contract), to maintain guarantee records, set up and maintain Customer accounts and to provide after-sales service.&nbsp; This includes carrying out security checks (this may involve passing Customer Representative Data to a credit reference agency, who will check the details we give them against public and private databases and may keep a record of that check to use in future security checks – this helps to protect our Customers and us from fraudulent transactions).&nbsp; A Customer Representative has the ability to manage the Customer’s products and services via our online portal, and requires us to process the Customer Representative’s Data in order to provide login details (including a username and password).</p>
<p>We monitor call quality to improve the service which we provide and use User Data to optimize our services and our Customers’ and their Users’ experience.&nbsp; We may also process User Data when monitoring calls to ensure compliance with our practices and procedures and where, for example, a contract is entered into to provide evidence of the transaction.&nbsp; We use User Data for troubleshooting purposes to resolve faults, incidents or debugging issues with our products and services, which may be identified by the User and submitted to us via our help desk, and we may also use User Data for providing fault, fraud and maintenance notifications to Users, all of which are necessary notifications in order for us to provide the products and services required by the Customer.</p>
<p>We have a legitimate interest to process the Customer Representative Data and User Data in order to provide products and services to our Customers and their Users, to administer Customer accounts and run our business.&nbsp; This legitimate interest extends to providing Customers with the products and services requested from us (including, for example, monitoring calls when a Customer selects this option) which is govern by a formal contract for services.</p>
<p>We also provide Customers with the option to port numbers of their Users from an alternative provider to us.&nbsp; In these circumstances we are required to verify the identity of Users and this requires us to process Number Portability Verification Data.&nbsp; We are required to carry out these checks, and process your Number Portability Verification Data, to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
<p><strong>To inform Customers about promotions and our products and services,</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>we may use Customer Representative Data and/or User Data to inform Customer Representatives and/or Users of information, promotions, products and services that may be of interest where we are legally permitted to do so (for example, where the contents of the communication relates to the same or similar products and services to those received by the Customer Representative and/or User) or where the Customer Representative and/or User has consented to receiving direct marketing from us (or a company similar to us). &nbsp;Customer Representatives and/or Users may be contacted by post, email, telephone or such other means as we regard as appropriate and as legally permitted.</p>
<p>We have a legitimate interest to process Customer Representative Data and/or User Data for direct marketing purposes or rely on consent as a basis for direct marketing where we are legally required to do so (this depends upon the relationship we have with the Customer Representative and/or User and the contents of our direct marketing).</p>
<p><strong>To meet legal or regulatory requirements,</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>we are required to comply with certain legal and regulatory requirements when providing our products and services and we may process personal data in order to comply with those requirements, which may include monitoring and recording communications. &nbsp;Occasionally, we may be asked to provide certain information to regulators or law enforcement agencies and we will comply with these requests where legally required or permitted.</p>
<p>This processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we, our Customers or the regulator/law enforcement agency are subject.</p>
<p><strong>To administer, maintain, and improve our Website</strong>, we use “cookies” to monitor Website Visitor traffic patterns and site usage. This helps us to understand how our Customers and potential Customers use our Website so that we can develop and improve the design, layout and functionality of the sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on the Website Visitor’s computer’s hard drive and which records their navigation of our Website so that, when the Website Visitor revisits our Website, it can present tailored options to them based upon the stored information about the Website Visitor’s last visit. &nbsp;A Website Visitor can normally alter the settings of their browser to prevent acceptance of cookies. If a Website Visitor does not want us to deploy cookies in their browser, a Website Visitor can set their browser to reject cookies or to notify them when our Website tries to put a cookie on the Website Visitor’s computer. However, rejecting cookies may affect the Website Visitor’s ability to use some of the products and/or services at our Website.</p>
<p>In addition to the information provided above, the following website provides information on deleting or controlling cookies and is available at<span>&nbsp;</span><u><a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org</a></u>.</p>
