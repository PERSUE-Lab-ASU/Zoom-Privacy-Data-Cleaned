Your privacy is important to us, and below is everything we are doing to make sure your data is safe, secure, and privacy protected. Please let us know if you have any questions or if there is anything we can do to improve your experience: support@gondola.ai</p><p class="mt-10">Gondola offers a next generation online travel agent that books travel for you the optimal way for your preferences and loyalty. This Privacy Policy describes Gondola's privacy practices and how we handle personal information that we collect through our website, our applications, and our other interactions and correspondence with you.</p><p class="mt-1">Before we describe the categories of personal information that we collect, use, and disclose, below we provide a short summary of how Gondola works and how Gondola integrates with and handles your data. </p><h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl">How Gondola Works</h3><p class="mt-1">Gondola creates a travel profile for you consisting of your past/future travel and a loyalty dashboard that is derived from your email and credit card data. To learn about your travel history, we will request permission to connect to your Gmail account to sync hotels that you've stayed in, flights you've taken, how many loyalty points you have, and other travel-related emails in your inbox. Using AI tools, we build your loyalty dashboard based on your travel-related information. If we need more details, we will ask for your permission to contact travel partners on your behalf to learn more about your loyalty status and rewards. Using the information we have collected, we will help you find the best hotel and airline rates and book trips on your behalf.</p><h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl">How We Collect, Use, and Disclose Information through the Gmail Integration</h3><p class="mt-1">With users' explicit permission, we use the Gmail API to access travel-related emails in your inbox.
