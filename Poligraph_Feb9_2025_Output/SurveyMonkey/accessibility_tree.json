This data is de-identified where possible. (c) Usage information. \u25e6 We use information about how you use our services to improve our services for you and all users and to make recommendations to you and your organization about our other services. \u25e6 For example: We collect information about the types of surveys/forms/applications you create (e.g., HR surveys), the types of plans you purchase and your account transactional behavior to build a profile about you so as to help direct you and your organization to other relevant features and services we offer and to optimize user experience, for example by making recommendations to you or your organization. \u25e6 We may also use usage information such as levels and nature of activity in your account and number of responses you are receiving to personalize the features and services we highlight for you and your organization in our Sites, improve user experience and to make recommendations to you and your organization about our services through our sales and marketing efforts. (d) Event data. \u25e6 We use events contained in log data for many different business purposes to include: \u25aa To create new services, features, content or make recommendations. \u25aa To track behavior at the aggregate/de-identified level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our services. \u25aa To fix bugs and troubleshoot product functionality. \u25aa To investigate security issues. \u25e6 For example: Your IP address is used to determine where an unknown/unauthorized access may have occurred in your account (abuse monitoring). (e) First party information. \u25e6 We process other aspects of your account information (like the personal information you provide about your job, your job title, and your marketing preferences) as well as information obtained from public sources, to provide you with a personalized experience and relevant and useful marketing information as well as to make other product, feature and service recommendations to you and your organization to optimize the use of the services we offer (where permitted by law).\u00a0 \u25e6 You can object to us using your information as described above but in some cases, our ability to fully and properly provide our services to you may be impacted if you do not want us to collect or use the above data.

(f) Third party information. \u25e6 \u00a0We combine information about you from third party sources (such as LinkedIn and ZoomInfo) with information we hold about you to create a user profile, which will help us to make our sales and marketing efforts more relevant to you and to personalize and improve your service experience.

(b) Cookies. \u25e6 We use required cookies to ensure the operation of a Creator\u2019s survey, form, application, or other SurveyMonkey product. These cookies are used to ensure that all aspects of the survey operate appropriately and optimally. For more information please read our Cookies section below and our Respondent Cookies Notice. \u25e6 Examples: We use page tags to allow the email sender (for a survey or form for example) to measure the performance of email messaging and to learn how to improve email deliverability and open rates. We also use cookies to ensure a respondent can only take a survey once (where the Creator has set this function) and to track completion rates of surveys. \u25e6 After completion of a survey, in most cases, you will be redirected to our website and treated as a website visitor where other cookies may be used so you should read our Website Visitor section if this is of interest to you. (c) Device and browser data. \u25e6 We use device data both to troubleshoot problems with our service and to make improvements to it.\u00a0 \u25e6 We use your device and browser data to provide our services to the Creator. For example: your IP address is used to ensure that you do not complete the same survey, form, application or questionnaire twice if the creator has included settings to avoid this (ballot stuffing). (d) Inferred geographic location. \u25e6 We also may infer your geographic location based on your IP address. This allows Creators to filter responses by inferred geographic location. Note: we do not collect precise (GPS) location.\u00a0 (e) Event data. \u25e6 We use event data for many different business purposes including the following: \u25aa To create and improve services, features, content or make recommendations; \u25aa To track behavior at the aggregate/de-identified level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our services; and \u25aa To fix bugs and troubleshoot product functionality. (f) Third parties and integration data. \u25e6 We will collect and use information from third parties and integration partners to facilitate Creators in sending surveys/forms/applications/questionnaires to you. (g) Survey response data. \u25e6 SurveyMonkey may use first party machine learning or third party artificial intelligence tools on data around the type of survey the Creator has sent you, the question type, survey responses (at an aggregated and de-identified/pseudonymized level only), and device and event data associated with responses to\u00a0 fulfill our contract with Creators and provide Creators with useful and relevant insights from the data they have collected using our services. Specifically, we use machine learning on survey data to help Creators by: \u25aa identifying trends in their responses;\u00a0 \u25aa ongoing training of models to optimize responses;\u00a0 \u25aa making product recommendations and providing guidance on which products and services work best in different scenarios (For an example of this check out how SurveyMonkey Genius works here); \u25aa Extracting and analyzing usage patterns, for example, we might identify when respondents prefer multiple choice versus open text questions and make predictive response suggestions when certain question types are selected. We might also use this data to help improve analysis of responses; \u25aa undertaking personalization for survey Creators;\u00a0 \u25aa improving user experience (for example, by collecting and using device and browser information from Respondents to improve how our survey service operates on those devices and in those browsers or by altering questions to match the responses being provided by a Respondent); and \u25aa identify insightful data trends (which do not disclose Personal Data) and make recommendations to Creators based on those trends. \u25e6 A Creator has some controls over how we use responses and may have opted-out of applying machine learning to responses where it is linked to a specific product feature in some cases.\u00a0 3.2.2 Legitimate Interests We process your personal information in the following categories of data for legitimate interests pursued by us. We have undertaken to ensure that we place clear limitations on each of these uses so that your privacy is respected and only the information necessary to achieve these legitimate aims is used. (a) Usage information. \u25e6 We use information about how you use our services to improve our services for you and all users and to make recommendations to our customers about usage of our services. \u25e6 For example: We collect information about the types of questions you answer. This data will be aggregated and/or de-identified where possible, so we can examine patterns in terms of respondent preferences when submitting responses. We collect and use all this data to help us improve our product so that questions are easier to answer and to help improve the completion rates on surveys/forms. \u25e6 We will also use information such as the type of survey, form, questionnaire or application that you answered to personalize products we show you on completion of a survey and to understand trends in our service adoption. See more about Customizing Survey End Page here). (b) Responses (in aggregated and/or de-identified form). \u25e6 To build new product features. (c) Inferred geographic location. \u25e6 We may infer your geographic location based on your IP address to produce aggregated data around Respondent location trends. We will use this information to compare and look at trends on how our service operates and how you interact with surveys, on different browsers and devices. Note: we do not collect precise (GPS) location. (d) Email address. \u25e6 Depending on your geographic location, we may share your email address in hashed form with marketing vendors to present personalized advertisements such as display, videos, and content on the web or connected devices. You can opt out via this portal. (e) Customer support information. \u25e6 We may use information provided to our Customer Support, Customer Success, and Sales teams such as name, email, and message content to train machine learning models to better predict customer support question type, provide answers, generate insights about customer support trends, and to improve our Customer Support for our Customer. This data is de-identified where possible. 3.2.3 Legal obligation (a) To respond to legal requests, we may need to disclose information we hold about you. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond. (b) We may also use usage data, event data, and aggregated or de-identified survey questions and responses: \u25e6 To enforce our agreements where applicable; \u25e6 To investigate security issues; \u25e6 To prevent or address potentially unlawful activities; and \u25e6 To screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity .
