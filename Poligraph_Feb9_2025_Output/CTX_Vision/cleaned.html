<ul>
<li>Browser information</li>
<li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
<li>Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>
<li>Aggregated information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Collect Other Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Through your browser: Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version. We use this information to ensure that our Site functions properly.</li>
<li>Using cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on your computer. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Site, pages visited and language preferences. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while visiting the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes. We also use cookies to gather statistical information about the usage of the Site in order to continually improve the design and functionality, understand how customers use it, and to resolve questions about it. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allow you to decline the use of cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, some or all of the features, functionality, and promotions available through the Site may not be available to you.</li>
<li>Using pixel tags and other similar technologies: Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates.</li>
<li><a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/">IP Address</a>: Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.</li>
<li>From you: Information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, is collected when you voluntarily provide this information. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose Other Information</strong></p>
<p>Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat this information as Personal Information under applicable law, then, in addition to the uses listed in the “How We Collect Other Information” section above, we may use and disclose Other Information for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.</p>
<p>In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location).

CROSStrax is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about each Privacy Shield Framework, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List</a>.</p>
<p>CROSStrax is responsible for the processing of personal data it transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf when such data has been received under the EU – U.S. and Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, to the extent provided by the EU – U.S. and Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks. We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, CROSStrax is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, CROSStrax may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at&nbsp;<a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint">the Privacy Shield website</a>, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Disclosures for EEA Data Subjects:</strong></p>
<p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Sites and CROSStrax Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need it to provide or operate the Sites and CROSStrax Services, including to provide customer support and process your orders, requests, questions and concerns;</li>
<li>It satisfies another legitimate interest that is not overridden by your data protection interests, including our interest in:
<ul>
<li>collecting product usage, analytics and performance data relating to our Sites and the CROSStrax Services, in order to maintain, analyze, develop, update, and improve our products and services;</li>
<li>maintaining records of bugs, customer support requests and similar requests you file, and our response to these requests;</li>
<li>using information to personalize content and features on our Sites and the CROSStrax Services;</li>
<li>detecting, investigating and preventing activities that may violate our policies or applicable laws (such as fraud detection and prevention);</li>
<li>maintaining corporate or business records consistent with our retention policies and applicable laws;</li>
<li>protecting against activities that may threaten the security, integrity, or availability of our or another party’s products, systems, and services; and</li>
<li>for marketing and selling our products and services, consistent with applicable laws.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We are processing your information to protect our legal rights;</li>
<li>You give us consent to process your personal data;</li>
<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation, such as a lawful subpoena or law-enforcement request or to fulfill the lawful instructions of our customers (when they are acting as the controller); and/or</li>
<li>We have another lawful basis for processing in accordance with applicable EU laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an individual in the EEA has consented to our use of their personal information, and our processing is based on that consent, that individual has the right to withdraw their consent in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”), but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, individuals in the EEA have the right to object to that use as specified in Article 21 of the GDPR, though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Sites or CROSStrax Service. CROSStrax further acknowledges that EEA data subjects have certain other rights under the GDPR, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and to request from the controller access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data, restriction of processing concerning the data subject, and data portability (in each case, as specified under the GDPR). Where CROSStrax is acting as a controller, you can initiate a request by contacting us as specified in the “Contacting Us” section below. Please note that if you object to or restrict processing, you may not be able to use the Sites and CROSStrax Services or certain features any longer.</p>
<p>EEA and Swiss data subjects can contact CROSStrax’s data protection officer by emailing info@crosstrax.co.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track and Cross-Site Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user activates the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. For information about Do Not Track, visit <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/privacy/www.allaboutdnt.org">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>. At this time, we do not respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals. In addition, some of the other third-party services and tools on our Site and/or the CROSStrax Service, may use standard technologies, such as cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons, to collect information about your internet activities across websites. You may be able to disable certain third-party cross-site tracking as described in the “Your Choices” section above.</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention Period</strong></p>
<p>We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.</p>
