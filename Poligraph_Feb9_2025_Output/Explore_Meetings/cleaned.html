Customers also have the option to add their phone number, job title, country of residence, and other details to their profile information. We keep track of Customers’ preferences when Customer selects settings within our Services.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Content that Customers provide through the Services: </strong>When Customers use our Services, we collect, store and process information and content that Customers post, send, receive, or share.
