No matter where you are located, you consent to the processing and transferring\n    of your information in and to the U.S. and other countries.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>\n    Dreamaker takes security seriously. We take various steps to protect information you provide to us from loss, misuse, and\n    unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process\n    and store, and the current state of technology.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Public forums</h3>\n<p>\n    Dreamaker may provide its users with chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups. Please remember that any information\n    disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal\n    information. \n</p>\n\n<h3>External links</h3>\n<p>\n    The Dreamaker web site may contain links to other Internet web sites. We encourage all of our partners, contributors and\n    third parties to implement policies and practices that respect the privacy of our users. However, Dreamaker is not responsible\n    for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information\n    we collect from the visitors. To the extent that visitors disclose information to other parties whether they are linked\n    from the Dreamaker web site, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed\n    to them. Because Dreamaker does not control the privacy policies of third parties, our visitors are subject to the privacy\n    customs and policies of that third party. We encourage our visitors to ask questions before disclosing personal information\n    to others.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Children\u2019s privacy</h3>\n<p>\n    Dreamaker understands the importance of protecting children\u2019s privacy in the interactive, online world. Dreamaker does not\n    intentionally target or solicit to children thirteen (13) or younger for purposes of collecting personal information.\n    Our Services may link to certain web sites which may target or solicit to children thirteen (13) or younger and may collect\n    personal information. Those web sites are not governed by this privacy policy, but will (or should) have their own privacy\n    policies that more fully explain how they respect and protect the privacy of children while providing them information,\n    goods or Services. Please consult the \n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html\">\n        FTC's site\n    </a>  for more tips on protecting children\u2019s privacy online.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Amendments and updates</h3>\n<p>\n    We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we will post any changes on this page.
