<h3>How and why we use your information</h3>
<p>We may use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Honoring our contractual commitments to you.</strong> Much of our processing of information we collect is to meet
        our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users’ request in anticipation of entering into a contract
        with them. For example, we handle personal data on this basis to create your account and provide our Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Technical Administration.</strong> To provide, maintain, protect and improve our Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Services functionality.</strong> To monitor and analyze use in order to increase our Service’s functionality and
        user-friendliness; and to tailor our Service to you. For example, by recalling your preferences when using the Service.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customer support.</strong> To process your inquiries and otherwise deliver customer service.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Payment processing.</strong> To process your payments, we share and use your information as described in the section 
        <b><a href="#payment-information">Payment Information</a></b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Security.</strong> To control unauthorized access, use or abuse of our Services, or otherwise detect, investigate
        or prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customer communication.</strong> To communicate directly with you, including by sending you Services updates, newsletters,
        promotions and special offers or information about new products and services.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h3>Who we share your data with</h3>
<p>
    We do not sell, trade, share or transfer your personal information to third parties except in the following limited circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Business transfers.</strong> We may share your personal information with our parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates.
        In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, bankruptcy, dissolution or similar event, your information
        may be part of the transferred assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Payment processing.</strong> We share your Payment Information to process your payments, as further described in
        <b><a href="#payment-information">Payment Information</a></b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Service providers.</strong> We share your data with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like
        messaging, communication, marketing and advertising services, email and hosting services, and customer services and
        support. These service providers may access your personal data and are required to use it solely as we direct, to
        provide our requested service. For example, we share your information with Intercom (www.intercom.com) to provide
        you with our Support and Help Center.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data analytics and enrichment services.</strong> As part of our use of third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics
        and data enrichment services like Heap, we share certain de-identified data as needed. De-identified data means data
        where we’ve removed personal information like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows
        these providers to provide analytics services to provide, maintain, protect and improve our Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consent.</strong> We may share your personal information with a third party if we have your consent to do so.

        <strong>Your collaborators.</strong> We share your name, email address and location with people you invite to collaborate
        in your projects or with whom you share media to let them know who has invited them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Legal requirements.</strong> We may share your personal information when we have a good faith belief that access,
        use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
        legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce a Customer Agreement, including investigation of potential
        violations thereof, or (c) protect against imminent harm to our rights, property or safety, or that of our users
        or the public as required or permitted by law.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Security requirements.</strong> We may share your personal information with third parties (including our service
        providers and government entities) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security or technical issues.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>External links</h3>
<p>
    The Dreamaker web site may contain links to other Internet web sites. We encourage all of our partners, contributors and
    third parties to implement policies and practices that respect the privacy of our users. However, Dreamaker is not responsible
    for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information
    we collect from the visitors. To the extent that visitors disclose information to other parties whether they are linked
    from the Dreamaker web site, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed
    to them. Because Dreamaker does not control the privacy policies of third parties, our visitors are subject to the privacy
    customs and policies of that third party. We encourage our visitors to ask questions before disclosing personal information
    to others.

<h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
<p>
    Dreamaker understands the importance of protecting children’s privacy in the interactive, online world. Dreamaker does not
    intentionally target or solicit to children thirteen (13) or younger for purposes of collecting personal information.
    Our Services may link to certain web sites which may target or solicit to children thirteen (13) or younger and may collect
    personal information. Those web sites are not governed by this privacy policy, but will (or should) have their own privacy
    policies that more fully explain how they respect and protect the privacy of children while providing them information,
    goods or Services. Please consult the 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html">
        FTC's site
    </a>  for more tips on protecting children’s privacy online.
</p>

<h3>Amendments and updates</h3>
<p>
    We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we will post any changes on this page. If you continue to use the
    Services after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy.
</p>

<h3>Terms of Service and Policies</h3>
<p>
    If you choose to use our Services, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and our
    <a href="=&quot;terms&quot;">Terms of Service</a>, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the
    State of Oregon. If you have any concern about privacy at Dreamaker, please contact us and we will try to resolve it.
    Our business changes constantly. This Policy and the
    <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a> will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Policy
    in effect at the time of use. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our policies and conditions, unless you have instructed
    us not to, but you should check our web site frequently to see recent changes.
