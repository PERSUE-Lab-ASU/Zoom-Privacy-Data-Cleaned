In this policy, we layout: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will. This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Salesroom Inc.</p><div id=\"what-we-collect-and-why\"><h2>What we collect and why</h2><p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here\u2019s what that means in practice:</p><div id=\"identity-and-access\"><h3>Identity &amp; access</h3><p>When you sign up for Salesroom, we typically ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, company name, and profile picture. That\u2019s just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you, updates, or other essential information. We\u2019ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won\u2019t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.</p></div><div id=\"geolocation-data\"><h3>Geolocation data</h3><p>We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can always verify no unauthorized access has happened. We keep this login data for as long as your product account is active. We also log full IP addresses used to sign up for a product account. Web analytics data \u2014 described further in the Website Interactions section \u2014are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases.</p></div><div id=\"website-interactions\"><h3>Website interactions</h3><p>When you browse our applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We track specific link clicks and sometimes track your activity on pages to help inform our design decisions as we develop Services (especially while in Beta). These web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account if applicable and you are signed in to our Services.</p><p>See our <a href=\"https://www.salesroom.com/subprocessors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Subprocessors </a>list for the third-party tracking tools we use.</p></div><div id=\"cookies-and-do-not-track\"><h3>Cookies and Do Not Track</h3><p>We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and support analytics.

Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your express consent</p></div><div id=\"information-we-do-not-collect\"><h3>Information we do not collect</h3><p>We don\u2019t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as when using our profiles feature or in your email signature when writing into our Support team.</p><p>We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to add a picture to your user profile, which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile pictures: they are for your use alone.</p></div></div><div id=\"your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information\"><h2>Your rights with respect to your information</h2><p>At Salesroom, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently, some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), the UK's General Data Protection Regulation (\"UK GDPR\"), the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (\"FDAP\"), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) in the US. Salesroom recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold.

Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Salesroom services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li><li><strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to <a href=\"https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</li><li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restrictions of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of the sale of personal information.

This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for the performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li></ul><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right \u201cto be forgotten\u201d) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent from using our Services.</li></ul><p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.</p><p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.

Anything you trash on your product accounts while they are active may be kept but not accessible. We also have some backups of our application databases, which are kept for up to another 30 days.
