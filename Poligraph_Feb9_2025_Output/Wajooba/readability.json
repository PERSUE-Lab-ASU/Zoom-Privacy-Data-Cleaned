Before accessing or using our Service, please ensure that you have read, and understood our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms And Conditions.\nWhy do we have a Privacy Policy? What is it for? Does anyone read it? All those answers will follow soon.\n\n\nThis Policy shall supplement our Terms and Conditions of Service (the \u201cTerms\u201d), along with any other guidelines and policies provided by us from time to time, all incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n\nHere at Wajooba, we work hard to earn and keep your trust; and therefore we adhere to the following principles in order to protect your privacy:\n\nWe will not sell or lease your PI to third parties.We will not disclose your PI with other users or third parties without your consent.Any PI that you provide to Wajooba will be secured with industry standard safety protocols and technology.\n\n\n\nAs used herein and elsewhere, the words \u201ccollect\u201d, \u201cuse\u201d, \u201cprocess\u201d, \u201ctreat\u201d, \u201cdisclose\u201d and analogous shall be related to your PI and other data that we may receive from our clients, users and/or visitors, including cookies inside a computer and mobile device IDs.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2.

Well, yes.\n\n\nIn order to use the Service, you may or will need to disclose PI to us, including but not limited to: your name, last name, IP address, email, phone number, gender, date of birth, address and postal/zip code. In addition, we offer certain payment functionalities, which require that certain third party payment processing platforms collect sensitive financial information of our users (e.g. credit card and payment information).\nWe know most people never read the legal of websites, and that perhaps only our main clients, investors, their attorneys and the most hardcore of our users will ever read them. In any case, it doesn\u2019t hurt to read this, so please, we invite you to read this Policy carefully before providing any information to us.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3.

We will retain your PI for as long as needed to provide the applicable Service you use, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. In case of secure databases under our control where deletion becomes impossible, we will make such information inaccessible.

If that is the case, please contact such third parties directly in order to request enforcement of your privacy rights.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t7.

Our service providers do not have any right to use your PI or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us in order to provide the products or Service requested by you.

A CEM is a message in an electronic format (e.g. email, SMS, push notifications and other form of communications) which is then sent to an electronic address (e.g. email, mobile device) and that contains a message asking recipients to participate in commercial activities (e.g. purchase of products, Service and invitations to participate in user research).\n\n\nOur optional email newsletters are considered CEMs, and therefore you may subscribe or unsubscribe from them at will, usually on your account settings, or by following the unsubscribe links contained therein.

Cookies are small text files that our Service transfers to you and that allow us permit us to recognize you and obtain data such as how, when and how long you browse pages in our Service. We also use the so-called \u2018beacons\u2019, which are small files, sometimes only a pixel in size, embedded onto the pages of our Service. Beacons are used to identify each of our pages in order to be analyzed by our system tools.\nThe cookies we talk to are not cookies for children, or chocolate cookies, but rather a silly term coined by nerds back in the 90s to describe small text files that websites place in your browser when you visit them.\n\n\nWhen you access our Service via a mobile device, we will use your mobile device ID (i.e. the unique identifier assigned to a mobile device by the manufacturer) and/or Advertising ID (for Apple iOS 6 and later) instead of cookies in order to recognize you, track the number of relevant ads displayed, their performance and display.\n\n\n\nWe may also collect and use the data contained in log files, which may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the browser you used to visit our Service, the time you visited our Service and which pages you visited throughout our Service.\nOur cookies are flavor free, and do not collect personally identifiable information from you.\n\n\nYou can always configure your browser to refuse cookies and beacons. For more information, please visit www.allaboutcookies.com. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, but you can select to reset your Advertising IDs in the \u201cSettings\u201d section of your mobile device, among other settings.\nIf you do not agree to this use of cookies, please disable them. Or eat them. Actually, we are surprised no one has coined a better term than \u2018cookies\u2019 by now.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t14. Third party Services\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nour Service may display hyperlinks to the websites of our commercial partners and other third parties. If you click on such links, you are choosing to visit such websites, and will be redirected there. Please take into consideration that we are not responsible for the privacy and personal data practices undertook by such third parties (including any tools, cookies, information or content contained thereunto), and that we do not have control over the manner in which such third-parties may collect, process, treat or use your PI.\nYou can\u2019t really blame us if some company selling you $10 plane tickets to Thailand floods your emails with offers, even if you got there from one of the many links inside our Service. As always, exit at your own risk!\n\n\nWhen you use such links to go to another website, our Policy and Terms are no longer into effect and your browsing thereof is in your own and final risk. In addition, any banner or ad that we may have on our Service does not constitute any endorsement of any third party thereof.\nIt is so easy to read like this, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t15.

These ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history, and may include retargeting codes. For example, third party vendors may show you Wajooba\u2019s ads on certain websites across the Internet, even after you leave our Service. The collected information is anonymized, meaning it cannot be tracked back to individuals. Using such tools, we learn how to optimize, and serve ads based on a user\u2019s past visits, providing you with a better user experience.\nWhy should you care about this? Why would you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content? Well, you have a right to privacy dude, and if you are not interested, or you didn\u2019t know, well then you know that we DO care. If in doubt, please contact the responsible provider directly, or quit using the Internet altogether, or learn how to brose the deep web so you don\u2019t get tracked by anyone. Except the NSA, who, you know, reads all emails and data sent over the web. NSA =bad guys. Wajooba = nice guys.\n\n\nOur third party vendors may also use cookies and beacons to track your Internet browsing in order to serve you ads based on what they or us believe to be of interest according to your browsing activities and consumer preferences.
