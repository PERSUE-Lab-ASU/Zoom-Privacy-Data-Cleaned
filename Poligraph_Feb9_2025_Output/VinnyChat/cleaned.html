<p style="text-align: left;">You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our websites or services. To opt-out from tracking by Google Analytics, please use the specific opt-out mechanism as indicated further below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also use web beacons on our websites. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites. Such tracking technologies are used to operate and improve our websites and email communications and track the clicking of links or opening of emails.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Vincere also contracts with third party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons (see below) on our websites, from emails, and on third-party websites. Advertising networks follow your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services by collecting device and usage data through automated means, including through the use of cookies. These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a desktop or laptop computer, smartphone or tablet. Third parties use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see their advertisements on other websites or mobile applications on any of your devices. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4.3 Notices on behavioral advertising and opt-out</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As described above, we or third parties may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser when you visit our websites for the purposes of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “online behavioral advertising” or “interest-based advertising”). To learn more about targeted advertising, advertising networks and your ability to opt out of collection by certain third parties, please visit the opt -out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative, <a rel="noopener" href="https://thenai.org/" target="_blank">here</a>, and the Digital Advertising Alliance, <a rel="noopener" href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To manage the use of targeting or advertising cookies on this website, consult your individual browser settings for cookies. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4.4 Opt-Out from the collection of device and usage data</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may opt-out from the collection of device and usage data (see "What device and usage data we process" section above) by managing your cookies at the individual browser level. In addition, if you wish to opt-out of interest -based advertising contact us. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies and similar technologies used on our websites, you may not be able to take full advantage of the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard that has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to our websites. Vincere takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>

You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on a website to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by the respective social media network or hosted directly on our website. To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the respective social media networks, the latter may receive information that you have visited our website from your IP address. If you are logged into your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit of our websites with your social media profile.</p>
