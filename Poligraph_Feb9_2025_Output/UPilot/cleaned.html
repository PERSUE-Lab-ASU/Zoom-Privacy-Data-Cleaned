<p>These terms of service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of UPilot and its affiliates’ (“UPilot”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) Web sites and the related applications and services offered by the Company under the “UPilot” brand, and the “UPilot” applications and services are accessible via the Company Web site listed below or through Google Play™ or the Apple iTunes App StoreSM (the “UPilot Services” or our “Services”).</p>
<p>By accepting these Terms, either by clicking a box indicating your acceptance, accessing or using the UPilot Services, or by executing an order form that references these Terms (an “Order Form”), you agree to all of the terms set forth herein. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and representing that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.</p>
<p>You may use the Services only in accordance with these Terms. You may use the Services only if you have the legal power and capacity to form a contract with the Company. The Services will continue to evolve as we refine features and functionality. We may terminate, suspend, or modify the Services, in general or with respect to you, from time to time without cause or prior notice. We may also delete any content or data from the Services at our discretion.</p>
<p>If you have entered into or enter into a master subscription agreement with UPilot INC, for Services other than UPilot, that master subscription agreement shall not apply to the UPilot Services, and UPilot Services shall not be considered a service or product or part of any service or product under such master subscription agreement, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by us.</p>
<p>You may not access the UPilot Services if you are our direct competitor, except with our prior written consent. In addition, you may not access the UPilot Services for purposes of monitoring their availability, performance or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes.</p>
<h3 id="terms_of_use_1" style="--fontSize: 26; line-height: 1.3; --minFontSize: 26;" data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33.8px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">Free Trial</h3>
<p>If you register on our website for a free trial, we will make one or more services available to you on a trial basis free of charge until the earlier of (a) the end of the free trial period for which you registered to use the UPilot Service, or (b) the start date of any purchased service subscriptions ordered by you for the UPilot Service. Additional trial terms and conditions may appear on the trial registration web page. Any such additional terms and conditions are incorporated into these Terms by reference and are legally binding.</p>
<p>If you elect to use the UPilot services for the trial period and do not purchase a subscription before the end of the trial period, your trial subscription for the UPilot services will expire at the end of the trial period and shall not auto-renew. Any data entered into the UPilot services by you or received by you in connection with your use of the UPilot services, and any customizations that may have been made to the UPilot services by you during the free trial period, will be permanently lost unless you purchase a subscription to the UPilot services before the end of the trial period.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, during the free trial the UPilot services are provided “as-is”, “as-available”, without any warranty or support whatsoever.</p>

<p>In order to use our UPilot Services you must link a 3rd party email account to your UPilot Services account. With your permission (which you are granting by using the Services), we will create and update versions of your address book and emails for you to access using the UPilot Services. You will also have the option to import and update versions of your calendar, social media contacts, and mobile phone call history, and you can later choose to upload files to or provide comments through the UPilot Services. This data, along with any electronic data and information submitted by or for you to the UPilot Services, including electronic data and information submitted by or for you through your use of third party applications, or collected and processed by or for you using the UPilot Services (excluding information obtained by the Company from our content licensors or publicly available sources and provided to you, or otherwise provided by the Company to you in connection with the UPilot Services) is referred to as “Your Data.” You retain full ownership to Your Data. We do not claim any ownership to any of it. You grant the Company a worldwide, perpetual license to host, copy, transmit and display Your Data as necessary for the Company to provide the UPilot Services in accordance with these Terms.&nbsp; The foregoing licenses each include all necessary rights and licenses to incorporate Your Data into the UPilot Services’ Indexed Content, as the term is defined in our Privacy Policy, and by acceptance of these Terms, you direct the Company to incorporate Your Data into such Indexed Content. If we are required by a licensor to remove Indexed Content, or receive information that Indexed Content provided to you may violate applicable law or third-party rights, we may so notify you and in such event you will promptly remove such content from your systems.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of Your Data and your communications with others while using the Services. For example, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have all rights and permissions needed to comply with these Terms and to avoid infringement or violation of any rights of others. You will be responsible for your users’ compliance with these Terms and will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of Services, and notify us promptly of any such unauthorized access or use.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that the Company has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services and that we are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, safety or legality of Your Data or any other information or content you may be able to access using the Services.</p>
<p>If you install or enable any third-party application for use with the UPilot Service (e.g., Google, Facebook), you grant us permission to allow the provider of that application to access Your Data as required for the interoperation of that third-party application with the UPilot Service. We are not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Your Data resulting from access by a third-party application.</p>

<p>Subject to the limited exceptions specified in our Privacy Policy, until you choose otherwise, all of Your Data remains visible only to you. However, the Services do allow you to share Your Data with others. If you choose to share Your Data, we cannot be responsible for what those other users do with Your Data, so please carefully consider what you share and with whom you share it.</p>
<p>We will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for&nbsp;protection&nbsp;of the security,&nbsp;confidentiality&nbsp;and integrity of Your Data as described in our Privacy Policy. We do not guarantee that Your Data will be free from loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection if you wish to protect Your Data when you are transmitting it to us and to keep your own backup copies of Your Data. You are solely responsible for protecting your passwords, limiting access to your computers and devices, and signing out of the UPilot Services when you are not using them.</p>

Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (i) fees are based on Services purchased and not actual usage, (ii) payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable, and (iii) quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant subscription term. Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever.

You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by us regarding future functionality or features.</p>

Subject to these Terms, the Company hereby grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable,&nbsp;non&nbsp;sublicensable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. This license will be automatically revoked if you violate these Terms. We reserve all rights not explicitly granted in these Terms. You must not attempt to reverse engineer the Software or encourage or assist anyone else to do so; however, this restriction will not prohibit reverse engineering for interoperability in the European Union to the extent European Union law forbids such a restriction. The Services may automatically update the Software on your device when a new version becomes available. Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, we and our licensors reserve all of our/their right,&nbsp;title&nbsp;and interest in and to the UPilot Services and Software, including all of our/their related intellectual property rights.

If we suspend or terminate your use, we will try to let you know in advance and help you retrieve data, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly or flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or danger to other users) where we may suspend or terminate your account and access to the UPilot Services immediately. You acknowledge that if your access to the Service is suspended or terminated, you may no longer have access to Your Data that is stored&nbsp;with&nbsp;the Service.</p>

<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will&nbsp;UPilot, UPilot INC&nbsp;or either of their subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable for (a) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential (including loss of use, data, business, or profits) damages, regardless of legal theory, whether or not UPilot has been warned of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose; (b) aggregate liability for all claims relating to the services more than the greater of $20 or the amounts paid by you to UPilot for the past three months of the services in question. Some states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>

<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. We will notify you of any change (for example via email to the email address associated with your account or by a notification when you sign in or by some other method).

<h3 id="terms_of_use_14" style="--fontSize: 26; line-height: 1.3; --minFontSize: 26;" data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33.8px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h3>
<p>These terms and the use of the services and software will be governed by California law&nbsp;except for its conflicts of laws principles. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services or software must be litigated exclusively in the courts in San Francisco, California, and both parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.<br>
This Agreement is the entire agreement between You and the Company regarding Your use of Services and Content and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence shall be: (1) the applicable Order Form, (2) the applicable service agreement, and (3) this Agreement.</p>
<p>These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. The Company’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted to reflect our intent as closely as possible.

<p>This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of the Company’s Web sites that link to this Privacy Statement, including www.upilot.com (collectively referred to as the “Company’s Web sites”). The Company’s Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. The information practices or the content of such other Web sites are governed by the privacy statements of such other Web sites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement also covers the use of the UPilot Service through applications on Devices and APIs. A “Device” is any device used to access the UPilot Service, including without limitation a computer, mobile phone, tablet, or&nbsp;other electronic device. By using our Services you are consenting to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND STORE</p>
<p>UPilot INC collects individually-identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from individuals who visit the Company’s Web sites (“Web Site Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Services (“Customers”). When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, UPilot INC may require you to provide the Company with personal contact information, including your name, company name, phone number, and email address (“Required Contact Information”). When purchasing the Services, UPilot INC may require you to provide the Company with Financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Services (“Billing Information”). UPilot INC may also ask you to provide, or otherwise allow you to share, additional information, which you may choose to share in your registration for or use of the Services (“Optional Information”). For example, UPilot INC may obtain Optional Information by asking a Customer to import his or her contacts and email history by granting UPilot INC access to the Customer’s third party services (for example, the Customer’s email account) or to use the Customer’s social networking information if the Customer gives us access to his or her account on a social network service. In order to use the UPilot Service, a Customer must link a third party email account to the Customer’s UPilot Service account. We then import, create, and update versions of the Customer’s address book and emails for the Customer to access&nbsp;in&nbsp;the UPilot Service. A Customer will also have the option to import and update versions of his or her calendar, social media contacts, and mobile phone call history, and the Customer can later choose to upload files to, or provide comments through, our Services. Required Contact Information, Billing Information, and Optional Information about Customers are referred to collectively as “Data About Customers”. With your permission (which you grant by signing up for or using our Services), UPilot INC collects and stores information you provide or that we collect in order to administer our Services and/or as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement or our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>As you navigate the Company’s Web sites or use the Services, UPilot INC may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, HTTP header information, and the actions you take on the Company’s Web sites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). For additional information about the collection of Web Site Navigational Information by UPilot INC and others, please review Section 3 of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<h4 id="privacy_policy_2_3" style="--fontSize: 21; line-height: 1.42; --minFontSize: 21;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="29.8167px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">3. Web Site Navigational Information</h4>
<p>UPilot INC uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information from your Device as you navigate the Company’s Web sites, interact with e-mails sent by the Company on its own behalf, or use the Services (“Web Site Navigational Information”).

<p>UPilot INC uses cookies and Javascript to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, open e-mail from the Company, or use the Services online, UPilot INC’s servers or an authorized third party may send a cookie to your Device. Cookies allow the Company to track overall Web site usage, to determine areas that Visitors prefer, and to make your visits to the Company’s Web sites easier by recognizing you and providing you with a customized experience. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to UPilot INC, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me”), you remain anonymous to the Company.

Please note that if you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but the functionality and features of the Services may be affected, and you may not be able to successfully use the Services. Similarly, if you disable JavaScript, some features of the Company’s Web sites may not function properly, and some areas of the Company’s Web sites may not function at all.

<p>Cookies that are used as part of the Services (in the proxy) may include cookies of a third party Web site that is being co-browsed, for example, in order to deliver the Web site as intended by the third party Web site operator. The cookie practices of such Web sites are governed by their own respective privacy statements. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.</p>

<p>UPilot INC, or third parties with whom we contract, may use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Web Site Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your&nbsp;Device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web&nbsp;beacon,&nbsp;and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, UPilot INC may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites. UPilot INC uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites and email communications and track the clicking of links or opening of emails.</p>
<h5 id="privacy_policy_2_3_3" style="--fontSize: 19; line-height: 1.4; --minFontSize: 19;" data-fontsize="19" data-lineheight="26.6px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">IP ADDRESSES, URLS, AND OTHER SITE DATA</h5>
<p>Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Company’s Web sites, we automatically receive the URL of the Web site from which you came and the Web site to which you go when you leave the Company’s Web sites. We also receive your Device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your Device’s operating system, the type of Web browser you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (ISP). We may also collect information about the web page visited before or after you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata, and interactions with the Service. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Service and to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, UPilot INC uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Web Site Visitors navigate the Company’s Web sites.</p>

<p>The Company’s Web sites may use social media features, such as the Facebook ‘like’ button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Company’s Web sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option&nbsp;by&nbsp;such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on the Company’s Web sites to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party Social Media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company’s Web sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.</p>
<h5 id="privacy_policy_2_3_5" style="--fontSize: 19; line-height: 1.4; --minFontSize: 19;" data-fontsize="19" data-lineheight="26.6px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">DO NOT TRACK</h5>
<p>Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting. UPilot INC does not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to the Company’s Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. UPilot INC takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
<h4 id="privacy_policy_2_4" style="--fontSize: 21; line-height: 1.42; --minFontSize: 21;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="29.8167px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">4. Use of Information Collected</h4>

<p>Data About Customers. Data About Customers is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Services, (ii) to administer your use of our Services, (iii) to recommend follow-up reminders, assign tasks, or personalize the service, and (iv) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us that are not required for the Service, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings information.</p>
<p>Geo-Location Information. Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your Device as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services and to optimize your experience. Some of the information we do currently collect from a device, such as the Device’s IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.</p>
<p>Analytics. We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) that requires using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Data About Customers. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the UPilot Service, for the UPilot Service’s technical administration, to increase our Services’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for our Services to process their requests.</p>
<h5 id="privacy_policy_2_4_2" style="--fontSize: 19; line-height: 1.4; --minFontSize: 19;" data-fontsize="19" data-lineheight="26.6px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">SHARING OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h5>
<p>No Sale of Data About Customers. We do not sell Data About Customers to third parties.</p>
<p>Service Providers, Business&nbsp;Partners&nbsp;and Others. We may use certain trusted third-party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the UPilot Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of our Services’ features). These third parties may have access to your information for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>Third-Party Applications. UPilot may share information you have provided with a third-party application (for example when you choose to access our Services through an application such as the Google Chrome extension). We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy that is acceptable to you.</p>
<p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of UPilot INC’s Rights. We may disclose to third parties data stored in your UPilot Service account and information about you that we collect or have collected when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation, or compulsory legal request, such as to comply with a subpoena; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of UPilot INC or its users; or (d) to protect UPilot INC’s rights. If we provide any data stored in your UPilot Service account to a law enforcement agency, we will remove our encryption from the information before providing it to law enforcement. However, UPilot INC will not be able to decrypt anything that you encrypted prior to uploading it to UPilot INC.</p>
<p>Business Transfers. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets where UPilot INC is not a surviving entity, information we have collected about may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email, sign in notification, and/or a prominent notice on our website) if that happens or if your information otherwise becomes subject to a different privacy policy in lieu of this one. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the treatment of the information.</p>

<p>All transactions for UPilot are carried out in USD, and the subscriber will be charged in USD for any payments made. The subscriber must take note to confirm with their bank/credit card company in order to check any additional charges will be levied for making payments in USD.</p>
<p>UPilot will not be responsible for any charges arising out of payments wherein the default currency of the&nbsp;card/bank&nbsp;used for the payment is not USD.</p>

<p>Your 14-Day Free Trial period begins on the date your order is placed.</p>
<p>After the trial period, once your payment starts, you will be automatically billed monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the chosen billing cycle of monthly, quarterly, or annually respectively. The charges will occur in advance for the billing cycle. Once you have been charged for the billing cycle, a refund will not be possible in any of the billing cycle options. If you cancel your subscription to UPilot before the end of your billing cycle, you will not be charged for any subsequent cycle. In case of a discount code, unless specified, the discount code is valid only for the first billing cycle and you will be charged normal rates in subsequent cycles.</p>
<p>A subscription is considered canceled if and only if the customer has conveyed the same through support@upilot.com&nbsp;atleast&nbsp;72 hours before the end of the billing cycle.</p>

<p>When you sign-up for a free trial of UPilot, you can receive 14 days of free UPilot apps access. You have the option of paying during your free trial or after the end of your free trial.</p>
<h3 id="billing_4" style="--fontSize: 26; line-height: 1.3; --minFontSize: 26;" data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33.8px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">Upgrade or downgrade your plan</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise specified herein or in an applicable Order Form, You can upgrade to a new plan at any time or You can downgrade your plan at any time only if an inferior pricing plan exists.<br>
For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.<br>
Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. UPilot INC does not accept any liability for such loss.<br>
Please also note that you are limited&nbsp;at&nbsp;one upgrade or downgrade operation per month.<br>
Once a billing cycle has been initiated, it is not possible to change the time frame of the cycle, i.e. if you have selected an annual time frame for the billing cycle, it cannot be changed to quarterly, monthly, and vice versa. This is due to a restriction of our payment partner,&nbsp;braintreepayments&nbsp;(https://www.braintreepayments.com/). The restriction also applies during downgrading or upgrading your plan as well.<br>
During the free trial, an upgrade or downgrade of the plan will lead to a cancellation of the free trial, and you will be asked to pay according to the new plan. In such a situation, the billing date would be on the date that you place the order for upgrade or downgrade of the plan and not the date your free trial was started.</p>
