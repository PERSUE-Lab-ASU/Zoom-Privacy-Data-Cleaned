It also depends on whether you are a\n<b>\u201cCustomer\u201d</b>\ncontracting directly with us or a\n<b>\u201cClient\u201d</b>\nbooking an appointment with a Customer. We collect data about you in various ways when you use our products,\nincluding data you provide directly, data collected automatically, and third-party data sources.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Data you provide directly</u>.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe collect personal data you provide to us when, for example, you: schedule an appointment; sign up for and use\nour Services; consult with our Customer Service team; integrate our Services with another website or service (such\nas, when a Customer embeds the scheduler on their own website); and communicate with us in any way.\n</p>\n<p>\nInformation you provide directly to us includes:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Contact information</b>,\nsuch as name, physical address, email address, phone number.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Payment information</b>,\nincluding credit card number and other payment details.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Content and files</b>,\nsuch as the photos, documents, or other files you upload to our Services and the content of\nyour communications with us.\n</li>\n<li>\nOther details you chose to provide when scheduling your appointment.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<u>Data we collect automatically</u>.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs further described in the\n\"<b>Cookies, Mobile IDs, and Similar Technologies</b>\"\nsection below, when you use our Services, some data is collected automatically.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, when you visit our websites, our web servers automatically log:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Identifiers and device information</b>,\nincluding your computer's operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Geolocation data</b>,\nsuch as city, state, and country, depending on your device or app settings.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Usage data</b>,\nsuch as the website you visited before our site, access times, and your activity on our websites.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<u>Data we create or generate</u>.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics\n(\"<b>inferences</b>\").\nFor example, we infer your general geographic location (such as city, state, and country) based on your IP\naddress.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Data we obtain from third-party sources</u>.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe obtain data from third parties.

A cookie can later be\nread when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie\ncontains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information\nas well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.\n</p>\n<p>\nWeb beacons are electronic images (also called\n\"<b>single-pixel</b>\"\nor\n\"<b>clear GIFs</b>\")\nthat are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web\nbeacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party).\nThis allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same\nway, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser\nconnecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content. We also include web beacons in our email\nmessages or newsletters to tell us if you open and act on them.\n</p>\n<p>\nMobile analytics and advertising IDs are generated by operating systems for mobile devices (iOS and Android) and\ncan be accessed and used by apps in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. Our apps contain\nsoftware that enables us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to access these mobile IDs.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>How do we and our partners use cookies, mobile IDs, and similar technologies</u>?\n</p>\n<p>\nWe, and our analytics and advertising partners, use these technologies in our websites, apps, and online services\nto collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage\ninformation, identifiers, and device information) when you use our Services, including personal information about\nyour online activities over time and across different websites or online services.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis information is used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our websites\nand apps perform, track your interaction with the site or app, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other\nlegitimate purposes. We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for\nthese purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe third-party analytics and advertising providers we use on our websites can be found at\n<a href=\"https://www.schedulista.com/legal/sub-processors\">https://www.schedulista.com/legal/sub-processors</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>What controls are available</u>?\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Advertising controls</b>.\nOur advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting,\nwhich you can access at:\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>United States</u>:\nNAI\n(<a href=\"http://optout.networkadvertising.org/\">http://optout.networkadvertising.org</a>)\nand DAA\n(<a href=\"http://optout.aboutads.info/\">http://optout.aboutads.info/</a>)\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Canada</u>:\nDigital Advertising Alliance of Canada\n(<a href=\"https://youradchoices.ca/\">https://youradchoices.ca/</a>)\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Europe</u>:\nEuropean Digital Advertising Alliance\n(<a href=\"http://www.youronlinechoices.com/\">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>)\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThese choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or\nbrowsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you\nuse those systems.\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Browser cookie controls</b>.\nMost web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to\nlearn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain\nfeatures or Services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by\nthose cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Mobile analytics and advertising ID controls</b>.\niOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the analytics IDs.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Email web beacons</b>.\nMost email services have settings which allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including web\nbeacons, which prevents the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Do Not Track</b>.\nSome browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\"\n(\"<b>DNT</b>\")\nfeatures that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because\nthere is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to\nbrowser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including\nthe cookie controls and advertising controls described above.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how\">HOW WE USE YOUR DATA</h3>\n<p>\nWe need to know your personal data to perform the functions of our Services and to provide you the Services you\nrequest.

When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web\nbeacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party).\nThis allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same\nway, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser\nconnecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content. We also include web beacons in our email\nmessages or newsletters to tell us if you open and act on them.\n\n\nMobile analytics and advertising IDs are generated by operating systems for mobile devices (iOS and Android) and\ncan be accessed and used by apps in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. Our apps contain\nsoftware that enables us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to access these mobile IDs.\n\n\nHow do we and our partners use cookies, mobile IDs, and similar technologies?\n\n\nWe, and our analytics and advertising partners, use these technologies in our websites, apps, and online services\nto collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage\ninformation, identifiers, and device information) when you use our Services, including personal information about\nyour online activities over time and across different websites or online services.\n\n\nThis information is used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our websites\nand apps perform, track your interaction with the site or app, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other\nlegitimate purposes. We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for\nthese purposes.\n\n\nThe third-party analytics and advertising providers we use on our websites can be found at\nhttps://www.schedulista.com/legal/sub-processors.\n\n\nWhat controls are available?\n\n\n\nAdvertising controls.\nOur advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting,\nwhich you can access at:\n\n\n\nUnited States:\nNAI\n(http://optout.networkadvertising.org)\nand DAA\n(http://optout.aboutads.info/)\n\n\nCanada:\nDigital Advertising Alliance of Canada\n(https://youradchoices.ca/)\n\n\nEurope:\nEuropean Digital Advertising Alliance\n(http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)\n\n\n\nThese choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or\nbrowsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you\nuse those systems.\n\n\nBrowser cookie controls.\nMost web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to\nlearn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain\nfeatures or Services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by\nthose cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.\n\n\nMobile analytics and advertising ID controls.\niOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the analytics IDs.\n\n\nEmail web beacons.\nMost email services have settings which allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including web\nbeacons, which prevents the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images.\n\n\nDo Not Track.\nSome browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\"\n(\"DNT\")\nfeatures that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because\nthere is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to\nbrowser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including\nthe cookie controls and advertising controls described above.\n\n\nHOW WE USE YOUR DATA\n\nWe need to know your personal data to perform the functions of our Services and to provide you the Services you\nrequest.
