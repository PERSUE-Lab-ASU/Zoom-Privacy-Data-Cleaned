</ul>
<p><strong>Who has access to the information collected?</strong><br>
Learning Stream and its customers — information is used only by organizations hosting events using learningstream.com.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery services possibly not sharing our privacy policy</strong><br>
Of the information we do collect, we allow our visitors the following access to the information:</p>
<p><strong>Access is given to all collected information</strong><br>
If you believe that our website has collected incorrect information or if you would like to dispute any information, please contact us using the information below.</p>
<p>This privacy statement applies to the website of:<br>

<p><strong>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></p>
<p>The data controller responsible for your personal information for purposes of the applicable European Union data protection law is:<br>
Learning Stream<br>

Suite 500<br>
Charlotte, NC 28208<br>
(800) 560-1617</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal data, you may contact us at the address above. Or you may use <strong><a href="https://reg.learningstream.com/s_reg/reg_registration_maintenance.aspx?ek=0003-0003-4F6F0F511A414C378F45F3D5207E70AC">this form</a></strong> to request the removal of your personal data from our system. Please allow no more than 30 days for removal of data to occur.</p>
<p><strong>How we use your data</strong><br>
Learning Stream’s customers use the software to collect information from registrants for purposes of training, classes, meetings, and other events. We process this information as part of binding agreements with our customers who then offer their services to their customers (employees, customers, or to the general public). Their customers request access to those services via online forms.<br>
As part of the registration process, Learning Stream customers will send messages such as confirmation, wait list, and reminder emails. You may opt out of these messages.</p>
<p><strong>No data sharing</strong><br>
Learning Stream does not sell or share personal information collected via its online forms. Only customers that request such information via online forms can access it.</p>
<p><strong>Third-country transfer</strong><br>
If you are within the EU and you complete a Learning Stream form, you are transferring data to a third country (U.S.A.). The European Commission has determined the U.S.A. provides an “adequate level of data protection.” This assumes the company is within the Privacy Shield Framework, which Learning Stream is.</p>
<p><strong>How long we retain your data</strong><br>
When a customer no longer uses Learning Stream for data collection, Learning Stream purges all data associated with that account. The customer also has the means to purge data while the account remains active.<br>
• Your rights as the data provider<br>
You have the right to know what Learning Stream does with your data. This privacy policy outlines that.<br>
• You have the right to access your data at any time.<br>
• You may request removal of your data at any time. To do so, you may contact the Learning Stream customer that uses our system to collect your data. You may also contact Learning Stream directly using <strong><a href="https://reg.learningstream.com/s_reg/reg_registration_maintenance.aspx?ek=0003-0003-4F6F0F511A414C378F45F3D5207E70AC">this form</a></strong> or by writing us using the address listed above.<br>
• You may also file a complaint any time directly with Learning Stream using <strong><a href="https://reg.learningstream.com/s_reg/reg_registration_maintenance.aspx?ek=0003-0003-4F6F0F511A414C378F45F3D5207E70AC">this form</a></strong> or the above address.<br>
• You have the right to rectify any personal information you believe is incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawing your consent</strong><br>
Should you withdraw your consent, which was previously given, you may do so at any time. Any information collected prior to your withdrawing consent would still be considered lawful. You should also contact the Learning Stream customer which collected your data via online forms.</p>
