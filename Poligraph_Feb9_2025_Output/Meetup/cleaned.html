<p><strong>2.4 Legal Basis for Processing</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in a jurisdiction that requires a specific legal basis for processing personal data, our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the type of information and the specific context in which we collect it.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We process information about you in order to provide our services in accordance with our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027447252"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms of Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, to allow you to join groups or to display your profile to other members; to allow us to send you important service updates; and to perform a contract.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes you provide us with sensitive information about you; for instance, the mere fact of joining a certain group may indicate information about your health, religion, political views, or sexual identity.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process information about you, or may otherwise need the information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

<p><strong>3.1 Through Our Platform</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We share some of the information that we collect by displaying it on our Platform according to your member profile and account settings. Some information, such as username, is always public. Some information, such as interests, is public by default, but can be hidden on our Platform. Some information, such as group memberships, will always be visible to other members of that Meetup group, and may be public, depending on the settings of that group. We recommend that you check the group settings and what information will be available before joining the group to ensure that you are happy with the information that is visible to others. For more information, see this article on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001655712"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account Privacy and Visibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and this article on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002921751"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Group Content Visibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information that is public on our Platform is visible to others on and off the Platform.</span></p>
<p><strong>3.2 Group Networks</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a member of a group, this group may now or in the future become part of a network of groups known as a “Meetup Pro” network. Members who administer a Meetup Pro network, known as “network administrators” have access to the content within their groups, including information about group participants. Network administrators find it helpful to have access to the email addresses of organizers and other members of groups within their networks, to easily communicate with and administer the groups. Therefore, we will provide ways for you to share your email address with your group’s network administrator. See this article for more information about&nbsp;</span><a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002797432"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Network Administrators, Organizers, and their Members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>3.3 With Our Service Providers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use service providers in connection with operating and improving the Platform to assist with certain business purposes, such as payment processing, email transmission, conducting surveys or contests, data hosting, managing our ads, and some aspects of our technical and customer support. These service providers, which include data analytics providers (as discussed further in Section 3.5 below), may access, process, and store information about you on our behalf for the purposes we authorize, subject to confidentiality obligations.</span></p>
<p><strong>3.4 With our Analytics and Advertising Partners</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share information we have collected about you with others or allow others to use technologies (like cookies, web beacons, and device identifiers) that collect information about your use of the Platform and other websites and online services, to provide analytic services and to serve ads for Meetup.&nbsp; For example, our Platform is affiliated with Freestar for the purposes of placing advertising on the Platform, and Freestar, will collect and use certain data for advertising purposes. To learn more about Freestar’s data usage, click </span><a href="https://freestar.com/privacy-policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. See our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/cookie_policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookie Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;for details about these technologies and the information that they collect, use, or share, including how you may be able to control or disable these services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on where you live, you may have the right to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information for purposes of targeted advertising (targeting ads based on consumer activity across other sites and services). Meetup provides you the opportunity to opt-out of this sharing, as described in Section 5 below.</span></p>
<p><strong>3.5 Following The Law And Protecting Meetup</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may access, preserve, and disclose information about you to government entities and other third parties, including the content of messages, if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or audits. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027447252"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms of Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;or related guidelines and policies, or if necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of, or prevent fraud or abuse of, Meetup or others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>3.6 Social Sharing And Other Tools</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Platform may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions that you take on our Platform with third-party services, and vice versa. Such features let you share information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you have chosen with the service. For more information, see this article on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882691"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing Meetup events on Social Media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and this article on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002878451"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting your Social Media Account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The third-party services' use of the information will be governed by the third parties’ privacy policies, and we do not control the third parties’ use of the shared data. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please review the privacy policies of the services that provide these features.</span></p>
<p><strong>3.7 Affiliate Sharing And Merger, Sale, Or Other Asset Transfers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Meetup is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of our assets, information about you may be shared, sold, or transferred as part of that transaction. We may also share information about you with current or future corporate parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.</span></p>
<p><strong>3.8 Other Situations</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may de-identify or aggregate information about you and share it freely, so that you can no longer be identified. Such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also share information about you with your consent or at your direction or where we are legally entitled to do so. For example, your information may be shared with event sponsors and others as described to you when you RSVP to an event.&nbsp; Your information also is made available to other group members and event organizers when you RSVP for and participate in an event.&nbsp;</span></p>

</ol>
<p><strong>4.1 Transfer Of Information To The U.S. And Other Countries</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meetup is based in the United States</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Information about you will be transferred to, and processed in, the U.S. and countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective. We have taken appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses, to require that your information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><strong>4.2 Security</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We employ technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information that is under our control and that we process on your behalf from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, we store all information that you provide to us on servers on which security controls are used. We train employees regarding our data privacy policies and procedures, and authorize employees to access personal information as required for their role. We use firewalls designed to protect against intruders and test for network vulnerabilities. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where you have a password, which enables you to use our services, you are responsible for keeping this password complex, secure, and confidential. If you would like to update or change your password, you may select the “Forgot your password?” link on the login page. You will be sent an email that allows you to reset your password.</span></p>

<p><strong>4.4 Policy Scope</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you have provided or made accessible to third parties, such as other members, including group organizers and network administrators, and others with whom you may share information about yourself. Our Platform may direct you to a third-party service, such as social media services, or a portion of our Platform may be controlled by a third party (typically through the use of a frame or pop-up window separate from other content on our Platform). Disclosure of information to these third parties is subject to the relevant third party’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the third-party privacy policy or content, even if we link to those services from our Platform or if we share information with these third parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members, including group organizers and network administrators, are directly responsible for complying with all requirements of applicable privacy laws in connection with the information that they obtain and process for the purposes of managing their contacts, organizing and communicating with groups, or administering networks.</span></p>

<h2 id="h_01GKS69KWBZ6YYA53WD5FZFYTJ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. California Privacy Rights</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the preceding 12 months, Meetup has collected, used, and shared the categories of personal information described above in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;We do not consider the ways we share your information as a “sale” for purposes of California law.&nbsp;California residents have certain rights to access, correct and delete their personal information and to request transparency about our privacy practices.&nbsp; If you would like to access or delete your information, or otherwise exercise your rights under the CCPA, please see Section 6. Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity, including by asking you for additional information. If you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services for exercising your rights unless those differences are permitted by law.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a California resident and would like to use an agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do-Not-Track Signals</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some mobile and web browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We currently do not take action in response to these signals.</span></p>
