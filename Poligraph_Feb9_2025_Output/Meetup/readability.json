Some information, such as username, is always public. Some information, such as interests, is public by default, but can be hidden on our Platform. Some information, such as group memberships, will always be visible to other members of that Meetup group, and may be public, depending on the settings of that group. We recommend that you check the group settings and what information will be available before joining the group to ensure that you are happy with the information that is visible to others.

Members who administer a Meetup Pro network, known as \u201cnetwork administrators\u201d have access to the content within their groups, including information about group participants. Network administrators find it helpful to have access to the email addresses of organizers and other members of groups within their networks, to easily communicate with and administer the groups. Therefore, we will provide ways for you to share your email address with your group\u2019s network administrator.

These service providers, which include data analytics providers (as discussed further in Section 3.5 below), may access, process, and store information about you on our behalf for the purposes we authorize, subject to confidentiality obligations.</span></p>\n<p><strong>3.4 With our Analytics and Advertising Partners</strong></p>\n<p><span>We may share information we have collected about you with others or allow others to use technologies (like cookies, web beacons, and device identifiers) that collect information about your use of the Platform and other websites and online services, to provide analytic services and to serve ads for Meetup.&nbsp; For example, our Platform is affiliated with Freestar for the purposes of placing advertising on the Platform, and Freestar, will collect and use certain data for advertising purposes.

Meetup provides you the opportunity to opt-out of this sharing, as described in Section 5 below.</span></p>\n<p><strong>3.5 Following The Law And Protecting Meetup</strong></p>\n<p><span>We may access, preserve, and disclose information about you to government entities and other third parties, including the content of messages, if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or audits. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027447252\"><span>Terms of Service</span></a><span>&nbsp;or related guidelines and policies, or if necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of, or prevent fraud or abuse of, Meetup or others.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>3.6 Social Sharing And Other Tools</strong></p>\n<p><span>The Platform may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions that you take on our Platform with third-party services, and vice versa. Such features let you share information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you have chosen with the service. For more information, see this article on&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882691\"><span>Sharing Meetup events on Social Media</span></a><span>&nbsp;and this article on&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002878451\"><span>Connecting your Social Media Account</span></a><span>. The third-party services' use of the information will be governed by the third parties\u2019 privacy policies, and we do not control the third parties\u2019 use of the shared data. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please review the privacy policies of the services that provide these features.</span></p>\n<p><strong>3.7 Affiliate Sharing And Merger, Sale, Or Other Asset Transfers</strong></p>\n<p><span>If Meetup is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of our assets, information about you may be shared, sold, or transferred as part of that transaction. We may also share information about you with current or future corporate parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.</span></p>\n<p><strong>3.8 Other Situations</strong></p>\n<p><span>We may de-identify or aggregate information about you and share it freely, so that you can no longer be identified. Such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</span></p>\n<p><span>We may also share information about you with your consent or at your direction or where we are legally entitled to do so. For example, your information may be shared with event sponsors and others as described to you when you RSVP to an event.&nbsp; Your information also is made available to other group members and event organizers when you RSVP for and participate in an event.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GKS694F8AM4TSYP8QVP7EABH\"><span>4.

Joining such groups or posting information on the Platform about these topics is entirely voluntary and, depending on the settings of the group and your profile (e.g., public or private), our legal basis for processing any sensitive information is either that you manifestly make it public or your explicit consent.\nIn some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process information about you, or may otherwise need the information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. For example, we may process information, if we believe doing so is required by, or in accordance with, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or audits.\n\n3. Sharing Of Information\nSummary: We do not share information about you except as described in this Privacy Policy.\u00a0We may disclose personal information about you, including:\n\n\nto members or social media services, depending on how you engage with the Platform.\u00a0 Information that is public on our platform is accessible to others both on and off the Platform;\nto our third-party service providers who help us to operate or improve our Platform;\nwhen we work with third parties for analytics and to deliver targeted advertising to you on and off the Platform.\u00a0 For more information, please see our Cookie Policy;\nto authorities to comply with legal obligations or requests and to protect and defend our rights and property;\u00a0\nto an affiliate or successor entity or otherwise as part of a corporate transaction;\u00a0\namong our businesses and affiliated companies; and\nwhen you direct us to share your information.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe may also share information in a manner that does not identify you, such as de-identified or aggregated information. Such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.\n3.1 Through Our Platform\nWe share some of the information that we collect by displaying it on our Platform according to your member profile and account settings. Some information, such as username, is always public. Some information, such as interests, is public by default, but can be hidden on our Platform. Some information, such as group memberships, will always be visible to other members of that Meetup group, and may be public, depending on the settings of that group. We recommend that you check the group settings and what information will be available before joining the group to ensure that you are happy with the information that is visible to others. For more information, see this article on\u00a0Account Privacy and Visibility\u00a0and this article on\u00a0Group Content Visibility.\u00a0\nInformation that is public on our Platform is visible to others on and off the Platform.\n3.2 Group Networks\nIf you are a member of a group, this group may now or in the future become part of a network of groups known as a \u201cMeetup Pro\u201d network. Members who administer a Meetup Pro network, known as \u201cnetwork administrators\u201d have access to the content within their groups, including information about group participants. Network administrators find it helpful to have access to the email addresses of organizers and other members of groups within their networks, to easily communicate with and administer the groups. Therefore, we will provide ways for you to share your email address with your group\u2019s network administrator. See this article for more information about\u00a0Network Administrators, Organizers, and their Members.\n3.3 With Our Service Providers\nWe may use service providers in connection with operating and improving the Platform to assist with certain business purposes, such as payment processing, email transmission, conducting surveys or contests, data hosting, managing our ads, and some aspects of our technical and customer support. These service providers, which include data analytics providers (as discussed further in Section 3.5 below), may access, process, and store information about you on our behalf for the purposes we authorize, subject to confidentiality obligations.\n3.4 With our Analytics and Advertising Partners\nWe may share information we have collected about you with others or allow others to use technologies (like cookies, web beacons, and device identifiers) that collect information about your use of the Platform and other websites and online services, to provide analytic services and to serve ads for Meetup.\u00a0 For example, our Platform is affiliated with Freestar for the purposes of placing advertising on the Platform, and Freestar, will collect and use certain data for advertising purposes. To learn more about Freestar\u2019s data usage, click here. See our\u00a0Cookie Policy\u00a0for details about these technologies and the information that they collect, use, or share, including how you may be able to control or disable these services.\nDepending on where you live, you may have the right to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information for purposes of targeted advertising (targeting ads based on consumer activity across other sites and services). Meetup provides you the opportunity to opt-out of this sharing, as described in Section 5 below.\n3.5 Following The Law And Protecting Meetup\nWe may access, preserve, and disclose information about you to government entities and other third parties, including the content of messages, if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or audits. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0or related guidelines and policies, or if necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of, or prevent fraud or abuse of, Meetup or others.\u00a0\n3.6 Social Sharing And Other Tools\nThe Platform may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions that you take on our Platform with third-party services, and vice versa.
