organizations other than iDecisiongames ("Third Party Sites") &nbsp;
that we believe may be of interest to you. We do not disclose &nbsp;
your Personally Identifiable Information to these Third Party &nbsp;
Sites without obtaining your consent. We do not endorse and are &nbsp;
not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party &nbsp;
Sites. If you choose to click on a link to one of these Third Party &nbsp;
Sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on the other &nbsp;
site to understand how that Third Party Site collects and uses &nbsp;
your Personally Identifiable Information.</span><h2>Retention of Personally Identifiable Information</h2><span>If you reside or are located in the EEA, we keep your Personally &nbsp;
Identifiable Information for no longer than necessary for the &nbsp;
purposes for which the Personally Identifiable Information is &nbsp;
processed. The length of time we retain Personally Identifiable &nbsp;

secure and will not share it with third parties, except as &nbsp;
otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless such &nbsp;
disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical &nbsp;
threat to you or others, as permitted by applicable law. Because &nbsp;
the Internet is not a 100% secure environment we cannot guarantee &nbsp;
the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there &nbsp;
is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to &nbsp;
circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your &nbsp;
information over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your &nbsp;
responsibility to protect the security of your login information. &nbsp;
Please note that e-mails communications are typically not encrypted &nbsp;

&nbsp;Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable &nbsp;
Information and confirm that it remains correct and up-to-date &nbsp;
or choose whether or not you wish to receive material from us or &nbsp;
some of our partners by logging into the Site and visiting your &nbsp;

relation to your rights or would like to exercise any of them, &nbsp;

our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Keep &nbsp;
in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will &nbsp;
remain within our databases, access logs and other records, which &nbsp;
may or may not contain your Personally Identifiable Information. &nbsp;
 Please also note that certain Personally Identifiable Information &nbsp;
may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, which &nbsp;
may include if we need to keep processing your Personally &nbsp;
Identifiable Information to comply with a legal obligation. &nbsp;
When you email us with a request, we may ask that you provide us &nbsp;
with information necessary to confirm your identity.</span><h2>International Privacy Practices</h2><span>iDecisiongames’s Sites are primarily operated and managed on &nbsp;
servers located and operated within the United States. In order &nbsp;
to provide our products and services to you, we may send and store &nbsp;
your Personally Identifiable Information (also commonly referred to &nbsp;
as personal data) outside of the country where you reside or are &nbsp;
located, including to the United States. Accordingly, if you reside &nbsp;
or are located outside of the United States, your Personally &nbsp;
Identifiable Information may be transferred outside of the country &nbsp;
where you reside or are located, including to countries that may &nbsp;
not or do not provide the same level of protection for your &nbsp;
Personally Identifiable Information. We are committed to &nbsp;
protecting the privacy and confidentiality of Personally &nbsp;
Identifiable Information when it is transferred. If you reside or &nbsp;
are located within the EEA and such transfers occur, we take &nbsp;
appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for &nbsp;
the processing carried out in any such countries as you would have &nbsp;
within the EEA to the extent feasible under applicable law. We &nbsp;
participate in and commit to adhering to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield &nbsp;
Framework when transferring data from the EEA to the United States.</span><h2>Changing Our Privacy Policy</h2><span>Please note that we review our privacy practices from time to time, &nbsp;

upon learning of the existence of such Personally Identifiable &nbsp;
Information.</span><h1>Privacy Shield Policy</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><span>iDecisiongames, Inc. (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), &nbsp;
believes in protecting your privacy. We participate in and commit &nbsp;
to adhering to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework which includes &nbsp;
the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, &nbsp;
security, data integrity, access and enforcement (the "Principles") &nbsp;
for all transfers of personal data from EEA to the U.S. When we use &nbsp;
the term "Sensitive Personal Information" in this Privacy Shield &nbsp;
Policy, we are referring to a particular subset of an individual’s &nbsp;
Personal Information that provides details of his or her race, &nbsp;
ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or &nbsp;
philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership or that concerns &nbsp;
his or her health. The purpose of this Privacy Shield Policy is to &nbsp;
outline our general practices for implementing the Principles with &nbsp;
respect to the Personal Information we collect. If you would like &nbsp;
to obtain additional information regarding our privacy practices in &nbsp;
connection with information collected on this website in general, &nbsp;
please refer to our online Privacy Policy.</span><h2>Principles</h2><span><strong>1. Notice.</strong>&nbsp;
We will provide you with timely and appropriate notice in our Terms &nbsp;
of Use and Privacy Policy, describing what Personal Information we &nbsp;
are collecting, how we will use that information, and the types of &nbsp;
third parties with whom we may share such information (and &nbsp;
the reasons we do so). Please review these documents carefully. &nbsp;
Where we process personal data on behalf of our business partners, &nbsp;
we will work with them to help them provide appropriate notice to you.<br><br><strong>2. Choice.</strong>&nbsp;
 We will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal &nbsp;
Information (or to provide explicit consent for Sensitive Personal &nbsp;
Information) being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than a &nbsp;
service provider as set forth below); or (ii) used for a purpose &nbsp;
materially different from the purpose for which it was originally &nbsp;
collected (as set out in our Privacy Policy), or subsequently &nbsp;
authorized by you, when the circumstances arise. You also have the &nbsp;
ability to opt out at any time from the use of your personal &nbsp;
information for direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right, &nbsp;
please check your settings options. Where we process personal data &nbsp;
on behalf of our business partners, we will work with them to &nbsp;
ensure you are offered appropriate choices (and means to exercise &nbsp;
those choices) for limiting use or disclosure of your personal data &nbsp;
(where appropriate). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that &nbsp;
we may disclose Personal Information under the following &nbsp;
circumstances without offering you an opportunity to opt out of &nbsp;
such disclosure: (i) to our partner institutions and other service &nbsp;
providers that we have retained to perform requested services on &nbsp;
our behalf; (ii) if we are required to do so by law or legal &nbsp;
process; (iii) pursuant to valid requests by law enforcement or &nbsp;
other government authorities (which we are legally required to &nbsp;
respond to); and (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary to &nbsp;
prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an &nbsp;
investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. In addition, &nbsp;
we reserve the right to transfer Personal Information in the event &nbsp;
we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets &nbsp;
(including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or &nbsp;
liquidation). Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use &nbsp;
reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the Personal &nbsp;
Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Shield Policy.<br><br><strong>3. Onward Transfers (Transfer to Third Parties).</strong>&nbsp;
We will only transfer Personal Information to third parties where &nbsp;
the third party: (i) has provided satisfactory assurances to us &nbsp;
that it will protect the Personal Information in accordance with &nbsp;
this Privacy Shield Policy and the Principles; (ii) is located in &nbsp;
the EU or a country considered "adequate" for privacy by the EU &nbsp;
Commission, and therefore is required to comply with the EU data &nbsp;
protection laws or substantially equivalent privacy laws; or (iii) &nbsp;
has certified to Privacy Shield, and is independently responsible &nbsp;
for complying with the Principles. Where we have knowledge that a &nbsp;
third party to whom we have provided Personal Information is &nbsp;
processing that Personal Information in a manner contrary to this &nbsp;
Privacy Shield Policy or the Principles, we will take reasonable &nbsp;
steps to prevent or terminate processing by the third party until &nbsp;
such time the third party can process Personal Information in &nbsp;
compliance with this Privacy Shield Policy and the Principles. &nbsp;
