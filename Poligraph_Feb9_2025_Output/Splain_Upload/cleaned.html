                      <p> The premise of Splain is to keep most of the User Experience within the collaboration platform (Zoom, Workplace, Teams, Spark) you are using. Splain makes an effort to store the minimum amount of data for the best possible User Experience as well as analytics to improve the Splain experience.</p>
                      <h5> Zoom Stored Data </h5>
                      <p> None of your data is stored in Splain unless you provide authorization by installing Splain app in your collaboration platform. The data that is passed to Splain by the collaboration platform is stored, so that interaction with the collaboration platform API is possible. The data that is stored in Splain include the access token, recording and transcript metadata, account id and the end user Email. Note that Splain do not store actual media content other than passing it to the drives for upload or CMS.</p>
					  <h5> Google/YouTube Data </h5>
					  <p> Splain does not store user/customer's credentials like username and password. Splain stores only the access &amp; refresh tokens and folder id (for Google Drive upload) of the user/customer. Those data are stored in a separate mySQL server which is running as a separate server in AWS. The app doesn't store any other user data such as username, email, video file,  etc. The tokens used to access the customerâ€™s Google account and the folder id used to identify the folder where the Zoom recording will be uploaded. The database/database server can be accessed only from our AWS AMI using secured connection. </p>
					  <p> The sensitive data like tokens are stored securely(encrypted) in mySQL server which can be only accessed from our Amazon AMI.</p>
					  <p> The user/customer data is not processed by Splain. Splain gets it from Zoom cloud and uploads it to the user/customers's YouTube channel/Google Drive. The user/customer has full control on how it will be created and stored in the Zoom cloud. None of the user data is collected from the user's/customer's device. Only the tokens which are given by Google/YouTube only.</p>
					  <p> Splain doesn't share any data including the user data to anyone internally or external/third party.</p>
					  <p> The user data will be deleted from our database servers when the user/customer terminates the service.</p>
					  <h5> Handling Google/YouTube data </h5> 
					  <p> Splain doesn't refresh/update or delete the Google/YouTube data/content including the video, and its attributes. In case of YouTube, Splain gets the video, title from Zoom cloud and privacy setting from user configuration and uploads it to the user/customer's channel. Once uploaded, Splain doesn't do anything with Google/YouTube data, not even read it from YouTube/Google.</p>
                      <h5> Explicitly NOT stored data </h5>
                      <p> Splain do not store any of your media content in its plaform. </p>
                      <h5> Analytics </h5>
                      <p> Splain uses analytics tools such as Google Analytics, New Relic, Opbeat, Mixpanel and Keen to monitor performance and to improve the user experience. </p>
                      <h5> Third Party Services </h5>
