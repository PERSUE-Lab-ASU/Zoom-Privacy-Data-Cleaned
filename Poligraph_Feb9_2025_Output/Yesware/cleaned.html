If you are outside the United States when you visit the Site or engage in communications with a Yesware agent via mail, e-mail or telephone, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. As you are contracting for the Services with Yesware, which is a US company, any information you provide to us, or that we collect through your use of the Services and that is necessary to provide you with the Services, will be stored, processed, and transferred within, or to, the United States. Please be aware that the US and jurisdictions other than the one in which you are located may have a lower or different standard of data protection laws compared to your own jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We partner with one or more third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-Personal Data about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a>, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (Google). Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze how you use the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the USA. We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that your IP address will be shortened before being sent to a Google server. Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate your use of the website in order to provide us with reports on the activities of users on the website and to provide other services related to the use of the website and internet usage. Furthermore, Google will transfer this information to third parties if required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google. The IP address provided by your browser will not be merged with Google’s other data. You may object to Google Analytics collecting the data with effect for the future by installing a deactivation add-on (<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>) for your browser. We only use Google Analytics in device mode, which means that if you disable Javascript, Google Analytics will not collect any data about your use of our website.</p>

<h3>End Users and Customers from the EEA/UK (“Europe”)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All EEA and UK-based individuals, irrespective of their nationality, have certain individual rights under the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act, such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. The right to be informed </strong>about the collection and use of their personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. The right of access </strong>to find out that is stored about them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. The right to rectification </strong>of their personal data if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. The right to erasure</strong>to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. The right to restrict processing </strong>to ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6. The right to data portability </strong>allowing individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7. The right to object </strong>to the processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling), direct marketing and/or for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Various rights in relation to <strong>automated decision making </strong>(making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement) and profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Yesware does not offer goods or services directly to data subjects in Europe (Art. 3 (2) GDPR), Yesware will abide by the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act and provide an adequate level of data protection for personal data received from the EEA/UK and processed, according the privacy protection set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would like to exercise these rights, please submit a request at&nbsp;<a href="https://help.yesware.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">help.yesware.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">Yesware may receive personal data from data subjects in Europe in the following instances: The data subject in Europe contacts Yesware directly and provides the personal data voluntarily, or</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: large;">Yesware obtains access to personal data of such data subjects through its business partners, who are data controllers or data processors.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In the latter case, Yesware will enter into aa data processing agreement (Art. 28 GDPR) with Yesware being the processor or sub-processor of such data controller/processor. In these cases, the data controllers or processors remain primarily responsible for the European personal data that they send or make available to Yesware. To the extent that such data (sub-)processing requires a data transfer from the EEA or U.K., Yesware has &nbsp;entered into a EU Standard Contractual Clauses for processors with the data controller (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesware is aware of the “<em>Schrems 2</em>” decision of the European Court of Justice (Case 311-18) and will take the appropriate measures together with the data controllers for its compliance. Although Yesware does not rely on the EU/US Privacy Shield as a legal basis for transfers of personal in light of this judgment, for as long as Yesware remains self-certified to the Privacy Shield: (i) Yesware agrees to process EU personal data in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) if Yesware is unable to comply with this requirement, Yesware will inform you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, if and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction or supervisory authority orders (for whatever reason) that the measures described in this Privacy Policy cannot be relied on to lawfully transfer European personal data, Yesware may implement any additional measures that may be required to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a matter of general practice, Yesware does not voluntarily provide government agencies or authorities (including law enforcement) with access to or information about Yesware accounts (including Customer Data). If Yesware receives a compulsory request (whether through a subpoena, court order, search warrant, or other valid legal process) from any government agency or authority (including law enforcement) for access to or information about a Yesware account (including Customer Data) belonging to a Customer whose primary contact information indicates the Customer is located in Europe, Yesware will notify the data controller via email sent to the controller’s primary contact email address of the request to allow the data controller to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesware shall not be required to comply with this obligation if it is legally prohibited from doing so, or it has a reasonable and good-faith belief that urgent access is necessary to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to any individual, public safety, or Yesware’s property, our Sites, or Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
