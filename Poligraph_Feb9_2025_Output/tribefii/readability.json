Visitor and User Information\nWe collect two types of information regarding our Visitors and Users:\n\n\nUn-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a Visitor or un-identified User, which may be made available to us, or collected automatically via his/her use of the Services (\u201cNon-personal Information\u201d). Such Non-personal Information does not enable us to identify the Visitor or User from whom it was collected. The Non-personal Information collected by us mainly consists of technical and aggregated usage information, such as Visitors\u2019 and Users\u2019 browsing and \u2018click-stream\u2019 activity on the Services, session heatmaps and scrolls, non-identifying information regarding the Visitor\u2019s or User\u2019s device, operating system, internet browser, screen resolution, language and keyboard settings, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, date/time stamps, etc.\n\n\nIndividually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable efforts cause the identification of an individual, or may be of private or sensitive nature (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d).

That\u2019s why tribefii\u00a0is taking steps\u00a0to enable you to access, update, amend, or limit the use of your Personal Information.\n\u200b\u200bAs a tribefii User, you may access, correct, or update your Personal Information\u00a0through \u201cMy Profile\u201d in your tribefii account. Your Users-of-Users\u2019 Personal Information may be accessed only by you through your tribefii Account.\u00a0\n        We may retain your Personal Information (as well as your Users-of-Users\u2019 Information) for as long as your User Account is active, as indicated in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise needed to provide you with our Services.\nWe may continue to retain such Personal Information even after you deactivate your User Account and/or cease to use any particular Services, as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes regarding our Users or their Users-of-Users, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our agreements and/or protect our legitimate interests.\nWe maintain a data retention policy which we apply to information in our care. Where your Personal Information is no longer required we will ensure it is securely deleted.tribefii\u00a0has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural measures. Among other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to most areas on our Services; the transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit card number) through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection. We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our Services and protection of our Visitors\u2019 and Users\u2019 privacy.\nRegardless of the measures and efforts taken by tribefii, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your Personal Information, your Users-of-Users\u2019 Information or any other User Content you upload, publish or otherwise share with tribefii\u00a0or anyone else.\nWe therefore encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account and User Website, and avoid providing us or anyone with any sensitive information of which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm. Furthermore, because certain areas on our Services are less secure than others (for example, if you set your Support forum ticket to be \u201cPublic\u201d instead of \u201cPrivate\u201d, or if you browse to a non-SSL page), and since e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any Personal Information on any of these areas or via any of these methods.\nIf you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are welcome to contact us at\u00a0privacy@tribefii.com.\n            \n        13 PUBLIC FORUMS AND USER CONTENT\n    \n            Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs, communities and support forums. Please be aware that any information you provide in any such areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blogs, communities or forums, feel free to contact us at:\u00a0privacy@tribefii.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information from such areas. For example, if you use a third party application to post a comment (e.g., the Facebook social plugin application) while logged in to your related profile with such third party, you must login into such application or contact its provider if you want to remove\u00a0the Personal Information you posted on that platform.\nIn any event, we advise against posting any information (or use any posting means to post information) you don\u2019t wish to publicize\u00a0on these\u00a0platforms.\nIf you upload any User Content to your User Account or post it on your User Website and provide it in any other way as part of the use of any Service, you do so at your own risk.\nWe have put adequate security measures in place to protect your Personal Information. \u00a0However, we cannot control the actions of other Users or members of the public who may access your User Content, and are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures you or we may have placed on your User Website (including, for instance, password-protected areas on your User Website). You understand and acknowledge that, even after its removal by you or us, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if any third parties (including any of your Users-of-Users) have copied or stored such User Content.\u00a0To clarify, we advise against\u00a0uploading or posting any information you do\u00a0not wish to be\u00a0public.\n        \n            \n        14 UPDATES AND INTERPRETATION\n    \n            We may update this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law, and to reflect changes to our information collection, usage and storage practices. If we make any changes that we deem as \u201cmaterial\u201d (in our sole good faith discretion), we will notify you (using one of the notification methods set forth in\u00a0the\u00a0Terms of Use) prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.\nUnless\u00a0stated otherwise, our most current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your Users-of-Users, with respect to our Website, and other tribefii\u00a0Services.\nThis Privacy Policy was written in English, and may be translated into other languages for your convenience. You may access and view other language versions by changing your tribefii\u00a0Website\u00a0 or browser language settings (where available). If a translated (non-English) version of this Privacy Policy conflicts in any way with its English version, the provisions of the English version shall prevail.\n        \n                    \n                \n        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise any of your rights as described in Section 11, please contact us the Data Protection Officer team at\u00a0privacy@tribefii.com. We will attempt to resolve any complaints regarding the use of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n    \n        Effective Date: [26 Oct 2018]\n                                                                                                                                                                                ", "length": 29550, "excerpt": "Welcome to tribefii\u2019s Privacy Policy!", "siteName": null, "applied": false}
