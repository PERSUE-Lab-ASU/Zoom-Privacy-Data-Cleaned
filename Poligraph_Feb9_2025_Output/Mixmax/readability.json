categories of sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">You</li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">When you provide such information directly to us.</li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. When you create a new account to use the Services we will solicit your consent to connect your Google or Microsoft account to your new Mixmax account (using Google\u2019s or Microsoft\u2019s OAuth authentication method), thereby providing us with access to your Google or Microsoft account, including but not limited to email, Contacts, and Calendar. Although the OAuth authentication provides broad access to your Google or Microsoft account, Mixmax accesses and stores a subset of data from your Google or Microsoft account, including name, email address, calendar content, contacts, and company domain directory, to provide you with our Services. During email composition, we temporarily store the content of your draft email message (however once the message is sent, draft content is transferred to your Gmail or Outlook account and stored on Google\u2019s or Microsoft\u2019s servers, not Mixmax\u2019s). Mixmax stores the email body in the following contexts: when you create an email draft and the message remains unsent; when you create a Sequence or Template in Mixmax; when you share an email via a share link; and when you enable people in your organization to view your messages in the Live Feed.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">You can limit the amount of Personal Information transferred to us by being sure to complete and send your draft email messages, or by deleting any unsent drafts if you decide not to send them, or by refraining from using the features listed above in which we store the email body, or other features in which we notify you that we store the email body. In addition, when you send email using the Services we collect the recipient\u2019s name, email address and the email subject line so that we can display that information in your Live Feed in Mixmax and for debugging purposes. If you are using open, click, and download tracking, Mixmax collects the recipient\u2019s device type and IP address (in order to provide you with the recipient\u2019s approximate location when the message is opened), along with the recipient\u2019s activities (for example: opens, clicks, downloads). For recipients outside the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), Mixmax uses these activities data to provide Recommended Send Times, which indicate the times of day when the recipient has been active with Mixmax emails in the past. Mixmax does not provide Recommended Send Times for recipients within the EU.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">In keeping with standard online privacy practices, users should not include any highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, financial information, or \u201cprotected health information\u201d (as that term is defined by the Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act)) in any emails so that such data does not transfer to our servers (even if only temporarily). For the use of our Services in a HIPAA compliant environment, please see \u201cIndustry-based Compliance\u201d section below.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">In addition, we collect Personal Information you submit to us, for example by completing a form on www.mixmax.com. In that case, we may communicate with you, for example by calling you at the phone number you provide, sending you promotional email offers, or emailing you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps enhance our engagement with you and generally improve our Services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:privacy@mixmax.com\"><span>privacy@mixmax.com</span></a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">When you use the Services and such information is collected automatically.&nbsp;</li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, \u201ccookie\u201d information, the type of browser and/or device you\u2019re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. \u201cCookies\u201d are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.

When you create a new account to use the Services we will solicit your consent to connect your Google or Microsoft account to your new Mixmax account (using Google\u2019s or Microsoft\u2019s OAuth authentication method), thereby providing us with access to your Google or Microsoft account, including but not limited to email, Contacts, and Calendar. Although the OAuth authentication provides broad access to your Google or Microsoft account, Mixmax accesses and stores a subset of data from your Google or Microsoft account, including name, email address, calendar content, contacts, and company domain directory, to provide you with our Services. During email composition, we temporarily store the content of your draft email message (however once the message is sent, draft content is transferred to your Gmail or Outlook account and stored on Google\u2019s or Microsoft\u2019s servers, not Mixmax\u2019s). Mixmax stores the email body in the following contexts: when you create an email draft and the message remains unsent; when you create a Sequence or Template in Mixmax; when you share an email via a share link; and when you enable people in your organization to view your messages in the Live Feed.\nYou can limit the amount of Personal Information transferred to us by being sure to complete and send your draft email messages, or by deleting any unsent drafts if you decide not to send them, or by refraining from using the features listed above in which we store the email body, or other features in which we notify you that we store the email body. In addition, when you send email using the Services we collect the recipient\u2019s name, email address and the email subject line so that we can display that information in your Live Feed in Mixmax and for debugging purposes. If you are using open, click, and download tracking, Mixmax collects the recipient\u2019s device type and IP address (in order to provide you with the recipient\u2019s approximate location when the message is opened), along with the recipient\u2019s activities (for example: opens, clicks, downloads). For recipients outside the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), Mixmax uses these activities data to provide Recommended Send Times, which indicate the times of day when the recipient has been active with Mixmax emails in the past. Mixmax does not provide Recommended Send Times for recipients within the EU.\nIn keeping with standard online privacy practices, users should not include any highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, financial information, or \u201cprotected health information\u201d (as that term is defined by the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act)) in any emails so that such data does not transfer to our servers (even if only temporarily). For the use of our Services in a HIPAA compliant environment, please see \u201cIndustry-based Compliance\u201d section below.\nIn addition, we collect Personal Information you submit to us, for example by completing a form on www.mixmax.com. In that case, we may communicate with you, for example by calling you at the phone number you provide, sending you promotional email offers, or emailing you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps enhance our engagement with you and generally improve our Services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to privacy@mixmax.com.\n\nWhen you use the Services and such information is collected automatically.\u00a0\n\nWhenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, \u201ccookie\u201d information, the type of browser and/or device you\u2019re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. \u201cCookies\u201d are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.
