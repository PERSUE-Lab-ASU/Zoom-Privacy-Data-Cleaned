                    <p>At Phreesia, we're committed to patient privacy and keeping health information secure.</p>
                    <p>
                        We are fully committed to the privacy and security of our users' data. Our administrative,
                        technical, and physical safeguards are designed to secure and protect protected health
                        information (PHI). Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),
                        Phreesia is defined as a “business associate,” which is an individual or entity that
                        is not a member of the “covered entity's” (i.e., the healthcare provider's)
                        workforce and performs certain functions involving the use or disclosure of protected health
                        information (PHI) on behalf of the covered entity. As a business associate, Phreesia is subject
                        to, and committed to, all applicable HIPAA privacy and security requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Phreesia's Provider clients can configure and direct intake tools on the Phreesia Platform to
                        collect their patients' information. Phreesia may collect other information and request certain
                        permissions from Provider clients to ensure our products and services are functioning and for
                        other permissible purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If an individual signs an optional Authorization to receive additional health-related materials
                        from Phreesia, Phreesia continues to protect the individual's personal data under our
                        <a href="https://privacy.phreesia.net/privacy/privacy-policy.html">Platform Privacy Policy</a>.

                    <p>Phreesia's privacy and security procedures include the following safeguards:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            PHI is secured through password protection and can only be accessed by authorized users
                            within the healthcare practice.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            PHI is firewall-protected and under electronic surveillance 24 hours a day, seven days a
                            week.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            PHI is never stored on PhreesiaPads or Arrivals kiosks, so if either device is lost or
                            stolen, no PHI will be compromised.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            PHI transmitted between the Phreesia platform and Phreesia's data centers is protected using
                            industry-standard TLS (256-bit AES keys).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            PhreesiaPads and Arrivals kiosks are configured from the factory to use WPA2 encryption and
                            the AES algorithm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Patient data is stored in a highly-secured data center, protected by multi-layer protocols.
                            This means:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The servers that house the data are stored in a secured building with multiple
                                    layers of physical security.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    At the network level, these servers are placed in a secure subnet protected by
                                    firewalls.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Front-end servers and database servers are on physically different networks and have
                                    limited connectivity.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The security of all server networks is monitored by an intrusion detection system
                                    that is staffed 24/7 by trained security professionals.
                                </li>
                                <li>Within the database server, data is stored in an encrypted form.</li>
                                <li>Patient data is stored using AES encryption with a key size of 256 bits.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
