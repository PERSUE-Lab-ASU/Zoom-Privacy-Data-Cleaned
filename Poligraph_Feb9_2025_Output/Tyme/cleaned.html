                    <h4>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights.</h4>
                    <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by reaching out to <a href="mailto:help@tymeapp.co">help@tymeapp.co </a><br>Only you may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">The request must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide sufficiently detailed information to allow BEONTYME TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED to reasonably verify that you are the person to whom the requested Personal Information pertains or their authorized representative.</li>
                        <li>Include sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
                        <li>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.</li>
                        <li>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</li>
                        <li>BEONTYME TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Response Timing and Format.</h4>
                    <p>We will attempt to respond to Indian Resident requests in as timely a fashion as possible. In the event of delays over 60 days, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable receipt of a Indian Resident’s request. The response we provide will explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. <br>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before fulfilling your request.</p>

                    <h4>BUSINESS TRANSFERS</h4>

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer of Beontyme Technologies Private Limited may continue to use your Personal Information as outlined in this Privacy Notice.</p>
