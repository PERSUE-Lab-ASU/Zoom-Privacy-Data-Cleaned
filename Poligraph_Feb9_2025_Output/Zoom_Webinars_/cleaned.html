Canadian Privacy Rights</strong></p><p>If you are located in Canada, the <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> and applicable provincial privacy legislation (collectively, “<strong>Canadian Privacy Laws</strong>”) govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by organizations in the course of commercial activities. If you are located in Canada, this Canadian Privacy Rights section applies to you. Additionally, in certain Canadian provinces, provincial privacy legislation will apply to you, namely, for the Province of Alberta – the <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em> (Alberta), for the Province of British Columbia – the <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em> (British Columbia) and for the Province of Quebec – the <em>Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector</em> also applies to you and the expression “Canadian Privacy Laws” therefore also includes reference to these provincial laws.
