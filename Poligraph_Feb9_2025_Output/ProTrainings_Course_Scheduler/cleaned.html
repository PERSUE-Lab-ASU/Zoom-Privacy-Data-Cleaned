<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>Sometimes users of this website must first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest.

<h2>Additionally</h2>

<p>We have have adopted a Data Protection Addendum ("Policy"). This Policy applies to the processing of Personal Data that ProTrainings obtains from Customers located in the European Union and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>We comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from Individual Customers in the European Union member countries.</p>

<p>We have certified that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles as it related to customers located in the European Union and the United Kingdom, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern. To see our Data Protection Addendum please visit: <a href="/data-protection">www.protrainings.com/data-protection</a>. To learn more about the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov">www.dataprivacyframework.gov</a>.</p>

  <h2>Medical &amp; Instructional Source Authority</h2>

  <p>Our training programs adhere to the most up-to-date medical and educational guidelines published by nationally recognized authorities and utilizes the following source authorities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>2020 ECC/ILCOR and American Heart Association Guidelines</li>
    <li>2015 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science with Treatment Recommendations, International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, Resuscitation, Nov./Dec. 2015, Vol. 67, Nos. 2-3.</li>
    <li>JAMA</li>
    <li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation. (EMS Curriculum)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Development of Medical Knowledge:</h2>

  <p>The process of medical knowledge is gained through research and the practice of medicine by licensed physicians, surgeons, paramedics, nurses and other healthcare professionals. Knowledge gained through medical practice and research is evaluated and debated in formal and informal education settings, peer-reviewed medical journals, consensus conferences, seminars, and through other similar processes. Knowledge is investigated both privately and publicly, with regard to effectiveness, safety, ethical character and cost-effectiveness. Knowledge and medical practices that survive the rigors of debate and consensus-building and are met with widespread agreement among experts eventually become generally accepted within the medical community. Those concepts achieving general medical acceptance are typically published in texts and journals to be relied upon by practicing healthcare professionals. Academic universities, vocational schools, and other teaming organizations like ProTrainings develop program content based upon published medical literature and tailor training materials to meet the needs of the target audience.</p>

  <h2>Instructional Program Acceptance</h2>

  <p>ILCOR and the ECC publish national consensus guidelines for CPR and First Aid that reputable educators like such as ourselves follow. However, <u>no single organization regulates or authorizes CPR and First Aid training programs</u>. Naming any single organization in statute or regulation often has the unintended consequence of discouraging enterprising approaches to first aid and CPR training, reducing the number of qualified first aid and CPR training programs available to serve the public. This practice also places government in the position of sanctioning particular programs thus discouraging or eliminating competition. Governments acting in this capacity are put at risk without any supporting public policy rationale.</p>

  <h2>Our Distinctives</h2>

  <p>We are dedicated to providing instructional programs which are participant-centered rather than teacher-centered. Using an instructional approach which differs from routine academic education and our overall strategy for skill development is simplification: regular review, repetition in a relaxed positive environment, self-discovery, cooperative learning, and joint assessment of knowledge and skills are emphasized. Successful completion of our training is based upon reasonable performance of emergency care skills rather than perfection. Flexibility is founded upon the fact that real life emergencies are unexpected and dynamic. Requiring rigidity and 100 percent accuracy in skill performance may contribute unnecessary barriers to taking action. We believe the instructional model provides participants with the tools necessary to act without fear of imperfection. NOTE: Our CPR online re-certification in CPR for Healthcare Providers does not require hands on performance to prove proficiency for continued education and recertification.</p>

  <p>We believe initial first aid training must include manikin practice and skill evaluation. We train facilitators that allow participants to perform manikin practice and have their skills evaluated. Trained facilitators are entered into the registry and issued a revocable certificate authorizing these individuals to conduct skill evaluations for our programs. We are committed to delivering exemplary first aid and CPR training. In furtherance of this goal, the company promotes a standardized instructional system designed in concert with professionals. The program development process draws upon the talent and experience of recognized experts In the field, outside consultants, and diligent medical research to ensure that program content and medical treatment guidelines used in our training programs are safe and meet or exceed current standards and guidelines.</p>

<h2>Amendments</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy and additional information contained herein may be amended from time to time. When we amend this Privacy Policy, we will update this page to state the date that the policy was last modified. You must agree to the amendments as a condition of your continued use of our Site and Service. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease using our Site and Service and notify us of your refusal to agree by phone or e-mail at support@protrainings.com.</p>
