Depending on the situation and the type of data involved, Founderhood may act as a data controller or a data processor.\n                Where you are using our platform and making decisions about the personal data that is being processed on our platform, you are acting as a data controller and Founderhood is acting as data processor.\n                In other cases, Founderhood will be the controller of some personal data (such as contact information for marketing purposes, or when monitoring usage information on our platform).\n                The lawful bases under which Founderhood collects personal data under the GDPR are contractual necessity, legitimate interests and consent, as described in this policy.\n                This policy explains what information we collect when you access our platform, how the information is used, and how you can control the processing, correction and/or deletion of your information.\n\n                1. What data we collect\n                Founderhood collects personal data about you when you provide it directly to us, or when personal data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our platform.

Please do not provide us with any sensitive personal data whilst using the platform.\n                    Log Data: information automatically recorded by the platform about how a person uses our platform, such as IP addresses, device and browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our platform to which a user browsed, the time spent on those pages or features, the frequency with which the platform is used by a user, search terms used by a user, the links on the platform that a user clicked on or used, and other statistics.\n                    Marketing Preference: information we collect to identify or contact you such as your name, email address and marketing preferences.\n                \n\n                2.

We may, for example, aggregate Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature on our platform.\n                If an individual applies for a role with us at Founderhood, we will use the personal information you provide us, during the recruitment process.\n\n                4.
