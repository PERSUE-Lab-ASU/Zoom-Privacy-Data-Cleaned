                <h4>What information we collect and why</h4>
                <p>This policy applies to the site/service/forum ("platform") owned and operated by us, Founderhood by GROUPNOW SINGLEPERSON PC.</p>
                <p>Under GDPR, there is a distinction between a “controller” and “processor” of personal data. Depending on the situation and the type of data involved, Founderhood may act as a data controller or a data processor.</p>
                <p>Where you are using our platform and making decisions about the personal data that is being processed on our platform, you are acting as a data controller and Founderhood is acting as data processor.</p>
                <p>In other cases, Founderhood will be the controller of some personal data (such as contact information for marketing purposes, or when monitoring usage information on our platform).</p>
                <p>The lawful bases under which Founderhood collects personal data under the GDPR are contractual necessity, legitimate interests and consent, as described in this policy.</p>
                <p>This policy explains what information we collect when you access our platform, how the information is used, and how you can control the processing, correction and/or deletion of your information.</p>

                <h4>1. What data we collect</h4>

Web Beacons are embedded in, or otherwise associated with, certain emails or other communications that you may receive from us. Web Beacons help us track your responses and interests and deliver relevant content and services to you. For example, they may let us know when you take actions based on the emails that we send.</p>
                <p><strong>Data received from third parties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you connect other apps to our Services (such as Slack and Google Calendar), we receive data which may include your username, email address, Slack channels and Google Calendars.</li>
                    <li>Data from platforms our Services relies on, such as for transaction information and payment verification.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. How we use data</h4>
                <p>Founderhood uses personal data to: (i) provide, administer, and improve our service; (ii) better understand your needs and interests; (iii) fulfill requests you make (including customer support queries); (iv) personalize your experience; (v) provide service announcements; (vi) protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, or illegal activity and (vii) comply with legal obligations.</p>

                    <li>Learn more about our users and their internet behaviors;</li>
                    <li>Target offers to users;</li>
                    <li>Facilitate communications among and between users and the public in general;</li>
                    <li>Evaluate eligibility of customers for certain offers, products, or services;</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the types of offers, products, or services that may be of interest to users;</li>
                    <li>Communicate with users regarding support, security, technical issues, commerce, marketing, and transactions;</li>

                    <li>Publish aggregated data about usage trends, which may be derived from personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may collect, use, and share statistical data that is derived from personal data, but this is not considered personal data in law as it does not directly or indirectly reveal the identity of an individual. We may, for example, aggregate Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature on our platform.</p>
                <p>If an individual applies for a role with us at Founderhood, we will use the personal information you provide us, during the recruitment process.</p>

                <h4>4. Lawful basis for processing data</h4>
                <p>We will only use your personal data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity, and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.</p>

                <h4>6. Accessing, correcting and deleting your data</h4>
                <p>You have the right to request a copy of some or all of your personal data — please email support@thefounderhood.com to do so. We also want to make sure that your personal data is accurate and up-to-date, so please email us if you would like to amend or delete it.</p>
                <p><strong>No fee is usually required</strong></p>
                <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
                <p><strong>What we may need from you</strong></p>
                <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
                <p><strong>Time limit to respond</strong></p>
                <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within two months. Occasionally it may take us longer than two months if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

                <h4>7. International Transfers</h4>
                <p>Where we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</li>
                    <li>Where required, we will use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as afforded under EEA data protection legislation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>8. How long we keep your data</h4>
                <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint, if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation with respect to our relationship with you, or as required or permitted by applicable law.</p>
                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>

                <h4>9. How and when we disclose your data</h4>
                <p><strong>Disclosure to comply with the law</strong></p>
                <p>We may disclose personal data or other information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.</p>
                <p>We also reserve the right to disclose personal data or other information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the services and any facilities or equipment used to make the service available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights, enforce our contracts, or protect the rights, property, or safety of others.</p>
