Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.\n  Restrict the processing of their Data. Users have the right to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other than storing it.\n\n  Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed. Users have the right to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.\n  Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller. Users have the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.\n  Lodge a complaint.
