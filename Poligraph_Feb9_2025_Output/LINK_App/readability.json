MOBILE HELIX LINK APP AND SYSTEM, \u201cAPPLICATION,\u201d PRIVACY POLICY </strong></p>\n<p>This privacy policy governs the use of the software application, Mobile Helix Link App and System (\u201cApplication\u201d), that was created by Mobile Helix, Inc. (\u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d). This privacy policy explains what and how we collect, use, and disseminate information obtained from or about the employee of the hosting entity as a user of the Application.</p>\n<p>For background, the Application is licensed and managed by hosting entities, such as law firms. The hosting entity installs the Application on servers which are managed by the entity. Mobile Helix does not have access to those servers. The hosting entity distributes the Application to its employees. The Application connects with the hosting entity\u2019s enterprise resources and enables users/employees to access the data, files, and applications which they use for work. The Application is encrypted, remotely wipeable, authenticated using certificates as well as other methods including Single Sign-on. The Application is not licensed to or accessible for use by consumers.</p>\n<p>Mobile Helix does not directly interface with the hosting entity\u2019s employees nor with the hosting entity\u2019s clients. The Application does not report any information about the users of the Application to Mobile Helix. An entity may provide limited information via email or via a support request. Support requests are managed by Mobile Helix in a top-tier, security vetted issue management system.</p>\n<p><strong>Types of Information Collected</strong></p>\n<p><strong>User Provided Information</strong></p>\n<p>When the employee is provisioned to the Application by their employer, they are registered by the employer with their name, email address, user name, password and other registration information. This information is already known to, stored by, and managed by their employer (entity) which is hosting the Application, e.g., the law firm.</p>\n<p>Mobile Helix does have access to, nor collect, nor store this information.</p>\n<p><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Application may employ the employee\u2019s location to find a network gateway for optimal global performance, but the Application does not track the user\u2019s location. The employee\u2019s location is never stored (not even in the Application\u2019s analytics). The hosting entity, e.g., a law firm, may disable the use of the user\u2019s location to find a network gateway.</li>\n<li>Mobile Helix does not have any access in any way to the employee\u2019s location or to the employee\u2019s activity in the Application. The user\u2019s actions inside of the Application are confidential to the hosting entity, e.g., a law firm.</li>\n<li>The Application does collect metadata (analytics) about the user\u2019s activities in the Application so that the hosting entity may use that metadata to determine how the Application is being used. This metadata only includes the applications that the employee accesses in the Application and the activities that the employee executes (e.g., to compose an email or to open a file) in the Application. The Application never tracks, stores, processes, monitors, etc., any of the actual data contained in, for example, an email or a file, that the employee views in the Application. In any case, this metadata is not accessible to Mobile Helix unless the entity grants one-time access to this data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When the employee interacts with the Application, the Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of device used, the device\u2019s unique device ID, the IP address of the device, and the operating system. As in point number two above, Mobile Helix does not have access in any way to this data. This data is confidential to the hosting organization or firm.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>\n<p>Mobile Helix cannot access User Provided Information and Automatically Collected Information. It is only accessible by the hosting entity, e.g., a law firm.</p>\n<p>Mobile Helix does not use such information.</p>\n<p><strong>Sharing of Information</strong></p>\n<p>Mobile Helix cannot access User Provided Information and Automatically Collected Information. It is only accessible by the hosting entity, e.g., a law firm.</p>\n<p>Mobile Helix does not share such information.</p>\n<p><strong>California Residents</strong></p>\n<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (the \u201cShine the Light\u201d law), California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services from us are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2015 will receive information regarding 2014 sharing activities).
