If we are processing your Personal Data as a service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance &nbsp;to address your rights with respect to such data.</p><p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at support@affinity.co.</p><p><em>Access</em></p><p>You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:</p><ul role="list"><li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li><li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.</li><li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.</li><li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.</li><li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li></ul><p>If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data sold to each category of third party recipient.</p><p><em>Deletion</em></p><p>You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request. </p><p><em>Exercising Your Rights</em></p><p>To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p><p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p><p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p><ul role="list"><li>Email us at: support@affinity.co</li></ul><p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p><p><em>Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In</em></p><p>In this section, we use the term ‘sell’ as it is defined in the CCPA in relation to our Services. We do not sell your Personal Data uploaded or provided by you in your use of the Services. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed certain categories of Personal Data (i.e. Web Analytics) described in the section <em>Categories of Personal Data We Collect</em> to third-party advertising partners, such as in connection with our use of tracking technologies for cross-context behavioral advertising, so that we can reach you with advertisements for our products and services. This may be considered “sharing” or a “sale” under the CCPA.</p><p>As required by the CCPA, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Data. You can opt-out using the following methods:</p><ul role="list"><li>Email us at support@affinity.co</li></ul><p>To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age. </p><p><em>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</em></p><p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.</p><div class="w-embed"><div style="top: -100px; position: relative;" id="other-state"></div></div><p><strong>Other State Law Privacy Rights</strong></p><p><em>California Resident Rights</em></p><p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at support@affinity.co.</p><p><em>Nevada Resident Rights</em></p><p>If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Data to third parties who intend to license or sell that Personal Data.

(“Affinity”) complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (“UK-U.S. DPF”), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) (collectively, the “DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. &nbsp;Affinity has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of all personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. &nbsp;Affinity has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF (the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and applicable principles under the UKU.S. DPF, collectively, the “DPF Principles”). &nbsp;If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. &nbsp;To learn more about the DPF, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.</a></p><p>The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Affinity’s compliance with the DPF. This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, the purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Data, and the purposes for which we disclose your Personal Data to certain types of third parties in the sections above. &nbsp;Pursuant to the DPF, EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain Personal Data relating to you in the U.S. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the Personal Data that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the Personal Data we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the U.S. under DPF, should direct their query to Privacy@affinity.co. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. For more information about rights afforded to you, please see the EU/UK Section of the Privacy Policy. </p><p>In addition, we will provide you with the choice to opt-out from the sharing of your Personal Data with any third parties (other than our agents or those that act on our behalf or under our instruction), or before we use it for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. </p><p>In addition to any other disclosures described in our Privacy Policy, in certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. </p><p>Affinity’s accountability for Personal Data that it receives in the U.S. under the DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf is described in the DPF Principles. In particular, Affinity remains liable under the DPF Principles if our agents process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Affinity proves that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p><p>In compliance with the DPF, Affinity commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your Personal Data. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPF should first contact Affinity at <a href="mailto:privacy@affinity.co">privacy@affinity.co</a>.</p><p>In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Affinity commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to the American Arbitration Association, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. &nbsp;If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html for more information or to file a complaint. &nbsp;The services of the American Arbitration Association are provided at no cost to you.</p><p>If your complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.
