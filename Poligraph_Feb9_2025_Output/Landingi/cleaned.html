<li>Every person browsing the Site, Platform or any Landing Page should manage cookies by modifying the settings of their web browser. If you do not want to use them, you can prevent the storage of cookies on your device or delete the stored files permanently. Please be informed that this may, however, lead to deterioration of the quality of service provided by not collecting cookies or reading information on their basis.</li>
