Privacy policies can be messy and complicated.

The controller is responsible for writing an organization\u2019s privacy policy, which details what data that organization collects, how it uses the data, and where it sends the data.</p>\n<p>The Cirrus Insight <strong>Services</strong> include our <a href=\"https://www.cirrusinsight.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.cirrusinsight.com</a> website, product trials, and our free and paid applications.

Privacy policies can be messy and complicated. But at Cirrus Insight, your privacy is important to us. \u00a0On this page, we have tried to unscramble the legal jargon and provide one comprehensive spot to provide understandable information about our privacy practices.\nOur Privacy Policy addresses five main topics:\u00a0\n\nThe Information We Collect\nHow We Use the Information We Collect\u00a0\nThe Ways We Share Your Information\nHow We Protect Your Information\nYour Rights Related to the Information We Collect\n\nWe pride ourselves on  Services, and recognize that in order to provide them, we need you to agree to our policy! We use Cirrus Insight ourselves, and we believe in treating our customers as we would wish to be treated. With that in mind we have developed this Privacy Policy to be as transparent as possible and to provide you with the tools needed to a) fully understand our policy, b) fully understand how our policy affects you, and c) make meaningful choices about how your (and their) information is used.\n\nImportant Terms\nThere are some important terms used throughout this Privacy Policy. It is important to understand these terms and how they apply to Cirrus Insight.\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) is a set of data that can be used to distinguish or identify a specific individual.\nA Data Processor is an individual or organization that provides data systems and services on behalf of and as instructed by a third party for a limited, specific purpose.\nA Data Controller is an individual or organization that manages how data is processed and is responsible for complying with data protection regulations. The controller is responsible for writing an organization\u2019s privacy policy, which details what data that organization collects, how it uses the data, and where it sends the data.\nThe Cirrus Insight Services include our www.cirrusinsight.com website, product trials, and our free and paid applications. You can find more information about our Services on our Products page.\nCirrus Insight as a Data Processor\nCirrus Insight acts as a Data Processor for its Clients using the Cirrus Insight Services and only processes and retains PII based on contractual specifications and customized settings selected by the Client. All PII maintained by Cirrus Insight on behalf of  Clients is fully encrypted.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this case, the Client controls your information as the data controller, not Cirrus Insight.\u00a0 You will need to refer to the Client\u2019s privacy policy and contact them for inquiries regarding your Personal Information.\u00a0 Cirrus Insight only follows the instructions of the Client in regard to data retention and deletion.\u00a0\nIn providing the Services, Cirrus Insight may have access to this data when providing live technical support.\u00a0\nCirrus Insight as the Data Controller\nCirrus Insight acts as a\u00a0Data Controller when you have direct input information into a form on Cirrus Insight\u2019s website or you directly provide PII through Cirrus Insight's Client administration (billing, contact information) and/or customer services portals.\nWhat Does This Privacy Policy Apply To?\nBy using the Website, Apps or any of the Services, and in particular by registering a Cirrus Insight account, you are consenting to the use of your information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all PII that Cirrus Insight collects when it serves as a Data Processor.

For a period of 90 days after any update, we will include a notice on the homepage of\u00a0www.cirrusinsight.com.\nCirrus Insight encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
