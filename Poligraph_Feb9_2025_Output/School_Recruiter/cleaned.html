<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Entering into and performing a contract with you:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to provide our Recruitment Services, we may enter into a contract with you and/or a third party. In order to enter into a contract, we will need certain information, for example your name and address. A contract will also contain obligations on both your part and our part, and we shall process your data as is necessary for the purpose of those obligations. For example, in order to process payroll, a national insurance number and bank details will be required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Compliance with legal obligations (regulatory and statutory obligations):</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must comply with a number of statutory provisions when providing our Recruitment Services, which necessitate the processing of personal data. These include the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003, which amongst other things requires us to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify your identity</li>
<li>Assess your suitability for an external job role</li>
<li>Maintain records for specific periods</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we engage a person to work for us (whether directly or as supplied to a Client), there are other statutory obligations that must be complied with including payroll, tax, social security, HMRC reporting requirements, and any other law or regulation. We are also required to comply with statutory and regulatory obligations relating to business generally, for example complying with tax, bribery, fraud/crime prevention and data protection legislation, and co-operating with regulatory authorities such as HMRC or the Information Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Our legitimate interests (carrying on the commercial activity of Recruitment Services):</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In providing our Recruitment Services, we will carry out some processing of personal data which is necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interests, which include: Retaining records of our dealings and transactions and where applicable, use such records for the purposes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>establishing compliance with contractual obligations with Clients or suppliers</li>
<li>addressing any query or dispute that may arise including establishing, exercising or defending any legal claims</li>
<li>protecting our reputation</li>
<li>maintaining a backup of our system, solely for the purpose of being able to restore the system to a particular point in the event of a system failure or security breach</li>

<li>determining staff training and system requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

In other cases, you may have provided your written or verbal consent to the use of your data for a specific reason. You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information for a particular purpose at any stage. However, please note that we may continue to retain, or otherwise use your personal information thereafter where we have a legitimate interest or a legal or contractual obligation to do so. Our processing in that respect will be limited to what is necessary in furtherance of those interests or obligations. Withdrawal of consent will not have any effect on the lawfulness of any processing based on consent before its withdrawal.<br> What if we obtain your personal data from a third party?<br> Part of our business activity involves researching information relating to individuals for the purposes of filling job roles. This may include obtaining personal data from online sources, for example we may obtain information from social media sites such as LinkedIn and job boards, some information being publicly available but others being from sites or providers to which we subscribe.

Where information from third party sources is of no use to us, or where you have notified us that you do not want us to provide you with services, we shall discard it, however we may maintain a limited record in order to avoid the duplication of process. Where we consider that information may be of use to us in pursuance of the provision of our Recruitment Services, any processing will be in accordance with this Privacy Notice. You do have the right to object to processing, please see Section 4 'Your rights'.<br> Sensitive Personal Data (SPD)<br> Sensitive personal data is information which is intensely personal to you and is usually irrelevant to our consideration of your suitability for a job role.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Section 3: This section applies to all personal data</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transfer of data to other jurisdictions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the course of the provision of our Recruitment Services we may transfer data to countries or international organisations outside of the EEA. This may, for example, be to Clients or Candidates, or third parties who provide support services to us. Where information is to be so transferred, it may be to a country in respect of which there is an adequacy decision from the EU Commission. However, if this is not the case, it is our policy to take steps to identify risks and in so far as is reasonably practicable, ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place. This would only apply when individuals are applying for roles in overseas international schools and is done at the request of the candidate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not wish to provide us with necessary data</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be circumstances where we require you to provide data which is necessary in order for us to meet statutory or contractual obligations or perform our Recruitment Services. If you do not wish to provide us with information, we request then please notify us. However, please be aware that as a result we may be unable to provide you or the party who you represent with a Recruitment Service, and in some cases may result in a breach of the contract we have with you or a third party you represent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group companies transfer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although this Privacy Notice applies to us your data may be accessible to, and shared with other organisations within our branch offices and our subsidiary companies of Eteach Group for any of the purposes set out within this Privacy Notice, or where we have shared administration systems and staff.</p>
<p>In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or the transfer of all or part of our assets to a third party, we may need to transfer your information to a third party. Any transfer will be subject to the agreement of the third party to this Privacy Notice and any processing being only in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data Security and Confidentiality</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is our policy to ensure, in so far as is reasonably practicable, that our systems and records are secure and not accessible to unauthorised third parties in line with contemporary practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that is downloaded on to your computer when you visit a website, which enables the website to tailor its offerings to your preferences when you visit it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retaining your data</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most circumstances your data will not be retained for more than 6 years from the last point at which we provided any services or otherwise engaged with you and it is our policy to only store your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations and for our legitimate business interests. However, we may retain data for longer than a 6 year period where we have a legal or contractual obligation to do so, or we form the view that there is otherwise a continued basis to do so, for example where your personal information identifies specialist skill sets which may remain in demand, or we are subject to a legal obligation which applies for a longer period.</p>
<p>If, however you believe that we should delete your personal data at an earlier date, please inform us in writing of your reasons. Please see Section 4 'Your Rights' below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to this Privacy Notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice is regularly reviewed and may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our business, or legal or commercial practice. Where an update is relevant to our processing of your data, we shall notify you of the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Section 4: Your rights</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
