When you simply browse our public website as a consumer\n          (\"<strong>Consumer</strong>\") to explore our Services or to learn more about us, we do not request that you\n          provide us your information. If you use our Services and become a CAKE.com business user who has licensed\n          and/or purchased one of our products or Services or contact us to learn more about using our Services in\n          connection with your business (\"<strong>Business User</strong>\"), we collect information from you as describe\n          below. Our Services, even if free, are offered to Business Users and are only intended for commercial, not\n          personal, use. Our Business Users may also collect and provide us information about their authorized users to\n          whom they provide access to the Clockify, Pumble, or Plaky Services through their Business User account\n          (<strong>\u201cAuthorized User\u201d</strong>) or their clients or customers (<strong>\u201cBusiness Clients\u201d</strong>).\n          Below, we describe the ways in which we may collect information in these different situations.</p>\n        <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>\n        <p>We collect information you provide directly to us.</p>\n        <h4>Business Users</h4>\n        <p>If you are a Business User, we collect certain personal information about you in order to facilitate our\n          business relationship with you and provide you with our products and services.</p>\n        <p>The Business User personal information we collect from you includes:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, account username and password, communications you provide, and\n            any other information you choose to provide.</li>\n          <li><strong>Professional information</strong>: work contact details, title, employer and job title.</li>\n          <li><strong>Commercial information</strong>: purchase or subscription history and type, invoices, payment\n            details where applicable</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>We may also collect information a Business User chooses to provide relating to its Business Clients. Business\n          Users must provide their Business Clients any required notices and collect any necessary consents before\n          providing or disclosing any such information to us. CAKE.com does not directly collect or control Business\n          Client personal information, but rather the Business Users determine what Business Client personal information\n          they collect, and to the extent CAKE.com receives that information, we do so on behalf of our Business Users.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Authorized Users</h4>\n        <p>We collect information from Authorized Users of our Business Users.

However, while we may directly collect your personal\n          information, we do so on behalf of your company, the Business User who provided you access to our Services,\n          and not for our own purposes. CAKE.com does not directly control the processing of Authorized User personal\n          information, but rather Business Users are responsible for providing their Authorized Users any required\n          notices and collecting any necessary consents before requesting that we collect or disclose the personal\n          information of their Authorized Users.</p>\n        <p>The types of Authorized User personal information that we collect for Business Users depends on the Services\n          selected, and directions and permissions given to us by the Business User, but could generally include:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Account information:</strong> your name, account username, user identification, and password,\n            email, language, time zone, phone number, photograph, birthday, anniversary, personal API key, role on our\n            Services, Skype number, chat correspondence on our Services, any communications you provide, and any other\n            information you choose to provide.</li>\n          <li><strong>Professional information</strong>: work contact details, title, employer, job title.</li>\n          <li><strong>Clockify entries</strong>: event and project calendars, time entries, hourly rates, clients and\n            projects, tasks and work assignments, expenses, time off requests, custom fields, screenshots, audit log,\n            and any other information you wish to input.</li>\n          <li><strong>Pumble entries</strong>: messages, files, user status.</li>\n          <li><strong>Plaky entries</strong>: project groups and teams, tasks and their designated team members,\n            comments, invitees, and files.</li>\n          <li><strong>Auto Tracker tool information (Clockify only)</strong>: the applications, programs, and websites\n            you access, and the time (both active and idle) that you spent on each.

This feature enables the\n            Business User to track who is currently working on-site and its Authorized User\u2019s location history\n            throughout the day while the timer is running. Location is recorded every time the timer is started and\n            stopped in the mobile application. Locations are collected even if the mobile application works in the\n            background. You may stop the collection of precise location information at any time (see the Your Choices\n            section below for details).

If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the\n          date at the top of this policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a\n          statement to our website or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy\n          regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.\n        COLLECTION OF INFORMATION\n        The information we collect from you varies depending on our relationship with you, which Services you use,\n          and the way in which you use them. When you simply browse our public website as a consumer\n          (\"Consumer\") to explore our Services or to learn more about us, we do not request that you\n          provide us your information. If you use our Services and become a CAKE.com business user who has licensed\n          and/or purchased one of our products or Services or contact us to learn more about using our Services in\n          connection with your business (\"Business User\"), we collect information from you as describe\n          below. Our Services, even if free, are offered to Business Users and are only intended for commercial, not\n          personal, use. Our Business Users may also collect and provide us information about their authorized users to\n          whom they provide access to the Clockify, Pumble, or Plaky Services through their Business User account\n          (\u201cAuthorized User\u201d) or their clients or customers (\u201cBusiness Clients\u201d).\n          Below, we describe the ways in which we may collect information in these different situations.\n        Information You Provide to Us\n        We collect information you provide directly to us.\n        Business Users\n        If you are a Business User, we collect certain personal information about you in order to facilitate our\n          business relationship with you and provide you with our products and services.\n        The Business User personal information we collect from you includes:\n        \n          Account information: name, account username and password, communications you provide, and\n            any other information you choose to provide.\n          Professional information: work contact details, title, employer and job title.\n          Commercial information: purchase or subscription history and type, invoices, payment\n            details where applicable\n        \n        We may also collect information a Business User chooses to provide relating to its Business Clients. Business\n          Users must provide their Business Clients any required notices and collect any necessary consents before\n          providing or disclosing any such information to us. CAKE.com does not directly collect or control Business\n          Client personal information, but rather the Business Users determine what Business Client personal information\n          they collect, and to the extent CAKE.com receives that information, we do so on behalf of our Business Users.\n        \n        Authorized Users\n        We collect information from Authorized Users of our Business Users. As an Authorized User, you share\n          information directly with us when you create an account, use our Services, submit or post content through our\n          Services, sign up for our newsletter, fill out a form, communicate with us via third-party platforms, request\n          customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. However, while we may directly collect your personal\n          information, we do so on behalf of your company, the Business User who provided you access to our Services,\n          and not for our own purposes. CAKE.com does not directly control the processing of Authorized User personal\n          information, but rather Business Users are responsible for providing their Authorized Users any required\n          notices and collecting any necessary consents before requesting that we collect or disclose the personal\n          information of their Authorized Users.\n        The types of Authorized User personal information that we collect for Business Users depends on the Services\n          selected, and directions and permissions given to us by the Business User, but could generally include:\n        \n          Account information: your name, account username, user identification, and password,\n            email, language, time zone, phone number, photograph, birthday, anniversary, personal API key, role on our\n            Services, Skype number, chat correspondence on our Services, any communications you provide, and any other\n            information you choose to provide.\n          Professional information: work contact details, title, employer, job title.\n          Clockify entries: event and project calendars, time entries, hourly rates, clients and\n            projects, tasks and work assignments, expenses, time off requests, custom fields, screenshots, audit log,\n            and any other information you wish to input.\n          Pumble entries: messages, files, user status.\n          Plaky entries: project groups and teams, tasks and their designated team members,\n            comments, invitees, and files.\n          Auto Tracker tool information (Clockify only): the applications, programs, and websites\n            you access, and the time (both active and idle) that you spent on each. All data collected from the Auto\n            Tracker will be stored on the Authorized User\u2019s device for a limited time unless the such data is converted\n            to a Clockify time entry. (See more information about the Auto Tracker tool here).\n          Integration Tracker tool information (Clockify only): when downloaded into a particular\n            application, program or website, select content from such applicable application, program, or website and\n            the time (both active and idle) that you spent on each.

Authorized Users will receive a notification\n            when screenshot capturing is enabled. (See more information about the Desktop Screenshot tool here).\n          Location Tracker tool information (Clockify only): in accordance with your device\n            permissions, we may collect information about the precise location of your device. This feature enables the\n            Business User to track who is currently working on-site and its Authorized User\u2019s location history\n            throughout the day while the timer is running. Location is recorded every time the timer is started and\n            stopped in the mobile application. Locations are collected even if the mobile application works in the\n            background. You may stop the collection of precise location information at any time (see the Your Choices\n            section below for details). (See more information about the Location Tracker tool here).\n          Add-on interactions: Interactions you have while searching for, installing, disabling and\n            uninstalling the marketplace add-on.\n        \n        Not providing certain personal information may prevent CAKE.com from providing Services to you (e.g., without\n          your email, we may not be able to create an account for you).\n        Information We Collect Automatically When You Interact with Us\n        When you access or use our Services or otherwise transact business with us, we automatically collect certain\n          information, including:\n        \n          Device and usage information: We collect information about how you access our Services,\n            including data about the device and network you use, such as your hardware model, operating system version,\n            mobile network, IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, device time zone, and app version. We\n            also collect information about your activity on our Services, such as access times, pages viewed, links\n            clicked, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.\n          General location information: In accordance with your device permissions, we may collect\n            information about the general location of your device. You may stop the collection of general location\n            information at any time (see the Your Choices section below for details).\n          Information collected by cookies and similar tracking technologies: We (and our service\n            providers) use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you.\n            Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services\n            and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits.
