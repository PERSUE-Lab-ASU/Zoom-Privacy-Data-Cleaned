                        <h2>On what legal basis we have your information</h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">We will only ever process your personal data where we have a lawful basis to do so. We have expanded upon the reasons for us processing your personal data below.</span></p>
<p><strong>1. Where an organisation you work for uses one of our solutions</strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">If you use our solutions through your employer, for example, our HR, Payroll, or eLearning solutions, then we will process your personal data as a&nbsp;</span><strong><span lang="EN-GB">processor</span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></strong><span lang="EN-GB">(your employer is the controller).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">We recommend you read your employer’s relevant privacy documentation for information explaining what personal data is collected, and what for, etc.,</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Third parties may also process your personal data (on our behalf). The details of these third parties will be included in the contract we hold with the controller (your employer).</span></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-GB">See section “Further processing of your personal data” for what data we may process about you in our capacity as an independent controller. </span></em></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">2. Where you have engaged with an organisation that uses one or more of our solutions </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">If you use our solutions via a third-party organisation; for example, to submit your CV to a recruitment agency, or to donate money on a charity’s website, then we will process your personal data as a&nbsp;<strong>processor&nbsp;</strong>(the relevant third-party organisation is the controller).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">We recommend you read the third-party organisation’s relevant privacy documentation for information explaining what personal data is collected, and what for, etc.,</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Some of our solutions have dedicated privacy notices, where this is the case, these are accessible via our&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB"><a rel="noopener" href="https://accessgroup.my.site.com/Support/s/login/?ec=302&amp;startURL=%2FSupport%2Fs%2Fgdpr-hub?ec=302&amp;startURL=%2FSupport%2Fs%2Fgdpr-hub" target="_blank" data-anchor="?ec=302&amp;startURL=%2FSupport%2Fs%2Fgdpr-hub">Security Portal</a></span> or alternatively, they may be accessible within the solution itself.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Third parties may also process your personal data (on our behalf). The details of these third parties will be included in the contract that we hold with the controller.</span></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-GB">See section “Further processing of your personal data” for what data we may process about you in our capacity as an independent controller. </span></em></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">3. Where you have used one of our solutions where we process your data in our capacity as data controller</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">We provide a limited number of solutions where some or all your personal data is processed by the Access Group in its capacity as an independent <strong>controller</strong>. For example, DesignMyNight, sPROC, Adam Procure, Adam Housing and Class4Kids. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Where you use one or more of our Access Products and we process all your data in our capacity as controller, the relevant Access Product will make its own dedicated privacy notice available to you, <strong>save for where the exception below applies</strong>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB">Where you are a “Provider” on SProc, Adam Procure or Adam Housing - a “Provider” meaning a user who has signed up to either SProc, Adam Procure and or Adam Housing to bid on opportunities, contract management and or payment purposes. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The lawful basis for collecting and sharing your information with Access Group customers who have procured services from you as a Provider is <strong>contractual</strong>, as the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract with you. Where the Access Group customer processes your information outside of the relevant solution, they are doing so as an independent controller of your information. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">There we use your information to market Access Group solutions which may be of interest to you, our lawful basis is <strong>legitimate interests</strong>.
