entrusting Pipedream. Holding onto your private information is a serious responsibility, and we want you to know how we’re handling it. We provide this Privacy Statement to those that we work with, provide service to, and those that visit our website, to provide information about the information we collect, how we collect and use it, and how we comply with privacy and legal standards that may apply to us.</p><h2>1. The short version</h2><p>In providing Pipedream’s services, including those described on this website (collectively and individually, our “Services”) We collect the information that our customers and those that interact with us provide to us. We process that information on behalf of our customers – as a “service provider” (under California law) or a “processor” (under the GDPR). Sometimes, we collect other information that we use in our own corporate capacity, such as to send communications to our customers (or prospective customers and users of our Service), or to improve internal aspects of our Services, e.g., to improve the speed or efficiency of our Services.</p><h2>2. What information Pipedream collects in its corporate capacity, and why</h2><p><strong>a. Information from website browsers</strong></p><p>If you’re&nbsp;<strong>just browsing this website</strong>, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody that visits our website, whether they have an account or not.</p><p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p><p>We may also provide a way for visitors to give us contact information – such as an email address or phone number, billing information, or other information that we use in our corporate capacity, in which case we will use that information as set out in this Privacy Statement, and generally, to operate our business and provide, develop and evaluate our Services.</p><p><strong>b. Why we collect this information</strong></p><p>We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use Pipedream, and to monitor and protect the security of the website. If you provide us contact information, we may use it to communicate with you.</p><p><strong>c. Information from users with accounts</strong></p><p>If you&nbsp;<strong>create an account</strong>, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own username, and will be required to sign in with a third-party identity provider tied to a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include “User Personal Information.”</p><p>c. We collect various User Personal Information, as set forth below. “<strong><em>User Personal Information</em></strong>” is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation, which therefore includes online identifiers such as IP addresses, cookie identifiers and user account identifiers, as well as log information such as page views, time stamps and other information connected to how users access our website and access and use our Services). User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personal information, or deidentified information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying or deidentified information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p><p>We collect User Personal Information from you when you use our Services, and we may connect it to log data and other information about how you use our Services. For instance, we may track whether our customers use certain of our Services at certain times, in certain ways, or from certain countries, and we may analyze that information to help us provide better or more efficient Services.

For example, when you fill out an interest survey at account creation, we learn from it — as well as from your public behavior on Pipedream, such as the projects you star — to determine your coding interests, and we recommend similar projects.
