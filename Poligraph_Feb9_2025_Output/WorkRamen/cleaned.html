<h4> Third-Party Provided Content</h4>

<h3> Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information</h3>

<p> Our lawful bases depend on the services you use and how you use them. This is a non-exhaustive list of the lawful bases we use:</p>
<h4> Consent From You</h4>
<p> Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your information that has already taken place. When you contact us, we assume your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to your enquiry.</p>
<p> Where you agree to receive marketing communications from us, we will do so based solely on your indication of consent or until you instruct us not to, which you can do at any time.</p>

<p> Where we assess it is necessary for our legitimate interests, such as for us to provide, operate, improve and communicate our services.

If you have any further enquiries about how we retain personal information in order to comply with the law, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.</p>
<h4> International Transfers of Personal Information</h4>
<p> The personal information we collect is stored and/or processed in the United Kingdom by us. Following an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, the UK has been granted an essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed under UK GDPR.</p>
<p> On some occasions, where we share your data with third parties, they may be based outside of the UK, or the European Economic Area (“EEA”). These countries to which we store, process, or transfer your personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.</p>
<p> If we transfer your personal information to third parties in other countries:</p>
<ul>
<li> we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of the UK GDPR (Article 45) and Data Protection Act 2018;</li>
<li> we will adopt appropriate safeguards for protecting the transferred data, including in transit, such as standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) or binding corporate rules.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Your Data Subject Rights</h4>
<p><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you believe your personal information has been unlawfully processed; (iii) you need us to maintain the personal information solely for the purpose of a legal claim; or (iv) we are in the process of considering your objection in relation to processing on the basis of legitimate interests.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to processing of your personal information that is based on our legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order to proceed with the processing of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Right to be Informed:</strong> You have the right to be informed with how your data is collected, processed, shared and stored.</p>
<p><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you at any time by submitting a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). The statutory deadline for fulfilling a DSAR request is 30 calendar days from our receipt of your request.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> In certain circumstances, you can ask for your personal data to be erased from the records held by organisations. However this is a qualified right; it is not absolute, and may only apply in certain circumstances.</p>
<p> When may the right to erasure apply?</p>
<ul>
<li> When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed for.</li>
<li> If consent was the lawful basis for processing personal data and that consent has been withdrawn. Artwallstreet Pte. Ltd. relies on consent to process personal data in very few circumstances.</li>
<li> The Company is relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis for processing personal data and an individual has exercised the right to object and it has been determined that the Company has no overriding legitimate grounds to refuse that request.</li>
<li> Personal data are being processed for direct marketing purposes e.g. a person’s name and email address, and the individual objects to that processing.</li>
<li> There is legislation that requires that personal data are to be destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Individuals have the right to get some of their personal data from an organisation in a way that is accessible and machine-readable, for example as a csv file. Associated with this, individuals also have the right to ask an organisation to transfer their personal data to another organisation.</p>
<p> However, the right to portability:</p>
<ul>
<li> only applies to personal data which a person has directly given to Artwallstreet Pte. Ltd. in electronic form; and</li>
<li> onward transfer will only be available where this is “technically feasible”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If personal data is inaccurate, out of date, or incomplete, individuals have the right to correct, update or complete that data. Collectively this is referred to as the right to rectification. Rectification may involve filling the gaps i.e. to have to have incomplete personal data completed – although this will depend on the purposes for the processing. This may involve adding a supplementary statement to the incomplete data to highlight any inaccuracy or claim thereof.</p>
<p> This right only applies to an individual’s own personal data; a person cannot seek the rectification of another person’s information.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of data breaches:</strong> Upon discovery of a data breach, we will investigate the incident and report it to the UK’s data protection regulator and yourself, if we deem it appropriate to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Complaints:</strong> You have the right, at any time, to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance using the details below.  Please provide us with as much information as you can about the alleged breach.

When you contact us, we assume your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to your enquiry. Under PIPEDA, consent is only valid if it is reasonable to expect that an individual to whom the organisation's activities are directed would understand the nature, purpose, and consequences of the collection, use, or disclosure of the personal information to which they are consenting.</p>

While we use all reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information receives the same level of security in any other jurisdiction as it would in Canada, please be aware that privacy protections under U.S. laws may not be the same adequacy.</p>
<h4> Customer Data Rights</h4>
<p> Although PIPEDA does not contain an extensive set of consumer rights, it does grant consumers the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Access the personal information organisations hold about them;</li>
<li> Correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information the organisation hold about them (or, if this is not possible, delete the inaccurate personal information)</li>

<p> If any organisational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain about this. We retain the right to decide how we disclose the copies of your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfil your request in 30 days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:</p>
<ul>
<li> meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business activities; or</li>
<li> the time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to the request would make it impractical to meet the time limit.</li>
</ul>
<p> We can also extend the time limit for the length of time required to convert the personal information into an alternative format. In these circumstances, we will advise you of the delay within the first 30 days and explain the reason for it.</p>
<h4> Right of rectification under PIPEDA</h4>
<p> You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within your PII. We would ask you to provide some evidence to back up your claim. Under PIPEDA, an organisation must amend the information, as required, if you successfully demonstrate that it’s incomplete or inaccurate.</p>

<h3> What is a cookie?</h3>
<p> A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit. It typically contains information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser when you return, additional data that serves the cookie’s purpose, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</p>
<p> Cookies are used to enable certain features (e.g. logging in), track site usage (e.g. analytics), store your user settings (e.g. time zone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (e.g. advertising, language).</p>
<p> Cookies set by the website you are visiting are usually referred to as first-party cookies. They typically only track your activity on that particular site.</p>
<p> Cookies set by other sites and companies (i.e. third parties) are called third-party cookies. They can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</p>
<h3> Types of cookies and how we use them</h3>
<h4> Performance cookies</h4>
<p> Performance cookies track how you use a website during your visit. Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated, with information tracked across all site users.

<h4> Targeting/advertising cookies</h4>
<p> Targeting/advertising cookies help determine what promotional content is most relevant and appropriate to you and your interests. Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or limit the number of times you see an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</p>
