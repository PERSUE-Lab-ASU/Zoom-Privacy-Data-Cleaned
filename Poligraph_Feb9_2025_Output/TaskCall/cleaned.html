This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, utilize and disclose your personally identifiable information, also known as personal data or PII, when you use our Software-as-a-Service Information Technology on-call schedule management, alerting, and incident tracking Services, participate in our events or use our Websites or mobile applications that link to this policy. In this Privacy Policy, our Websites, Services, Events, and Apps are collectively referred to as our "Online Services."</p><p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.</p></div><div class="py-3"><h4>Consent</h4><p>By using our Online Services, you are indicating that you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy and are expressly consenting to the processing of your data in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with any of the terms and conditions, or do not approve of TaskCall's data practices as described herein, then you should immediately stop using our Online Services. To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, any disputes regarding privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, or any other agreement between us and you, will be subject to the laws of the state of Delaware, USA.</p></div><div class="py-3"><h4 class="py-2">Types of Data Collected</h4><h5>Information provided by website visitors</h5><p>If you choose to sign up for information from TaskCall, schedule a demo, attend a virtual event, or create an account to use the Service, we may collect certain personally identifiable information (PII) from you, including your first and last name, organization name, job title, email address, phone number, location information (such as state/province and country). If you contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content or information included in or attached to your email, in order to respond to you. If you purchase services or products from us, we will also collect payment account and other financial information.</p><p>We may also combine the information we collect directly from you with information obtained from public sources, partners, and other third parties and use such combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><h5>Information collected by technological means</h5><p>Our servers, which may be hosted by a third-party service provider, collect technical data about your device and software when you use our Online Services. This data includes information about your browser type, operating system, IP address (a unique number assigned to your device when you connect to the Internet), domain name, and a time stamp of your visit. We automatically collect and store this data in log files each time you access our website or your account on our network. However, unless you have provided us with your personally identifiable information (PII), this technical data cannot be used to identify you. Additionally, we may collect analytics data directly or through third-party tools to help us understand traffic and usage trends of our Online Services.

While downloading or using the Apps, we don't request, access, or track your specific location information from your mobile device. However, we may infer your general geographic location based on your IP address. Our Apps may send push notifications, which you can disable at the device level if you no longer wish to receive them.</p><h5>Cookies and other tracking technologies</h5><p>We utilize various technical tools, such as cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies, to track the activities of our users on our Online Services.

We may transfer PII, including personal data about residents of the EEA and Switzerland, to our vendors, consultants, and other service providers who require access to such PII to perform work on our behalf. TaskCall will be responsible for the processing of such PII by a third-party service provider unless we can demonstrate that we are not responsible for the event that gave rise to the damages. We may also be required to disclose such PII in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li></ul></div><div class="py-3"><h4>Links To Other Applications</h4><p>Our Service may contain links to other sites or services that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site and service you visit.</p><p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p></div><div class="py-3"><h4>Data Security</h4><p>We take the security of the information we receive through our Online Services, including your PII, seriously. To that end, we implement reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to safeguard your PII from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For instance, we use secure socket layer technology (SSL) when providing our Online Services and require you to input a password to access your account information. It is essential that you keep your account password confidential and not disclose it to others. Although we make every effort to protect your PII, no security control is entirely risk-free, and we cannot guarantee that your PII will always be secure. You may refer to our Security Practices for up-to-date information on our security practices and policies.</p></div><div class="py-3"><h4>Data Independence</h4><p>To safeguard your privacy rights, we offer you options for controlling the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information (PII). If you receive newsletters or promotional emails from us, you can opt-out of receiving further communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in the email or contacting us directly. However, we reserve the right to send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, regardless of your email preferences.</p><p>You can also edit or delete your PII in your account on the Online Services, including your contact information and notification settings, by accessing your account profile. If you want us to delete your account information, you can email us at support@taskcallapp.com. However, please note that we may be required by law or other regulations to keep some information, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after fulfilling such requirements. We will respond to your requests within thirty (30) days or sooner if required by law. When we delete your account information, it will be removed from the active database but may remain in our archives for a limited time. We will otherwise retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you with the Online Services you have requested, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p><p>If a customer has registered for our Services, and your PII has been collected as a result of their use of our Services, we will process your information under the direction of the relevant customer. If you want to access, edit, delete, or exercise any rights under applicable data protection laws regarding any PII we have collected about you, please contact the relevant customer directly. We will, however, provide reasonable assistance to our customers to give effect to data subject rights as appropriate and required by applicable laws.</p><p>Please note that when we provide links to third-party sites, we do not endorse the contents of those sites or their privacy policies. Clicking on such a link will take you away from our site, and any data, including PII, that a third party collects from you will be subject to their privacy policy, not ours. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of any third-party websites you visit.</p><p>TaskCall offers its services from two primary regions – United States and the European Union (EU). Each region’s data is stored in isolated environments and never leave the region except for some basic PII information in some cases. By accessing or using our Online Services, or providing information to us, you understand that your PII information may be processed, transferred, and stored in other locations. If we transfer your Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to a country that does not have an adequate level of data protection, we will ensure that the recipient of your Personal Data offers an adequate level of protection, as required by applicable law. This may include measures such as entering into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or gaining prior consent.</p></div><div class="py-3"><h4>Children's Privacy</h4><p>Our Online Services are designed for use by individuals who are at least thirteen (13) years old or older.
