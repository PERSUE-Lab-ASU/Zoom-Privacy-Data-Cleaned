						<p align="justify">If your organization signed a RaeNotes Enterprise Agreement with RaeNotes, that Agreement may have modified the privacy policy below.
						</p><p>Thanks for using RaeNotes! Our mission is to create a more enlightened way of interaction with voice recordings by providing an intuitive, unified platform to store and organize audio and video files, transcribe, collaborate with others and unleash valuable data from those recordings. Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal information when you use our website, platform, and services <b>(“Services”)</b>. 
						</p>
						<h2><b>What &amp; Why</b></h2>
						<p align="justify">We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, and protect our Services:</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Account information.</span> We collect and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan (like your username, email address, profile picture, password, payment info, including your name, credit or debit card information, billing address, and details of your transaction history).</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Content.</span> Our Services are designed to make it simple for you to store your video and audio files, transcript, make notes(<b>“Your Content”</b>), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Content as well as information related to it. This related information includes your name and email address that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Content with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded and collaborators. Our Services provide you with an option for sharing Your Content.</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Usage information.</span> We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, and filter files or folders). We use this information to improve our Services, develop new services and features, and protect RaeNotes users. Please refer to our <!--<a href="faq.html" style="font-size:16px; color:blue;">FAQ</a>-->FAQ for more information about how we use this usage information to improve our Services.</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Device information.</span> We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Cookies.</span> We use cookies to provide, improve, and protect our Services. Cookies help us with things like recalling your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Marketing.</span> We give users the option to use our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services. If you register for our free Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time. If you do not want to receive marketing materials from us, simply click the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any email.</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Basis for processing your data:</span> We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such consent.</p>
						<p align="justify"><b>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of RaeNotes and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</b></p>
						<h2><b>With Whom we share data with:</b></h2>
						<p align="justify">We may share information as discussed below, but we won’t sell it to advertisers or other third parties.</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Third-party providers.</span> RaeNotes uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we’ll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions. Trusted third parties include:</p>
						<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left:30px">
						<li style="font-size:16px; font-weight:300"><b>Amazon Web Services, Inc.</b> to store and transcribe Your Content.<br>RaeNotes stores Your Content in data centers owned and operated by Amazon Web Services. These data centers deliver the very highest levels of physical and infrastructure security; more information can be found <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/data-centers/" style="font-size:16px; color:blue;">here</a>.</li>
						<li style="font-size:16px; font-weight:300"><b>Stripe, Inc.</b> for billing and payment.<br>RaeNotes uses Stripe, Inc. for billing and payment. Stripe Inc. stores this data in the USA.  To ensure this transfer is lawful, we rely on the fact that Stripe Inc. is certified as complying with the EU-US Privacy Shield regime.</li>
						<li style="font-size:16px; font-weight:300"><b>Microsoft Clarity and FullStory, Inc</b> to improve our Platform and customer experiences.<br>If you register for our free Services RaeNotes may use Microsoft Clarity and FullStory, Inc. to analyze customer experiences for troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, system maintenance, support. RaeNotes has executed a GDPR-compliant DPA with FullStory, Inc.</li>
						</ul>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Other users.</span> Our Services display information like your name, profile picture, and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications. You can also share Your Content with other users if you choose. When you register your RaeNotes account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making some of your basic information—like your name, team name, profile picture, and email address—visible to other users on the same domain. This helps you synch up with teams you can join and helps other users share files with you.</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic" }="">Law &amp; Order and the Public Interest.</span>  We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) prevent fraud or abuse of RaeNotes or our users; (c) protect RaeNotes’s rights, property, safety, or interest; or (d) perform a task carried out in the public interest.</p>
						<h2><b>How</b></h2>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:500" }="">Security.</span> We keep your information secure and continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like access control list, encryption of data at rest. RaeNotes uses industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit. All connections to RaeNotes are encrypted using SSL, and any attempt to connect over HTTP is redirected to HTTPS. All customer data (including call recordings and transcripts) is encrypted at rest and in transit.System passwords are encrypted using AWS KMS with restricted access to specific production systems. We use industry-standard PostgreSQL, Elastic Search data storage systems hosted at AWS.</p>
						<p align="justify">We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users. No one at RaeNotes can view Your Content unless you expressly give us permission or it’s necessary to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:500" }="">Secure Infrastructure.</span> Raenotes services are hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS maintains strict physical access policies that utilize sophisticated physical access control mechanisms. Environmental controls such as uninterruptible power and non-destructive fire suppression are integrated elements of all data centers. AWS uses multiple geographically distributed data centers as part of a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy, and uses the CIS Amazon Web Services Benchmarks (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/compliance-cis-benchmark/" style="font-size:16px; color:blue">https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/compliance-cis-benchmark/)</a> as a guide for best practices. AWS provides DDOS services.</p>
						<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:500" }="">User Controls.</span> You can access, amend, download, and delete your personal information by logging into your RaeNotes  account and going to your account settings page. You have control over who sees Your Content. RaeNotes uses an access-control list (ACL) to specify which users are granted access to files, as well as what operations are allowed on given files. You can expressly give permissions to specific people or you can make your data public and available to anyone on the web who have the link (URL) to the file. You can also assign the level of access to the shared files. You can set the access permissions to either view (read only), comment (read and post comments), edit (read, write, comment), edit and share.</p>

If you delete your account, we will initiate deletion of this information after 30 days. <!--Learn more <a href="faq.html" style="font-size:16px; color:blue;">here</a>.-->But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.</p>
