This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors. </p><h4 _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">CAN SPAM Act</h4><p _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762=""> The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations. <br _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762=""> We collect your email address in order to: </p><ul _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762=""><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762=""> Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions </li><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred. </li></ul><p _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762=""> To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following: </p><ul _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762=""><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li></ul><p _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762=""> If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence. </p><h4 _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Contacting Us</h4><p _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us using the information on our <a _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="" routerlink="/contact" href="/contact">contact us</a> page. </p><p _ngcontent-ng-c2200658762="">Last Edited on 2020-09-24</p></div></div></app-privacy-policy><!----></app-layout><!----></app-root>
