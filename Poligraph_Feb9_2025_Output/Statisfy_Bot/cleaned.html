To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of such information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, the purposes for which we process it, and the applicable legal requirements.</p><h2>Other sites, mobile applications and services</h2><p>Our Services may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us.

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on our Services. We may also provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach you, such as via e-mail (if you have an account where we have your contact information) or another manner through our Services.</p><p>Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on our Services (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the Services after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.</p><h2>How to contact us</h2><p>If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach us by email at privacy@statisfy.us.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="section-footer"><div class="footer-top-row"></div><div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container w-container"><div class="footer-box"><div class="footer-left"><div class="footer-logo-box"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65b1f10c81fdc97f3e523cea/65ba49705f15176de66c3440_logo-white.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="footer-logo"></div><div class="copyright-text">© 2024 Statisfy. &nbsp;All rights reserved.</div></div><div class="footer-right"><div class="footer-link-block"><a href="/privacy-policy" aria-current="page" class="footer-link w--current">Privacy Policy</a><a href="/terms-of-service" class="footer-link">Terms of Service</a><a href="/security-and-compliance" class="footer-link">Security and Compliance</a></div><div class="footer-link-block mb0"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/statisfy" class="footer-social-link linkedin w-inline-block"></a><a href="#" class="footer-social-link twitter w-inline-block"></a></div></div></div></div></section><!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
