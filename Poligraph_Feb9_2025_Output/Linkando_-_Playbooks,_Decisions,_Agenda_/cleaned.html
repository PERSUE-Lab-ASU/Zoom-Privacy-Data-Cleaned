This allows the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they have been redirected to the provider's website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This allows the effectiveness of Facebook ads to be evaluated for statistical and market research purposes and future advertising measures to be optimized.</p>
                <p>The data collected is anonymous for us as the operator of this website; we cannot draw any conclusions about the identity of the user. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Facebook Data Usage Policy.

These are all integrated in "extended data protection mode", i.e. no data about you as a user is transferred to YouTube if you do not play the videos. Only when you play the videos will the data mentioned in paragraph 2 be transmitted. We have no influence on this data transfer.</p>
                <p>We have also integrated content from the following third-party providers on this website: Google Maps and Google Web Fonts (external fonts).</p>

                <p><b>Scope and description of the processing of personal data<br></b>Our website uses the web analysis service Matomo, an open source solution.</p>
                <p>Matomo stores cookies on your end device that enable your use of our website to be analyzed. The information collected in this way is stored exclusively on our server, namely the following data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>two bytes of the IP address of the user's calling system</li>
                    <li>the website accessed</li>
                    <li>the website from which the user accessed the website (referrer)</li>
                    <li>the subpages that are accessed from the accessed website</li>
                    <li>the time spent on the website</li>
                    <li>the frequency with which the website is accessed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our website uses Matomo with the setting "Anonymize Visitors' IP addresses". This means that IP addresses are further processed in abbreviated form, thus excluding the possibility of direct personal identification. The software is set so that the IP addresses are not stored in full, but 2 bytes of the IP address are masked (e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx). In this way, it is no longer possible to assign the shortened IP address to the calling computer. The IP address transmitted by your browser via Matomo is not merged with other data collected by us.</p>
                <p><b>Legal basis for the processing of personal data<br></b>The legal basis for the processing of the user's data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or § 15 para. 3 TMG.</p>
                <p><b>Purposes of processing<br></b>We use Matomo to analyze the use of our website and individual functions and offers in order to continuously improve the user experience. By statistically evaluating user behavior, we improve our offer and make it more interesting for visitors.</p>
                <p><b>Duration of storage<br></b>The data of the processing described here will be deleted after a storage period of 90 days.</p>

                <p>If you do not wish to be analyzed by Brevo, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. We provide a link for this purpose in every newsletter message.</p>
                <p><b>Data analysis by Brevo</b></p>
                <p>With the help of Brevo, we are able to analyze our newsletter campaigns. For example, we can see whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. In this way, we can determine, among other things, which links were clicked on particularly often.</p>
                <p>Brevo also allows us to subdivide ("cluster") newsletter recipients according to various categories. The newsletter recipients can be subdivided according to the selection of the desired newsletter. In this way, the newsletters can be better adapted to the respective target groups.</p>
                <h3>j) Weglot</h3>
                <p>Functions of the Weglot translation service are integrated on this website. The provider is Weglot SAS, 138, rue Pierre Joigneaux in Bois-Colombes 92270 France. Weglot is loaded when the website is called up so that you can select your preferred language via the language icon in the header of the website. This enables a direct connection to be established between your browser and the Weglot server when you visit this website.

A corresponding consent is requested via the cookie and data protection settings of the website.

                <h3>k) Mobile Funnel</h3>
                <p>Processing of (personal) data by the operator of the Mobile Funnel</p>
                <p><b>General information<br></b>This website uses Mobile Funnel (hereinafter: Funnel), operated by Perspective Software GmbH (hereinafter: Perspective), a company based in Germany, which offers software for the creation and operation of Mobile Funnel (https://perspective.co/impressum). The data entered when using Mobile Funnels is transmitted using SSL encryption and stored in a database. The operator of this website is solely responsible for this data within the meaning of Art. 24 GDPR. Perspective is merely the operator of the software and, in this context, a processor in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR. The basis for the processing by Perspective is an order processing contract between the controller and Perspective. In addition, Perspective Software GmbH processes further data, some of which may also be personal data, in order to provide its services, in particular for the operation of the Mobile Funnel. This is discussed in more detail below.</p>
                <p><b>Responsible body<br></b>The responsible body within the meaning of data protection law is:<br>Perspective Software GmbH<br>Müggelstraße 22<br>10247 Berlin</p>
                <p>E-mail: privacy@perspective.co</p>
                <p><b>Access logs ("server logs")<br></b>General log data, so-called server logs, are automatically recorded each time the Funnel is accessed. These data are generally pseudonyms and therefore do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about a natural person. Without this data, it would not be technically possible in some cases to deliver and display the content of the software. In addition, the processing of this data is absolutely necessary for security reasons, in particular for access, input, transmission and storage control. In addition, the anonymous information can be used for statistical purposes and to optimize the offering and technology. In addition, the log files can be subsequently checked and analyzed in the event of suspected illegal use of the software. The</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this can be found in Section 15 (1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) and Art. 6 (1) f GDPR. In general, data such as the domain name of the website, the web browser and web browser version, the operating system and the timestamp of access to the software are recorded. The user's IP address is not stored. However, the user is assigned a so-called session ID. The scope of this logging does not exceed the usual scope of any other website on the Internet. The storage period of these access logs is up to 7 days. There is no right of objection.</p>
                <p><b>Collection of user behavior data<br></b>In general, data such as the domain name of the website, the web browser and web browser version, the operating system, the session ID of the user and the time stamp of access to the software are collected. All data that the user enters when using the Funnel (e.g. answering form fields; use of interactive components) is assigned to the user by means of a session ID and made available to the operator of this website. The operator of this website is responsible for the deletion, storage and further processing of this personal data in accordance with current legislation.</p>
                <p><b>Use of cookies<br></b>So-called cookies are used in the funnels. These are small text files that are stored on the device you use to access these funnels. The cookies used serve to ensure security when visiting a website ("strictly necessary"), to implement certain functionalities such as standard language settings ("functional") and to improve the user experience or performance on the website ("performance"). Strictly necessary, functional and performance cookies are used within the funnels, in particular to implement certain default settings such as the language, to store answers given even with a poor internet connection or to analyze the performance of a funnel and the channel used by a user to access this funnel. The use of cookies is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and thus for the fulfillment of the contract (Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR). Storage duration: Up to 1 month or until the end of the browser session Right to object: You can use your browser settings to determine whether you want to allow cookies or object to the use of cookies. Please note that deactivating cookies can lead to limited or completely disabled functionality of the Funnel. The operator of this website has the option of deciding individually for each funnel used which options for the use of cookies are given to the user. It is the responsibility of the website operator to use cookies in accordance with the applicable legal restrictions. If the website operator uses extensions from external companies within the funnels, it is the responsibility of the website operator to inform the user about this.</p>
                <p><b>Rights of data subjects<br></b>If personal data is processed by Perspective Software GmbH as the controller, you as the data subject have certain rights under Chapter III of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), depending on the legal basis and purpose of the processing, in particular the right of access (Art. 15 GDPR), right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR), right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR), right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR), right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR), right to object (Art. 21 GDPR). If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw this data protection consent in accordance with Art. 7 III GDPR. To assert your rights as a data subject with regard to the data processed for the operation of the Funnel, please contact the data protection officer of Perspective Software GmbH (see section B.).</p>
                <p><b>Final provisions<br></b>Perspective reserves the right to amend this privacy policy at any time to ensure that it always complies with current legal requirements or to implement changes to the services in the privacy policy, e.g. when introducing new services. The new privacy policy will then apply when you visit the funnel again.</p>

                <h2>4. Processing of personal data for submissions and inquiries</h2>
                <p>In connection with submissions and inquiries, we only process data that is necessary to communicate with you and to properly document the business processes. This includes, in particular, personal information (e.g. surname, first name, address, e-mail address, etc.) that we have received directly from you as well as information about the contact method you have chosen (letter, telephone, e-mail, contact form). The processing of the data is necessary for the performance of our tasks (see Article 6(1)(e) and (3)(b) GDPR in conjunction with Section 3 BDSG).</p>
                <p>We will only pass on the data we receive from you to third parties if you have expressly consented to this or if we are obliged to do so by law or on the basis of a court decision. The storage of submissions and inquiries in electronic form - as well as in paper form - is carried out in accordance with the statutory periods applicable to the storage of documents. As a rule, the retention periods for this are 10 years.</p>
                <p>Data processing outside the EU takes place with regard to the sending of emails. Here, our service provider "Chimpify" uses the provider "Sendgrid". The necessary measures have been taken to ensure an appropriate level of data protection. The so-called EU standard contractual clauses, which can be found on the EU Commission's website, are used for this purpose.</p>

                <p>If you subscribe to the Linkando GmbH newsletter mailing list, your email address, the newsletter you have selected and optionally your name will be stored on a server.

We do not pass on your data to third parties and do not use it for any other purposes of our own.</p>
                <p>When you register, your data is stored on a server and a confirmation message with a link to the final registration is generated and sent to the e-mail address you have provided.

                <p>If your organization grants you access to Linkando Products, your use of Linkando Products may be subject to your organization's policies.

                <h2>7. Rights of data subjects</h2>
                <p>Linkando GmbH is responsible for the processing of personal data both in the context of fulfilling our tasks and as a contracting party under civil law. The data subjects therefore have the following rights under the GDPR:</p>
                <h3>a) Right of access - Article 15 GDPR</h3>
                <p>The right to information gives the data subject comprehensive insight into the data concerning him/her and some other important criteria such as the purposes of processing or the duration of storage. The exceptions to this right set out in §34 BDSG apply.</p>
                <h3>b) Right to rectification - Article 16 GDPR</h3>
                <p>The right to rectification includes the possibility for the data subject to have incorrect personal data concerning them corrected.</p>
                <h3>c) Right to erasure - Article 17 GDPR</h3>
                <p>The right to erasure includes the possibility for the data subject to have data erased by the controller. However, this is only possible if the personal data in question is no longer necessary, is being processed unlawfully or consent has been withdrawn. The exceptions to this right set out in §35 BDSG apply.</p>
                <h3>d) Right to restriction of processing - Article 18 GDPR</h3>
                <p>The right to restriction of processing includes the possibility for the data subject to prevent further processing of the personal data concerning them for the time being. A restriction occurs primarily in the review phase of other rights exercised by the data subject.</p>
                <h3>e) Right to data portability - Article 20 GDPR</h3>
                <p>The right to data portability includes the possibility for the data subject to receive the personal data concerning him/her from the controller in a commonly used, machine-readable format in order to have it forwarded to another controller if necessary.</p>
                <h3>f) Right to object - Article 21 GDPR</h3>
                <p>The right to object includes the possibility for data subjects to object to the further processing of their personal data in a particular situation, insofar as this is justified by the performance of public tasks or public and private interests. According to §36 BDSG, the right does not apply if a public body is obliged to process the data by law.</p>
                <h3>g) Right to withdraw consent</h3>
                <p>Insofar as the processing of personal data is based on your consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR), you can revoke this consent at any time for the corresponding purpose. The lawfulness of the processing based on your consent remains unaffected until receipt of your revocation.<br></p>
                <h2>Possibility of complaint</h2>
