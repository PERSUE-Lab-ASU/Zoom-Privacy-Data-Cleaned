<p>If we ask you to provide personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to enter into a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations).

<p>We collect sensitive personal information for various purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>to uniquely identify you and for tax reporting purposes;</li>
<li>to comply with our legal obligations pursuant to applicable federal and state employment laws and regulations, including collecting and disclosing personal information as required by law (e.g., for minimum wage, payroll tax, as well as to comply with equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws);</li>
<li>to facilitate and provide reasonable accommodations; and</li>
<li>to facilitate other business purposes as enumerated under the CCPA.</li>
</ul>
<p>As defined by the CCPA, sensitive personal information shall be treated as personal information, except where it is collected or processed for “the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer.” We do not collect or process sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about individuals.</p>
<p>Further information regarding the categories of personal information we collect and the sources from which we collect it are described in the section above titled “<a href="#two">What personal information do we collect?</a>“. The business and commercial purposes for which we collect this information are described in the section titled “<a href="#twohalf">How do we use the personal information we collect?</a>“. The categories of third parties to whom we “disclose” this personal information for a business purpose are described in the section titled “<a href="#three">Who do we share your personal information with</a>“.</p>
<p>When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter into a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to keep that personal information confidential and use it only for performance of the contract, and not for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Gainsight does not “sell” your personal information in exchange for any monetary consideration. We do share certain information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes as defined by the CCPA under Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140(ad)(2). Some of our processing activities may also constitute “targeted advertising” as that term is defined under certain state laws.</p>
<p>We have shared in the preceding 12 months personal information as necessary for business purposes, as defined by Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140. This includes sharing personal identifiers, commercial information, and internet or other electronic network activity with customer relationship management, consulting, e-mail, product feedback, helpdesk services, advertising networks and website analytics companies. You have a right to direct Gainsight not to sell or share your personal information. We do not have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared personal information of individuals under the age of 16 for targeted advertising or cross-context behavioral advertising purposes.</p>
<p>For more information on how to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information, please see the subsection “<a href="#twelvehalf">Your Rights and How to Exercise Them</a>” below.<br>
However, please note that your use of our Websites may still be tracked by us and our vendors or partners to perform functions that are necessary for our businesses, such as hosting our Website, products and services, ensuring there is no fraud (click-fraud, fraudulent or bot traffic), etc. These entities are contractually obligated to keep such information confidential, and will not use it for any purpose other than for the services they provide to us.<br>
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="#twelvehalf">Your Rights and How to Exercise Them</h2>
<p>California residents have certain rights under the CCPA. Those rights may only apply in certain circumstances and may be subject to limitations or exceptions. A summary of those rights is provided below as well as information on how to exercise your rights. Please note that we will require certain identifying information about you as necessary for us to verify your request in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You have the right to know what personal information we collect, use, disclose and/or sell about you. To exercise this right, please <a href="https://www.gainsight.com/policy/california-consumer-privacy-act-individual-rights-request-form/">click here</a> and complete the web form.

<li><strong>Right to Opt Out of Sale:</strong> You have the right to opt out or ask us not to sell your personal information.

You may also submit your request by calling 1-888-623-8562 option 6. We do not sell your personal information in exchange for money. We do share certain information with third parties to market products, services, and other offers we think may be of interest to you. The CCPA broadly defines the concept of “selling” information so we offer the opportunity for California residents to opt out of our sharing information with third parties in this manner. Please note that if you opt out of this information sharing with us, we will remove you from these activities; however, other companies may continue to use and disclose your information in the same manner. You should opt out of these practices with those other companies and websites, as applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You have the right to request us to delete the personal information we collect or maintain about you. To exercise this right, please click here and complete the web form. You may also submit your request by calling 1-888-623-8562 option 6.

We will notify you if any such exceptions apply to your request.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer certain financial incentives, charge reasonable fees related to your requests, or deny your right to know, right to opt out of sale or right to deletion in accordance with applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may ask you to provide information that will enable us to verify your identity in order to comply with your request to exercise your privacy rights. You can exercise these rights yourself or you can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. Your authorized agent must be able to demonstrate authority to act on your behalf when submitting a verifiable request on your behalf. In some instances, we may decline to honor your request if an exception applies under applicable law. We will respond to your request in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.</p>
<p>You may have the right to appeal our decisions made with respect to your request. To appeal our decision on your request, you may contact us through one of the contact methods described under the <a href="#fourteen">Contact Us</a> section below).. Please enclose a copy of, or otherwise specifically reference, our decision on your request, so that we may adequately address your appeal. We will respond to your appeal in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. To request the above information, please contact us using the contact details provided below [insert link] with a reference to “CA Disclosure Information” and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.

To request such information, please contact us through one of the contact methods described under the <a href="#fourteen">Contact Us</a> section below).</p>
<p>Please allow 30 days for a response. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year and you will not be charged for this request.</p>
