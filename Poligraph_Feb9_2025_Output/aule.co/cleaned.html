          <h2 class="text-muted mb-5">Privacy Policy</h2>

          <p class="text-muted">Effective date: 2022-10-11</p>

          <p class="text-muted">Your privacy is critically important to us. At Aule Group we have a few fundamental
            principles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-muted">
              We never share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law,
              develop our products, or protect our rights.
            </li>
            <li class="text-muted">
              We do not collect unnecessary personal information; only information your school
              needs to best use Aule Group is stored.
            </li>
            <li class="text-muted">
              We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to change your account information,
              or deactivate your Aule Group account.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-muted">Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Aule Group ("website") operates at aule.co, and also at any sub directories
            ([--].aule.co). It is Aule Group's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect,
            or is provided by your school, while operating our websites.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-muted">Website Users</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Due to the format of Aule Group's service, much of the information associated with your
            account is inputted by your school's administrators. Additionally, like most website operators, Aule Group
            collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
            available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. Aule’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
            how Aule’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Aule Group may release non-personally-identifying
            information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website, or by
            making it available to teachers or school administrators.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Aule Group also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
            Protocol (IP) addresses. Aule Group does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and
            does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information, as described below.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-muted">Use of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Aule Group's users interact with Aule Group in ways that require Aule Group to use personally-identifying
            information. Login email addresses (provided to us by your school) identify who you are, and may be changed
            at any time (these will never be disclosed to a third party, see below). Passwords are initially set to a
            default, but may be willfully changed to suite you. Credit cards, addresses, and other such identifying
            information is never collected. In each case, Aule Group collects such information only insofar as is
            necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Aule Group. Aule Group
            does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Aule Group's servers also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
            Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Aule Group does not use such information to identify its visitors,
            however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and
            discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-muted">Aggregated Statistics</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Aule Group may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For
            instance, Aule Group may monitor the most popular word sets on the Aule Group site. Aule Group may display
            this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Aule Group does not disclose
            personally-identifying information other than as described below.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-muted">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Aule Group discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know
            that information in order to process it on Aule Group's behalf or to provide services available at Aule
            Group's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Aule Group's
            websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Aule Group will not rent or sell
            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
            employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Aule Group discloses potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when
            Aule Group believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
            of Aule Group, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Aule Group website
            and have supplied your email address, Aule Group may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
            features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Aule Group and our
            products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect
            to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
            one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond
            to your request or to help us support other users. Aule Group takes all measures reasonably necessary to
            protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-muted">Data Retention</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Aule Group retains your personal information for as long as it is necessary in order to
            fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. We may retain your personal information for longer if it
            turns out to be the subject of a legal claim, or may otherwise be relevant for future litigation.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-muted">Cookies</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">
            A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and
            that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Aule Group uses cookies to
            help Aule Group identify and track visitors, their usage of Aule Group website, and their website access
            preferences. Aule Group visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
            browsers to refuse cookies before using Aule Group's websites, with the drawback that certain features of
            Aule Group's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-muted">Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Although most changes are likely to be minor, Aule Group may change its Privacy Policy
            from time to time, and in Aule Group's sole discretion. Aule Group encourages visitors to frequently check
            this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Aule Group account, you should also check
            your blog's dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
            Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
