<h3>1. What this Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
<p>Protecting your privacy is really important to us. Accordingly, we are providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our website(s) located at www.kore.ai (the “Site(s)”), our mobile device application (“App”), and our services available via the Sites or App, which include (i) bots; (ii) instant messaging sharing, networking and collaboration between individual consumer users and between individuals and among members of teams within an organization; and (iii) other services made available via the Sites or App from time to time. To make the terms in this Privacy Policy easier to read, our Site, services (including bots, messaging and networking, and other services) and App are collectively called the “Services”. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p>
<h3>2. Information We Gather</h3>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide Services and improve them, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>
<p><a class="home_content_link_tracking" name="_Hlk514675120"></a>Account Information. To use the Services you will have to create an account (“Account”). When you create an Account we will collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, phone number, profile photo and credit card information, if applicable (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”). We may also collect certain information that is not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as business postal address, employer, and job title. If you create an Account, on behalf of an organization, we’ll collect your organization’s corporate name, email address, postal address, phone number and billing information. PII gathered shall be stored with our processor – Hubspot in accordance with applicable laws across the globe, including GDPR requirements. We may use your PII to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of all newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, and other information.</p>
<h3>3. Visitor Information</h3>
<p>If you join our waitlist for future features or for receiving updates from our Services, we’ll collect your PII, such as your name and email address. We may use your PII to contact you by email any time we release a new feature or updates. You have the right to opt out of the same.</p>
<h3>4. Cookies</h3>
<p>For the purposes of the Services, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information. “Cookies” are small text files that are placed, with your consent, on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. With your consent, we may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you have logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. With your consent, we may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by any third parties.</p>
<h3>5. Web Beacons</h3>
<p>“Web Beacons” (also known as clear gifs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p>
<h3>6. Information Related to Use of the Services</h3>
<p>Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, frequency with which of our Services are used by a User, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on, the ads that User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used. Please note that during this, at no point of time do we collect and/or share PII collected with any third parties apart from the data processor(s).</p>
<h3>7. Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</h3>
<p>We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</p>
<h3>8. Location Information</h3>
<p>In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or through GPS or sensor data from your device that provides information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers to locate your mobile device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</p>
<h3>9. Information Shared with Third Parties</h3>
<p>With your prior written consent, your PII is shared via the Services as described below:</p>
<p>Information Shared with other Account Holders. As part of our Services, Account holders may communicate with other Account holders through the use of our direct messaging functionality or via forums and when this happens those other Account holders will be able to see certain information about you, such as your name or photo – this will depend on how your privacy settings are selected via the Services. In addition, the content of your communications will be visible and available to those other Account holders, including Content you share or upload when using the Services. If you are an Enterprise Use Account holder with permission to login to the Admin Panel, you will be able to view all communications taking place between Account holders within your organization and all the Content shared or posted. We encourage you to use your good judgment for such communications and not to post or share any private or sensitive information or Content.</p>
<p>Information shared with Data processor – Your PII shall be shared with our Data Processor, Hubspot, in accordance with the applicable laws, including, for European Union member countries residents, with GDPR requirements. Hubspot complies with applicable GDPR guidelines for the storage and processing of personal data and its safe transfer.</p>
<h3>10. Information Shared with Our Service Providers</h3>
<p>We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.</p>
<p>Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p>
<h3>11. Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</h3>
<p>Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction. Any such disclosure shall be in accordance with any and all legal requirements applicable.</p>
<h3>12. Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</h3>
<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
<h3>13. Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request</h3>
<p>We will share your PII with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.</p>
<h3>14. Invite a Friend</h3>
<p>Through the Services, Account holders can also invite non-Account holders to try the Services by a specific functionality of the Services. When an Account holder invites someone to try the Services, an SMS or automated email will be sent to the invitee indicating that a particular Account holder has invited such invitee to try the Services and this SMS or email will include a link to the appropriate app store or distribution platform where the App is made available.</p>
<h3>15. The Security of Your Information</h3>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by encrypting all data while stored and in transit via our Services, including User’s information, messages and any Content attached to the messages. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
<h3>16. Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p>
<h3>17. Modifying Your Information</h3>
<p>You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account through the settings feature on your Account profile. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at privacy@kore.ai with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<h3>18. International Transfer</h3>
<p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</p>
<h3>19. Our Policy Towards Children</h3>
<p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>20. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time that Information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification at our sole discretion and we’ll indicate when those changes will become effective.</p>
