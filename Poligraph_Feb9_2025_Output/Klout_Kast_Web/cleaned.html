<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Klout Kast Product.</p>
<h1>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</h1>
<p>To provide the Klout Kast Product, we must process information about you. The types of information we collect depend on how you use our Products.</p>
<h2>Things you and others do and provide.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information and content, you provide.</strong> We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process content and communications you and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes described below.</li>
<li><strong>Data with special protections.</strong> You can choose to provide information in your Klout Kast profile fields or Life Events about your religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject to special protections under the laws of your country.</li>
<li><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.</li>
<li><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products, such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect information about how you use features like our camera.</li>
<li><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card information; other account and authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.</li>
<li><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also receive and analyze content, communications and information that other people provide when they use our Products. This can include information about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Device Information</h2>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>

<li><strong>Data from device settings</strong>: information you allow us to receive through device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or photos.</li>
<li><strong>Network and connections</strong>: information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</li>

<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Klout Kast Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first.

If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted.</p>
<h1>V. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</h1>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
<ul>
<li>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.</li>
<li>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
