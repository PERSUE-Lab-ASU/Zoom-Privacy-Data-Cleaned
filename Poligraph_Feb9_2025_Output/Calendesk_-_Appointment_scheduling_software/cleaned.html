In such a situation, we act as a processor who provides such a service provider with the appropriate IT tool.</p><h2 id="header_2">#2: Who can you contact regarding the processing of your personal data?</h2><p>As part of the implementation of personal data protection in our company, we have decided not to appoint a data protection officer due to the fact that in our case it is not mandatory.

Do we make automated decisions based on your personal data?</h2><p>We do not make decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that would have legal effects on you or that would similarly significantly affect you. We do use tools that can take specific actions depending on the information collected as part of the tracking mechanisms but we believe that these actions do not have a significant impact on you for they do not differentiate your situation as a customer, they do not affect the terms of the contract you can enter into with us, etc.</p><p>Using certain tools, we may, for example, target personalised advertisements to you based on previous actions taken by you within Calendesk. This is called behavioural advertising. We encourage you to learn more about behavioural advertising, particularly with regard to privacy issues. Detailed information, including the ability to manage your behavioural advertising settings, can be found <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h2 id="header_12">#12: What rights do you have with regard to the processing of your personal data?</h2><p>The GDPR grants you the following potential rights related to the processing of your personal data:</p><ul role="list"><li>the right to access your data and obtain a copy thereof;</li><li>the right to demand the rectification of the data;</li><li>the right to erase the data (if in your opinion there are no grounds for us to process your data, you can request that we erase them);</li><li>the right to restriction of data processing (you can request that we restrict the processing of data only to their storage or performance of activities agreed with you if in your opinion we have incorrect data or we process them unjustifiably);</li><li>the right to object to the processing of data (you have the right to object to the processing of data on the basis of a legitimate interest; you should indicate a specific situation that, in your opinion, justifies the termination of the processing covered by the objection; we will stop processing your data for these purposes unless we prove that the grounds for data processing by us override your rights or that your data are necessary for us to establish, assert, or defend claims);</li><li>the right to transfer data (you have the right to receive from us, in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, personal data that you provided to us on the basis of a contract or your consent; you can commission us to send these data directly to another entity);</li><li>the right to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data if you previously gave such consent;</li><li>the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory body (if you find that we are processing data unlawfully, you can submit a complaint to the President of the Personal Data Protection Office or another competent supervisory authority).</li></ul><p>The rules related to the implementation of the above-mentioned rights are described in detail in Articles 16–21 of the GDPR. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these provisions. For our part, we consider it necessary to explain to you that the above-mentioned rights are not absolute and you will not be entitled to them in relation to all activities involving the processing of your personal data.</p><p>We shall emphasize that you always have one of the rights indicated above — if you believe that we have breached the provisions on the protection of personal data while processing your personal data, you have the option to lodge a complaint with the supervisory body (the President of the Personal Data Protection Office).</p><h2 id="header_13">#13: Do we use cookies, and what are they exactly?</h2><p>Calendesk, like almost all other applications or websites, uses cookies. Cookies are small text information stored on your end device (e.g. computer, tablet, smartphone), which can be read by our ICT system (first-party cookies) or ICT systems of third parties (third-party cookies). Cookies can record and store certain information which ICT systems can then access for specific purposes.</p><p>Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, i.e. after closing it (so-called session cookies).

Cookies created in incognito mode are deleted when you close all incognito mode windows.</p><p>There are also browser plug-ins for controlling cookies, such as <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/" target="_blank">Ghostery</a>. The option to control cookies may also be provided by additional software, in particular anti-virus packages, etc.</p><p>In addition, there are tools available on the Internet that allow you to control some types of cookies, in particular for <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices" target="_blank">collective management of behavioural advertising settings</a>.</p><p>Please bear in mind that disabling or limiting the use of cookies may prevent you from using some of the functions available on Calendesk and cause difficulties in using Calendesk, as well as many other websites that use cookies.
