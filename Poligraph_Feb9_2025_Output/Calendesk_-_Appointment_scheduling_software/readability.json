It is the entity alone that decides the purposes and means of processing personal data within the framework of the contract they enter into, and it is also the entity alone that is responsible for complying with all obligations from the GDPR, including providing information about the principles of personal data processing. In such a situation, we act as a processor who provides such a service provider with the appropriate IT tool.</p><p>As part of the implementation of personal data protection in our company, we have decided not to appoint a data protection officer due to the fact that in our case it is not mandatory.

For information in this regard, please refer to <a href=\"#header_3\">section 3 of the Privacy Policy</a> above.</p><p>We use tools that collect a range of information about you related to your use of Calendesk. This includes, in particular, the following information:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>information about your operating system and browser,</li><li>pages viewed and user involvement,</li><li>time spent on the Calendesk website,</li><li>transitions between pages,</li><li>clicks on individual links,</li><li>the source from which you go to Calendesk,</li><li>your age range,</li><li>your gender,</li><li>your approximate location limited to the town,</li><li>your interests as determined by your online activity,</li><li>platform statistics (iOS/Android/Web platforms),</li><li>crashlytics (recording your device and location in the source code where crashes occurred).</li></ul><p>This information is referred to in this Privacy Policy as \"Anonymous Information\".</p><p>Anonymous Information in itself does not, in our view, have the character of personal data, for it does not allow us to identify you and we do not match it with the typical personal data we collect about you. Nevertheless, given the strict jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the divided opinions among lawyers, as a precaution, in case Anonymous Information is attributed the character of personal data, we have also included detailed explanations in the Privacy Policy regarding the processing of this information.</p><p>The processing of Anonymous Information allows us to provide you with the functionality available within Calendesk. In addition, Anonymous Information is used for analytical and statistical as well as marketing purposes (e.g. creating Custom Audiences on Facebook, setting, targeting and directing advertisements).</p><p>Anonymous Information is also processed by tool providers under the terms of their Terms of Conditions and Privacy Policies. It may be used by these providers to provide, improve and manage services, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertisements, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalise the content and advertisements displayed on individual services, websites, and applications. Please see the section on the tools we use for more detailed information.</p><p>In most cases, you provide them to us yourself. For example, this is the case when you register a user account, conclude a contract, send a complaint or withdraw from a contract, contact us via email or chat, or use the functionalities available within Calendesk or external services (e.g. social networks).</p><p>In addition, some information about you may be automatically collected by tools we use. For details on the tools of external providers, please see the section on the tools we use.</p><p>Additionally, in exceptional cases, we may also obtain your personal data from other sources, e.g. when the entity that employs you indicates your data to us as a contact person for contractual matters, or when you represent an entity that enters into a contract with us.</p><p>We do care about the security of your personal data. We have analyzed the risks associated with the various data processing processes and then implemented appropriate security and data protection measures. We constantly monitor the state of our technical infrastructure, train our staff, observe the procedures applied, and make necessary improvements.</p><p>We process your personal data for as long as it is justified within the framework of a given purpose for processing your personal data, and therefore processing periods vary depending on the purpose. Please note that the termination of the processing of your data for one purpose does not necessarily lead to the complete erasure or destruction of your personal data since the same set of data may be processed for another purpose, for the period of time indicated for that purpose. Complete erasure or destruction of data occurs when all purposes have been completed and in other cases indicated in the GDPR.</p><p>Below you will find a description of the processing periods:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>User account</strong> \u2013 data related to the user account are processed for the duration of the user account;</li><li><strong>Conclusion and handling of the contract</strong> \u2013 contract-related data are processed for the time necessary to conclude and perform the contract;</li><li><strong>Complaints and withdrawals</strong> \u2013 data related to complaints and withdrawals are processed for the time necessary to handle the complaint or withdrawal;</li><li><strong>Contact and correspondence</strong> \u2013 data related to correspondence handling will be processed for the duration of the contact between us;</li><li><strong>Tax and accounting obligations</strong> \u2013 data related to the fulfilment of tax and accounting obligations will be processed for the time prescribed by tax law, usually 5 years after the end of the tax year;</li><li><strong>Archive</strong> \u2013 data related to the archive will be processed until the information contained in the archive is no longer relevant;</li><li><strong>Defence against claims, establishment of claims, and redress</strong> \u2013 data related to claims will be processed until the claims are time-barred, and the period of limitation for claims may vary in light of the applicable legislation (e.g. for businesses the standard period is 3 years);</li><li><strong>Social media</strong> \u2013 data related to social media audience will be processed until you opt out of interacting with us on social media;</li><li><strong>Analysis and statistics</strong> \u2013 data related to analytics and statistics will be processed until they are no longer useful or until you effectively object;</li><li><strong>Own marketing</strong> \u2013 data related to own marketing will be processed until they become obsolete or until you effectively object;</li><li><strong>Ancillary tools</strong> \u2013 data related to ancillary tools will be processed until they are no longer useful or you effectively object;</li><li><strong>Data protection obligations</strong> \u2013 data related to the protection of personal data will be processed until the expiry of their relevance, your effective objection, or the expiry of the limitation period for our liability as a personal data controller;</li><li><strong>DSA related obligations</strong> \u2013 data relating to ensuring DSA compliance shall be processed until the expiry of the statute of limitations on our liability as an intermediary service provider;</li><li><strong>Storage of User Content</strong> \u2014 data relating to the storage of User Content shall be stored until the User Content is removed.</li></ul><p>In the event that we process your personal data on the basis of consent you have given, you can withdraw such consent at any time: either by your action or by contacting us using the contact details provided.

The providers of these tools are the independent controllers of the data collected in them and may share these data under the terms and conditions they set forth in their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, over which we have no control.</p><p>Yes, part of the processing of your personal data may involve their transfer to third countries.</p><p>We transfer your personal data to third countries in connection with the use of tools that store personal data on servers located in third countries, in particular in the USA. The same may be true for Anonymous Information. The providers of these tools guarantee an adequate level of protection of personal data through appropriate compliance mechanisms provided for by the GDPR, in particular through the use of standard contractual clauses.</p><p>Currently, your data are transferred in connection with our use of the following solutions:</p></div><div><div id=\"w-node-b688b407-ed0e-a2c4-0004-251111e53a3c-78f849e2\"><div id=\"w-node-b688b407-ed0e-a2c4-0004-251111e53a3d-78f849e2\"><p>Google tools, including YouTube</p></div><div><p>1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043</p></div></div><div><p>410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109-5210, United States, Data center in Frankfurt</p></div><div><p>One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052-6399 United States, Data center in the Netherlands</p></div><div><p>One Front Street, 1 Front St #28th, San Francisco, USA</p></div><div><p>450 Artisan Way, Somerville, MA 02145, USA</p></div></div><div><p>In addition, your personal data may be transferred to third countries in connection with the use of cookies.

We understand this perfectly well, so we present you a document in which you will find in one place the rules for the processing of personal data and the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.This Privacy Policy applies to the information system called Calendesk, which we will hereafter refer to as \"Calendesk\".To begin with, the controller of your personal data is MPR Sp\u00f3\u0142ka z ograniczon\u0105 odpowiedzialno\u015bci\u0105, with its registered office in Warsaw at 6 Floria\u0144ska Street, premises 02, 03-707 Warsaw, entered into the National Court Register by the District Court for the Capital City of Warsaw in Warsaw, XII Commercial Division of the National Court Register, National Court Register number (KRS number): 0000788188, TIN number: PL5783137225.We process your personal data primarily for purposes related to your use of Calendesk, such as the maintenance of your user account, the handling of contracts relating to the use of Calendesk, the processing of complaints and withdrawals, the fulfilment of tax obligations, matters relating to claims, marketing, etc. We process your personal data for the period of time necessary for the respective purpose. You have the right to access, rectify, erase or restrict the processing of your personal data, to object to the processing, as well as the right to transfer your data. In addition, you can lodge a complaint with the President of the Personal Data Protection Office.Please refer to the following section of the Privacy Policy for details on how your personal data will be processed.Who is the controller of your personal data?Who can you contact regarding the processing of your personal data?For what purposes do we process your personal data?What information do we have about you?What is \"Anonymous Information\"?Where do we get your personal data from?Are your data secure?How long will we store your personal data?Who are the recipients of your personal data?Do we transfer your data to third countries or international organizations?Do we use profiling?

It is the entity alone that decides the purposes and means of processing personal data within the framework of the contract they enter into, and it is also the entity alone that is responsible for complying with all obligations from the GDPR, including providing information about the principles of personal data processing. In such a situation, we act as a processor who provides such a service provider with the appropriate IT tool.As part of the implementation of personal data protection in our company, we have decided not to appoint a data protection officer due to the fact that in our case it is not mandatory. For matters related to personal data protection and broadly understood privacy, you can contact us at support@calendesk.com.There is more than one such purpose. Below is a list of them followed by a more detailed discussion. We have also assigned the appropriate legal grounds for processing to the individual purposes.When you create a user account, you must provide the data necessary to set up the account, namely your email address and password. The provision of the data is voluntary, but necessary for the creation of the account.Within the framework of editing your account data, you can provide further data, in particular data that can be used for the conclusion of a contract, such as your name, business address, TIN number, telephone number.In addition, our system used for user accounts records your IP number, which you used when registering your user account, as well as the date your account was created and the validity of your access within Calendesk (if the access is temporary).You can modify the information about yourself provided to us in connection with user account registration at any time.The data provided by you in connection with the creation of your account are processed in order to provide you with the electronic service consisting in providing you with the possibility of using the user account.Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPRConclusion and operation of the contractIf you wish to enter into a contract with us for the use of Calendesk, you have to provide us with the data necessary for the contract to be fulfilled, i.e. email address, telephone number, name and surname, invoice details (in the case of paid services). In addition, the system used to operate Calendesk saves your IP number, which you used when concluding the contract.Each conclusion of a contract is recorded in a database, which means that your personal data assigned to your user account are also accompanied by information relating to the conclusion of the contract, such as, for instance, the date and time of conclusion of the contract, the contract identification number and, in the case of payment of fees to us, also data relating to the payments made.In connection with the conclusion of a contract, we also process your personal data in order to perform the services provided for in the concluded contract. The extent of these data depends on which personal data are needed to perform the contract.Where we receive your data in the performance of a contract, e.g. from an entity that employs you, we base such processing on a legitimate interest, which in this case is to ensure the efficient and effective handling of the contract concluded. In this case, we may process your identifying and contact data.Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPRHandling complaints and withdrawalsIf you make a complaint or withdraw from a contract, you provide personal data in the body of the complaint or withdrawal statement, which includes your name and surname, company, business address, TIN, telephone number, email address, bank account number. The provision of data is voluntary, but necessary to make a complaint or withdraw from the contract.Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR, Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPRFulfilment of tax and accounting obligationsIn connection with the performance of the contract, we also fulfil various tax and accounting obligations, in particular the issuing of an invoice, the inclusion of the invoice in our accounting records, the retention of records, etc. In order to issue an invoice, we process data such as name and surname, company, business address, TIN, among others. The provision of data required by tax law is necessary to fulfil the obligations indicated.Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR in compliance with the relevant tax law provisionsWe may create archives for the purposes of our business: both in traditional and digital form. The archives include any personal data that we have processed in connection with you, therefore the scope of the archives may vary depending on what data have been obtained. In this case, we rely on our legitimate interest in organising and structuring the personal data carriers.Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPRDefence against claims, establishment of claims, or redressThe use of Calendesk, as well as the conclusion of a contract with us, may give rise to certain claims on our part or yours in the future. Accordingly, we are entitled to process your personal data for the purpose of defending or establishing a claim, or seeking redress. As part of this purpose, we may process any personal data that are related to the claim in question, so the extent of the processing may vary depending on what the claim relates to. In this case, we rely on our legitimate interest to protect our interests in this regard.Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPRContact and correspondenceWhen you contact us via the available means of communication, e.g. email, social messaging, chat rooms, etc., you naturally provide your personal data contained in the content of your correspondence, in particular your email address and your name and surname. The provision of data is voluntary, but necessary in order to establish contact and to handle our correspondence. In this case, we are relying on our legitimate interest in providing a means of contact.Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPRIf you follow our social media profiles or interact with content that we publish on social media, we naturally see your data that are publicly available in your social media profile.

Within the analytical tools, we have access to both Anonymous Information and information that can be attributed to specific users. Using these tools, we track the activity of our users, their behaviour on the website, the choices they make, etc. We base the processing of Anonymous Information on our legitimate interest in creating, viewing, and analyzing statistics related to user activity on the website in order to draw conclusions for the subsequent optimisation of the website.For details on the tools of external providers, please see the section on the tools we use.Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPROwn marketing using only Anonymous InformationWe carry out marketing activities using tools provided by external providers. Within the marketing tools, we only have access to Anonymous Information.

Accordingly, we may process your personal data insofar as it is necessary to comply with these obligations (e.g. when processing your request for your personal data). The extent of the data depends on what data we need to fulfil the obligation and prove compliance with the GDPR.In addition, in this case we also rely on our legitimate interest in securing the data necessary to demonstrate accountability.Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR, Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPRFulfilment of obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA)As an intermediary service provider, we are obliged to fulfil our obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA), such as receiving and dealing with notifications regarding User Content, receiving and dealing with appeals regarding decisions made by us in relation to the User Content, providing certain information about the user upon the receipt of a warrant issued by authorised institutions or authorities, and notifying law enforcement or judicial authorities of a suspected offence endangering the life or safety of a person or persons in connection with the use of the service. For these purposes, we process personal data to the extent that is necessary to comply with the obligations provided for by law.Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR in conjunction with the relevant DSA regulationsWhen submitting User Content (as defined in our Terms and Conditions), e.g. a comment or an opinion, you must provide the personal data necessary for this purpose.The provision of data is a condition for the transmission of the User Content.In addition, our ICT system records your IP number that you used when transmitting the User Content.The ICT system that handles the User Content may be operated by an external provider. If so, your use of the system is subject to the Terms and Conditions and the privacy policy of the third-party provider.

Nevertheless, given the strict jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the divided opinions among lawyers, as a precaution, in case Anonymous Information is attributed the character of personal data, we have also included detailed explanations in the Privacy Policy regarding the processing of this information.The processing of Anonymous Information allows us to provide you with the functionality available within Calendesk. In addition, Anonymous Information is used for analytical and statistical as well as marketing purposes (e.g. creating Custom Audiences on Facebook, setting, targeting and directing advertisements).Anonymous Information is also processed by tool providers under the terms of their Terms of Conditions and Privacy Policies. It may be used by these providers to provide, improve and manage services, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertisements, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalise the content and advertisements displayed on individual services, websites, and applications. Please see the section on the tools we use for more detailed information.In most cases, you provide them to us yourself. For example, this is the case when you register a user account, conclude a contract, send a complaint or withdraw from a contract, contact us via email or chat, or use the functionalities available within Calendesk or external services (e.g. social networks).In addition, some information about you may be automatically collected by tools we use.

We constantly monitor the state of our technical infrastructure, train our staff, observe the procedures applied, and make necessary improvements.We process your personal data for as long as it is justified within the framework of a given purpose for processing your personal data, and therefore processing periods vary depending on the purpose. Please note that the termination of the processing of your data for one purpose does not necessarily lead to the complete erasure or destruction of your personal data since the same set of data may be processed for another purpose, for the period of time indicated for that purpose. Complete erasure or destruction of data occurs when all purposes have been completed and in other cases indicated in the GDPR.Below you will find a description of the processing periods:User account \u2013 data related to the user account are processed for the duration of the user account;Conclusion and handling of the contract \u2013 contract-related data are processed for the time necessary to conclude and perform the contract;Complaints and withdrawals \u2013 data related to complaints and withdrawals are processed for the time necessary to handle the complaint or withdrawal;Contact and correspondence \u2013 data related to correspondence handling will be processed for the duration of the contact between us;Tax and accounting obligations \u2013 data related to the fulfilment of tax and accounting obligations will be processed for the time prescribed by tax law, usually 5 years after the end of the tax year;Archive \u2013 data related to the archive will be processed until the information contained in the archive is no longer relevant;Defence against claims, establishment of claims, and redress \u2013 data related to claims will be processed until the claims are time-barred, and the period of limitation for claims may vary in light of the applicable legislation (e.g. for businesses the standard period is 3 years);Social media \u2013 data related to social media audience will be processed until you opt out of interacting with us on social media;Analysis and statistics \u2013 data related to analytics and statistics will be processed until they are no longer useful or until you effectively object;Own marketing \u2013 data related to own marketing will be processed until they become obsolete or until you effectively object;Ancillary tools \u2013 data related to ancillary tools will be processed until they are no longer useful or you effectively object;Data protection obligations \u2013 data related to the protection of personal data will be processed until the expiry of their relevance, your effective objection, or the expiry of the limitation period for our liability as a personal data controller;DSA related obligations \u2013 data relating to ensuring DSA compliance shall be processed until the expiry of the statute of limitations on our liability as an intermediary service provider;Storage of User Content \u2014 data relating to the storage of User Content shall be stored until the User Content is removed.In the event that we process your personal data on the basis of consent you have given, you can withdraw such consent at any time: either by your action or by contacting us using the contact details provided.

The providers of these tools are the independent controllers of the data collected in them and may share these data under the terms and conditions they set forth in their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, over which we have no control.Yes, part of the processing of your personal data may involve their transfer to third countries.We transfer your personal data to third countries in connection with the use of tools that store personal data on servers located in third countries, in particular in the USA.

We do use tools that can take specific actions depending on the information collected as part of the tracking mechanisms but we believe that these actions do not have a significant impact on you for they do not differentiate your situation as a customer, they do not affect the terms of the contract you can enter into with us, etc.Using certain tools, we may, for example, target personalised advertisements to you based on previous actions taken by you within Calendesk. This is called behavioural advertising. We encourage you to learn more about behavioural advertising, particularly with regard to privacy issues.
