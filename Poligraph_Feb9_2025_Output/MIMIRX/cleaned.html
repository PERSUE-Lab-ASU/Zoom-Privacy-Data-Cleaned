        How We Secure Information
      </div>
      <p>MIMI-Rx Registry implements measures and systems to ensure confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of MIMI-Rx Registry data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
      <strong> De-identification/Pseudonymization, encryption, and data
segmentation.</strong> Registration Information is stripped from Sensitive Information,
including genetic and phenotypic data. This data is then assigned a random ID so
the person who provided the data cannot reasonably be identified. MIMI-Rx
Registry uses industry standard security measures to encrypt sensitive personal
data both when it is stored (data-at-rest) and when it is being transmitted (data-inflight). Additionally, data are segmented across logical database systems to further
prevent re-identifiability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limiting access to essential personnel.</strong> We limit access of information to
authorized personnel, based on job function and role. MIMI-Rx Registry access
controls include multi-factor authentication, single sign-on, and a strict leastprivileged authorization policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Detecting threats and managing vulnerabilities.</strong> MIMI-Rx Registry uses state of
the art intrusion detection and prevention measures to stop any potential attacks
against its networks. We have integrated continuous vulnerability scanning in our
build pipeline and regularly engage third party security experts to conduct
penetration tests.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="zoom-marketplace-content-subtitle">
        Risks and Considerations
      </div>
      <p>
        There may be some consequences of using MIMI-Rx Registry that you haven't
considered.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may discover things about yourself and/or your family members that may be
upsetting or cause anxiety and that you may not have the ability to control or
change.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may discover relatives who were previously unknown to you, or may learn that
someone you thought you were related to is not your biological relative.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the event of a data breach it is possible that your data could be associated with
your identity, which could be used against your interests.

          <strong>To recruit you for external research</strong>
          <p>Research is an important aspect of MIMI-RX Registry’s Services and we want to
ensure interested participants are aware of additional opportunities to contribute to
interesting, novel scientific research conducted by academic institutions, healthcare
organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and other groups. If you have chosen to
participate in MIMI-RX Registry Research, from time to time we may inform you of
third party research opportunities for which you may be eligible. For example, if a
university tells us about a new cancer research project, we may send an email to
MIMI-RX Registry research participants who potentially fit the relevant eligibility
criteria based on their Self-Reported Information to make them aware of the
research project and provide a link to participate with the research organization
conducting the study. However we will not share Individual-level Genetic
Information or Self-Reported Information with any third party without your consent.
If you do not wish to receive these notifications, you can manage them by editing
your preferences in your Account Settings.</p>

          <strong>To provide customer support</strong>
          <p>When you contact Customer Care, we may use or request Personal Information,
including Sensitive Information, as necessary to answer your questions, resolve

behavior that violates our Terms of Service, we will separately process both
customers’ Personal Information and respond separately to each individual as
appropriate. We will not share your Personal Information with another customer
without your consent.</p>
<p>For individuals located in the Designated Countries: Our legal basis for processing
your Personal Information for the purpose described above depends on the nature

      </div>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>General service providers.</strong>
          <p>Service providers are third parties (other companies or individuals) that help us to
provide, analyze and improve our Services. While MIMI-RX Registry directly
conducts the majority of data processing activities required to provide our Services
to you, we engage some third party service providers to assist in supporting our
Services, including in the following areas:</p>
          <ol type="i">
            <li><strong>Customer Care support.</strong> Our Customer Care team uses a number of tools to
help organize and manage the requests we receive. These tools help to ensure
we provide timely, high quality support.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud storage, IT, and Security.</strong> Our cloud storage providers provide secure
storage for information in MIMI-RX Registry databases, ensure that our
infrastructure can support continued use of our Services by MIMI-RX Registry
customers, and protect data in the event of a natural disaster or other disruption
to the Service. Our IT and security providers assist with intrusion detection and
prevention measures to stop any potential attacks against our networks. We
have these third party experts perform regular penetration tests and periodically
audit MIMI-RX Registry’s security controls.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing and analytics.</strong>. When you use our Services, including our website or
mobile app(s), our third party service providers may collect Web-Behavior
Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of
your visit, and the URLs you visited. This information can help us improve site
navigability and assess our Marketing campaigns. Per applicable data
protection regulations, our EU, UK, and International websites present visitors
with a cookie opt in to allow the processing described above via Functionality
and Advertising Cookies.
<p>NOTE: Our service providers act on MIMI-RX Registry's behalf. We implement
procedures and maintain contractual terms with each service provider to protect
the confidentiality and security of your information. However, we cannot
guarantee the confidentiality and security of your information due to the
inherent risks associated with storing and transmitting data electronically.</p></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Aggregate information</strong>
        <p>
          We may share Aggregate Information, which is information that has been stripped
of your name and contact information and combined with information of others so
that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual, with third parties. This
Information is different from "Individual-level" information and is not Personal
Information because it does not identify any particular individual or disclose any
particular individual’s data. For example, Aggregate Information may include a
statement that "30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait," without
providing any data or testing results specific to any individual user. In contrast,
Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information consists of data
about a single individual's genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics
information and could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or
consist of all of the Genetic Information about that user. MIMI-RX Registry will ask
for your consent to share Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported
Information with any third party, other than our service providers as necessary for
us to provide the Services to you.
        </p>
      </li>
        <li><strong>Information we share with commonly owned entities</strong>
        <p>
          We may share some or all of your Personal Information with other companies under
common ownership or control of MIMI-RX Registry, which may include our
subsidiaries, our corporate parent, or any other subsidiaries owned by our
corporate parent in order to provide you better service and improve user
experience. Generally, sharing such information is necessary for us to perform on
our contract with you. We may provide additional notice and ask for your prior
consent if we wish to share your Personal Information with our commonly owned
entities in a materially different way than discussed in this Privacy Statement.
        </p></li>
        <li><strong>As required by law</strong>
          <p>
            Under certain circumstances your Personal Information may be subject to
processing pursuant to laws, regulations, judicial or other government subpoenas,
warrants, or orders. For example, we may be required to disclose Personal
Information in coordination with regulatory authorities in response to lawful requests
by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement
requirements. MIMI-RX Registry will preserve and disclose any and all information
to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good
faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a)
comply with legal or regulatory process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order,
or government inquiry) or obligations that MIMI-RX Registry may owe pursuant to
ethical and other professional rules, laws, and regulations; (b) enforce the MIMI-RX
Registry Terms of Service and other policies; (c) respond to claims that any content
violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal
safety of MIMI-RX Registry, its employees, its users, its clients, and the public. View
our Transparency Report for more information.
          </p>
          <p>
            NOTE: If you are participating in MIMI-RX Registry Research, MIMI-RX Registry will
withhold disclosure of your Personal Information involved in such Research in
response to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders in
accordance with any applicable Certificate of Confidentiality that MIMI-RX Registry
has obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). There are limits to what
the Certificate of Confidentiality covers so please visit the Certificates of
Confidentiality Kiosk.

        <li><strong>Business transactions</strong>
        <p>In the event that MIMI-RX Registry goes through a business transition such as a
merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets your
Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. In such a case,
your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing
Privacy Statement.</p></li>

      </div>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>Access to your account</strong>
        <p>
          We provide access to your MIMI-RX Registry data within your MIMI-RX Registry
account. You can access and download data processed by MIMI-RX Registry within
your Account Settings and within applicable Reports, Tools, and features. If you
lose access to your MIMI-RX Registry account or account email address, please
contact Customer Care for assistance. If you lose access to your MIMI-RX Registry
account, in certain circumstances, we may require that you submit additional
information sufficient to verify your identity before providing access or otherwise
releasing information to you. If you choose not to submit the required
documentation, or the information provided is not sufficient for the purposes sought,
MIMI-RX Registry will not be able to sufficiently verify your identity in order to
complete your request.
        </p>
      <p>
        You may access, correct or update most of your Registration Information on your
own within your Account Settings. You may also review and update your consent to
MIMI-RX Registry Research and Biobanking. You may be able to correct SelfReported Information entered into a survey, form, or feature within your account,
such as on the surveys page, by clicking “Edit your answers here.” Please note that
you may not be able to delete User Content that has been shared with others
through the Service and that you may not be able to delete information that has
been shared with third parties.
      </p>
    <p>
      Individuals located in Designated Countries should review Section 8.e. to
understand their rights to access Personal Information.
    </p></li>
        <li><strong>Marketing communications</strong>
        <p>
          As noted in Section 3.h. you may be asked to opt-in to receive product and
promotional emails or notifications when creating your MIMI-RX Registry account
depending on where you are located. Otherwise, you may view or update your
email notification preferences by visiting your Account Settings or by contacting our
Privacy Administrator at MIMIRx@TheEagleForce.net. You can also click the
"unsubscribe" button at the bottom of promotional email communications.
        </p></li>
        <li><strong>Sharing outside of the MIMI-RX Registry Services</strong>
        <p>
          You may decide to share your Personal Information with friends and/or family
members, doctors or other health care professionals, and/or other individuals
outside of our Services, including through third party services such as social
networks and third party apps that connect to our website and mobile apps through
our application programming interface ("API"). These third parties may use your
Personal Information differently than we do under this Privacy Statement. Please
make such choices carefully and review the privacy statements of all other third
parties involved in the transaction. MIMI-RX Registry does not endorse or sponsor
any API applications, and does not affirm the accuracy or validity of any
interpretations made by third party API applications.
        </p>
      <p>
        In general, it can be difficult to contain or retrieve Personal Information once it has
been shared or disclosed. MIMI-RX Registry will have no responsibility or liability for
any consequences that may result because you have released or shared Personal
Information with others. Likewise, if you are reading this because you have access
to the Personal Information of a MIMI-RX Registry customer through a multi-profile
account, we urge you to recognize your responsibility to protect the privacy of each
person within that account. Users with multi-profile accounts (i.e., where multiple
family members register their kits to one account) should use caution in setting
profile-level privacy settings.
      </p></li>
        <li><strong>Account deletion</strong>
        <p>
          If you no longer wish to participate in our Services, or no longer wish to have your
Personal Information be processed, you may delete your MIMI-RX Registry account
and Personal Information within your Account Settings. Once you submit your
request, we will send an email to the email address linked to your MIMI-RX Registry
account detailing our account deletion policy and requesting that you to confirm
your deletion request. Once you confirm your request to delete your account and
data, your account will no longer be accessible while we process your request.
Once you confirm your request, this process cannot be cancelled, undone,
withdrawn, or reversed. When your account is deleted, all associated Personal
Information is deleted and any stored samples are discarded, subject to the
following limitations:
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            Information previously included in MIMI-RX Registry Research. As stated in any
applicable Consent Document, Genetic Information and/or Self-Reported Information
that you have previously provided and for which you have given consent to use in MIMIRX Registry Research cannot be removed from completed studies that use that
information. Your data will not be included in studies that start more than 30 days after
your account is closed (it may take up to 30 days to withdraw your information after your
account is closed).
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal Retention Requirements. MIMI-RX Registry and our third party
genotyping laboratory will retain your Genetic Information, date of birth, and sex
as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations, including the
federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and CA
Business and Professional Code Section 1265 and CAP accreditation
requirements. MIMI-RX Registry will also retain limited information related to
your account and data deletion request, including but not limited to, your email

           6. Security measures
      </div>
      <p>
        MIMI-RX Registry takes seriously the trust you place in us. MIMI-RX Registry
implements physical, technical, and administrative measures to prevent unauthorized
access to or disclosure of your information, to maintain data accuracy, to ensure the
appropriate use of information, and otherwise safeguard your Personal Information.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MIMI-RX Registry produces secure applications by design.</strong>MIMI-RX Registry
incorporates explicit security reviews in the software development lifecycle, quality
assurance testing and operational deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>De-identification/Pseudonymization.</strong>. Registration Information is stripped from
Sensitive Information, including Genetic and Self-Reported Information. This data is
then assigned a randomly generated ID so an individual cannot reasonably be
identified.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption.</strong>MIMI-RX Registry uses industry standard security measures to encrypt
Sensitive Information both at rest and in transit.</li>
        <li><strong>Separation of Environments.</strong>MIMI-RX Registry ensures processing, production,
and research environments are separated and access is restricted. Data, including
Registration Information, Genetic Information, and Self-Reported Information are
segmented across logical database systems to further prevent re-identifiability.</li>
        <li><strong>Limiting access to essential personnel.</strong>We limit access to Personal Information
to authorized personnel, based on job function and role. MIMI-RX Registry access
controls include multi-factor authentication, single sign-on, and strict least-privileged
authorization policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Detecting threats and managing vulnerabilities.</strong>MIMI-RX Registry uses state of
the art intrusion detection and prevention measures to stop any potential attacks
against its networks. We have integrated continuous vulnerability scanning in our
processes and regularly engage third party security experts to conduct penetration
tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Incident Management.</strong>MIMI-RX Registry maintains a formal incident management
program designed to ensure the secure, continuous delivery of its Services. MIMIRX Registry has implemented an incident management program using industry best
practices, including guidance from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST).</li>
        <li><strong>Managing third party service providers.</strong>MIMI-RX Registry requires service
providers to implement and maintain accepted industry standard administrative,
physical and technical safeguards to protect Personal Information.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Your Responsibility.</strong> Please recognize that protecting your Personal Information is
also your responsibility. We ask you to be responsible for safeguarding your password,
secret questions and answers, and other authentication information you use to access
our Services. You should not disclose your authentication information to any third party
and should immediately notify MIMI-RX Registry of any unauthorized use of your
password. MIMI-RX Registry cannot secure Personal Information that you release on
your own or that you request us to release.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the
United States or any other country in which MIMI-RX Registry or its subsidiaries,
affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and, therefore, your information may be
subject to the laws of those other jurisdictions which may be different from the laws of
your country of residence.

        MIMI-RX Registry provides links to third party websites operated by organizations not

organizations operating such linked third party websites. MIMI-RX Registry does not

      <ol type="i">
        <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent.</strong>
          To the extent MIMI-RX Registry requests and you provide
  your consent to the processing of your Personal Information, you can withdraw your
  consent at any time. Your withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of our processing
  based on consent before your withdrawal.</li>
        <li><strong>Right of access to and rectification of your Personal Information.</strong>. Our site
allows you to access and rectify certain Registration Information within your
Account Settings, and your Self-Reported Information by going to the surveys
page. You can download your raw Genetic Information within your Account
Settings or by going to the applicable tool in “Tools.” If you would like to access
or rectify any other information, contact Customer Care and we will do our best
to assist you without undue delay. We may reject part or all of your request if
responding to your request could adversely affect the rights and freedoms of
others.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to erasure (or, “Right to be Forgotten”).</strong>As explained under Section
5.d. (“Account Deletion”), we allow our customers to delete their accounts at
any time. You can request erasure of Personal Information that: (a) is no longer
necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise
processed; (b) was collected in relation to processing to which you previously
consented, but later withdrew such consent; or (c) was collected in relation to
processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate
grounds for our processing. If we have made your Personal Information public
and we are required to erase such Personal Information, we will take
reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers that are
processing any links to or copies or replications of your Personal Information of
your erasure request. Our assistance with your request for erasure is subject to
limitations by relevant data protection laws, available technology and the cost of
implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to data portability.</strong>If we process your Personal Information based on a
contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by
automated means, you may request to receive your Personal Information in a
structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us
transfer your Personal Information directly to another controller, where
technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and
freedoms of others. A “controller” is a natural or legal person, public authority,
agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
purposes and means of the processing of your Personal Information.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to restriction of our processing.</strong>You can restrict our processing of
your Personal Information where one of the following applies: (a) you dispute
the accuracy of Personal Information processed by MIMI-RX Registry (for a
period enabling us to verify its accuracy); (b) the processing is unlawful and you
oppose the erasure of the Personal Information and request the restriction of its
use instead; (c) MIMI-RX Registry no longer needs the Personal Information for
the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you for the establishment,
exercise or defense of legal claims; and (d) you have objected to certain
processing relying on legitimate interest, pending the verification whether MIMIRX Registry’s legitimate grounds override your rights. Restricted Personal
Information shall only be processed with your consent or for the establishment,
exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another
natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will notify
you if the restriction is lifted.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification of erasure, rectification and restriction.</strong>We will provide notice
to each recipient that we disclosed your Personal Information to regarding any
rectification or erasure of Personal Information or restriction of processing,
unless you initiated the disclosure or providing notice proves impossible or
involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will share the list of
recipients with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to object to processing.</strong>Where the processing of your Personal
Information is based on consent, contract, or legitimate interests described
under the Legal Bases for Processing heading above, you may restrict or
object, at any time, to the processing of your Personal Information as permitted
by applicable law. We may continue to process your Personal Information if it is
necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted
by applicable law.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated individual decision-making, including profiling.</strong>You have the
right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing,
including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you,
except as allowed under applicable data protection laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention of your Personal Information.</strong>. Unless you make a request for us to
delete your account or delete certain Personal Information (i.e., User Content,
etc.), we will store your Personal Information as long as your account is open. If
you request to delete your account, we will take the steps described under
“Your Choices – Account Deletion” and delete all your Personal Information,
unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The rights described above may be limited by local laws. Further, your right of
access and deletion is not absolute and may not be available if fulfillment of such
right would, among other things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>cause interference with execution and enforcement of the law and legal private
rights (such as in the case of the investigation or detection of legal claims or the
right to a fair trial);</li>
        <li>breach or prejudice the rights of confidentiality and security of others;</li>
        <li>prejudice security or grievance investigations, corporate re-organizations, future
and ongoing negotiations with third parties, the compliance with regulatory
requirements relating to economic and financial management; or</li>
        <li>otherwise violate the interests of others or where the burden or cost of
providing access would be disproportionate.</li>
