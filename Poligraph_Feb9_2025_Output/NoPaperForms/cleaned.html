                    tracking software. The capture of

                    visited,
                    and length of user session. We use this information to measure the effectiveness of the Website

                <p>The app asks the user’s consent for recording their location. If the user chooses to allow it, the
                    app captures their location when they check in and check out on the app. The location is captured
                    every 30 minutes
                    while the app is running in the background. This is done for partners to
                    know when and where their field agents are spending their working
                    hours. It stops when the user has checked out in the app. All of this
                    happens only if the partner institution has requested for this feature. It is disabled by default.
                </p>


                <p>This information is exclusively shared with our partners who have
                    requested it and will be used only for mapping user locations. Users may
