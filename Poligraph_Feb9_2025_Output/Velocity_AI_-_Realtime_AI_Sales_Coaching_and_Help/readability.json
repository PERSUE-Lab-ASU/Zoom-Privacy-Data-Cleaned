Privacy Policy for Velocity AI</strong></h2><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Revenue Velocity Inc. (\"Revenue Velocity\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") offers the Velocity AI app (\"Velocity AI\", \"App\"), a service that connects to your Zoom calls and Microsoft Teams calls, transcribes conversations, and provides relevant information from company sales methodology and other company information. This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect through our App, how we use and protect that information, and the choices you can make about how we use this information.</p><h2><strong>1. Data Collection and Usage</strong></h2><p>Our App collects information in a few different ways:</p><h3><strong>1.1 Google OAuth Access Data</strong></h3><p>Velocity AI connects to your Google Account via OAuth and requests access to certain scopes for enhanced functionality. The scopes we request access to include:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>Primary Email Address</strong>: Your primary Google Account email address is used for identification and direct communication purposes.</li><li><strong>Personal Info</strong>: This includes any personal info you've made publicly available on your Google profile. We use this information to customize the user experience.</li><li><strong>Google Calendar (Read-only)</strong>: The App has read-only access to any of your calendars accessible via Google Calendar. This is used for scheduling features within the App, such as scheduling bots for upcoming calls.</li></ul><p>We ensure that all Google user data accessed through OAuth is used strictly within the bounds of the granted permissions and only to enhance app functionality. No Google user data is shared with third parties without explicit user consent, which is clearly obtained through an affirmative action in our consent process (detailed in Section 2, Consent). All data is secured during transmission to and from our servers.</p><h3><strong>1.2 Zoom OAuth Access Data</strong></h3><p>Velocity AI connects to your Zoom account via OAuth and requires certain permissions to provide its services effectively. Below are the Zoom scopes we request access to and why we need them:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>zoomapp:inmeeting</strong>: This scope is essential for Velocity AI's operation as it enables the app to provide suggestions directly within the Zoom client. This ability is at the heart of Velocity AI's functionality, enabling it to deliver real-time support and coaching efficiently during your Zoom meetings.</li><li><strong>user:read</strong>: Velocity AI requires this scope to uphold data privacy and security standards. This scope allows the app to authenticate user identities and permissions, ensuring that the real-time support is delivered only to authorized users during a Zoom meeting.</li><li><strong>meeting:read</strong>: This scope is critical for Velocity AI's functionality. It permits the app to accurately identify each meeting participant. This ability allows Velocity AI to make relevant suggestions based on the conversation context and each participant's role within the call.</li><li><strong>meeting:write</strong>: This scope is vital for Velocity AI to provide a seamless user experience. By having this permission, Velocity AI can automatically fetch information about the meeting lifecycle events like when a meeting is created or started. As a result, users don't need to manually input this information, making the app more intuitive and user-friendly.</li><li><strong>meeting_token:read:local_recording</strong>: This scope is pivotal for Velocity AI to access and process the real-time audio stream from your Zoom meetings. The obtained local recording meeting tokens are used to power Velocity AI's transcription feature. As a result, Velocity AI can listen in real-time, transcribe the conversation, and generate contextually relevant suggestions during your Zoom meetings. This scope is critical for the fundamental functionality of the Velocity AI app.</li></ul><h3><strong>1.3 Real-Time Zoom Streaming Data</strong></h3><p>Velocity AI captures and processes the real-time streaming data of your Zoom calls to provide its core functionality. Here's why this data capture is necessary:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li><strong>Real-Time Support</strong>: Velocity AI uses the real-time audio and video streams of your Zoom calls to generate on-the-spot suggestions and coaching. The app listens to the conversations, identifies relevant questions or topics, and provides immediate responses based on the company's specific sales methodology. This real-time processing allows for efficient and timely communication during your Zoom meetings.</li><li><strong>Contextual Information</strong>: Capturing real-time streaming data enables Velocity AI to understand the context of the ongoing conversation. This contextual understanding is paramount in delivering accurate and relevant responses to the participants, contributing to a more productive and engaging meeting experience.</li><li><strong>User Experience Personalization</strong>: The real-time streaming data helps Velocity AI adapt to the dynamics of the conversation. It allows the app to adjust the nature and timing of its responses according to the flow of the meeting, enhancing the overall user experience.</li></ul><h3><strong>1.4 Application Use Data</strong></h3><p>As part of the regular operation of Velocity AI, we collect standard application use data to improve your experience, secure your interactions, and streamline our service.
