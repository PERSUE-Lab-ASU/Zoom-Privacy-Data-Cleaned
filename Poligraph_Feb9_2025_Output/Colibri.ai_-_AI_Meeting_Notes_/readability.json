In connection with\n            certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information.\n            We collect the following types of information from our users. </p>\n\n        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong></p>\n        <p>When you create an Account, you may provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your\n            username, password and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account\n            on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and\n            therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you messages about our Services. You may\n            unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings or by clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the\n            bottom of marketing emails, although we, regardless, reserve the right to continue sending you non-marketing emails,\n            such as emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you. </p>\n        <p>The Services may allow users to log in and create an Account through your Facebook, Google, Zoom or\n            similar account (each a \"Third Party Account\") using your respective ID. If you log in to the Services through your Third\n            Party Account, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the Third Party\n            Account\u2019s terms of use in your use of the Services. We may receive information from such Third Party Accounts and\n            that information may be imported to the Services (either as a part of your profile or otherwise). We will use all\n            information available through a Third Party Account in accordance with the Third Party Account\u2019s policies and your\n            account privacy settings selected through the Third Party Account, so please consult such policies and\n            settings. </p>\n        <p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of your Third Party Account and that it is\n            your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of each Third Party Account.

Before you do\n            so, please make sure you have the necessary permissions from your co-workers, friends or other third parties\n            before sharing Personal Information or referring them to us.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Information Collected from Other Sources:</strong></p>\n        <p>We may receive your information from services you integrate with Colibri. If you provide third-party account\n            credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (\"Third Party Account\n            Information\") will be transmitted into your Colibri account, and that Third Party Account Information\n            transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>\n        <p>Further, our products may request permissions to take actions on your behalf using your third-party account\n            credentials. For example, if you choose to integrate Colibri products with your Zoom or Slack account, Colibri\n            products will request authority to read incoming messages and send emails on your behalf. </p>\n\n        <p><strong>Financial Information:</strong></p>\n        <p>We do not collect financial information.

This information is generally used to help us deliver\n                the most relevant information to you and administer and improve the Services. In addition, in the event our\n                Application crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software\n                version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of\n                our Application.\n            </li>\n            <li>We may gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, including IP addresses, browser type,\n                Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\n                We use this information to improve the content of the Services, market research purposes, to communicate\n                information to visitors and to better tailor our Services to our users\u2019 needs.\n            </li>\n            <li>We use third party analytics services to help analyze how users use the Services. These analytics services use\n                Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Services and we use the information to\n                improve our Services and Services. The analytics services\u2019 ability to use and share information collected by them is\n                restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how\n                these entities use this information.\n            </li>\n            <li>We may collect and create anonymous and/or deidentified data records about how both unregistered and\n                registered users, collectively, use the Services (\"Aggregate Information\"), such as the number and frequency of visitors to\n                the Site or Application. Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. We reserve the right to\n                use Aggregate Information for any purpose and disclose it to third parties in our sole discretion. This\n                Aggregate Information is not Personal Information and we use reasonable efforts to ensure that it cannot be tied\n                back to you, your Account, your web browser or mobile device. We use this anonymous data to enhance the content\n                of our Services and improve the Services, for example by allowing us and third parties authorized by us to\n                figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p><strong>Email Communications:</strong></p>\n        <p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.

We use cookies to enable our servers to\n                recognize your web browser or mobile device and tell us how and when you use the Services.\n            </li>\n            <li>Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information\n                collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use\n                cookies to identify that your web browser or mobile device has accessed aspects of the Services and may\n                associate that information with your Account if you have one.\n            </li>\n            <li>Most browsers or mobile devices have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your\n                browser or mobile device from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your\n                browser or mobile device software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We\n                strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they may enable you to take advantage of some features\n                of the Services.\n            </li>\n            <li>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.

As a result, some of the information\n            generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties. </p>\n\n        <p><strong>Public Information about Your Activity on the Services:</strong></p>\n        <p>Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to,\n            content you have posted publicly on the Site or Application or otherwise through the Services. </p>\n        <p>Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts. Unregistered users will not\n            have this association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be\n            tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us. </p>\n        <p>Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the\n            Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be\n            publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our\n            control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think\n            carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information\n            that you submit through the Services. </p>\n\n        <p><strong>IP Address Information:</strong></p>\n        <p>While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however,\n            share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and\n            as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy. </p>\n        <p>User Profile Information:</p>\n        <p>User profile information including your username and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to\n            facilitate user interaction within the Services. We will not directly reveal user email addresses to other\n            users. </p>\n        <p><strong>Financial Information:</strong></p>\n        <p>We do not collect financial information. </p>\n\n        <p><strong>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</strong></p>\n        <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one\n            of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go\n            out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by\n            a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue\n            to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may share your Personal\n            Information with our subsidiaries and affiliates. </p>\n\n        <p><strong>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:</strong></p>\n        <p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Personal Information as it reasonably\n            believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this\n            Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect,\n            prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v)\n            protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other\n            companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention. </p>\n\n        <p><strong>Information We Share With Your Consent:</strong></p>\n        <p>We may share your Personal Information to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it, for any other purpose\n            disclosed by us when you provide the information, with your consent, or to third parties designated by you. </p>\n        <h2>Is Information About Me Secure?</h2>\n        <p>Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent\n            unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately\n            and limiting access to your computer, phone, and browser or other device by signing off after you have finished\n            accessing your Account. </p>\n        <p>We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the\n            security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may\n            compromise the security of user information at any time. </p>\n        <p>We otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information, using industry-standard\n            techniques. We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the\n            integrity and security of Personal Information that we collect and maintain. While we use reasonable efforts\n            to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and we do not guarantee or\n            warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal\n            Information or otherwise.</p>\n        <h2>What Information of Mine Can I Access? </h2>\n        <p>If you are a registered user, you can access and edit information associated with your Account by logging into the\n            Services. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings. </p>\n\n        <p><strong>California Privacy Rights:</strong></p>\n        <p>Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice\n            identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties\n            for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.

Colibri.ai) (\"Colibri\",\n            \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\") regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the information of users of the Colibri website\n            located at http://colibri.ai (the \"Site\") and the services, features, products, content or applications we make\n            available, including the mobile application called \"Colibri\" (the \"Application\") (collectively with the Site, the\n            \"Services\"). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Services,\n            through your user account on the Services (your \"Account\"); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from\n            third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer,\n            manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. \n        What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?\n\n        This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (\"Personal Information\") gathered\n            when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal\n            Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners. Our business\n            partners include brands that make available through the Services their own products and services. \n        This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but\n            not limited to any business partner or other third party websites, services and applications (\"Third Party Services\")\n            that you elect to access through the Services. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Part\n            Services that share our respect for your privacy, we have no control over, do not review, and cannot take\n            responsibility for these Third Party Services, the content therein, or the privacy policies of those Third\n            Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access. \n\n        What Information Do We Collect and How is Such Information Used? \n        The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with\n            certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information.\n            We collect the following types of information from our users. \n\n        Account Information:\n        When you create an Account, you may provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your\n            username, password and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account\n            on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and\n            therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you messages about our Services. You may\n            unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings or by clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the\n            bottom of marketing emails, although we, regardless, reserve the right to continue sending you non-marketing emails,\n            such as emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you. \n        The Services may allow users to log in and create an Account through your Facebook, Google, Zoom or\n            similar account (each a \"Third Party Account\") using your respective ID. If you log in to the Services through your Third\n            Party Account, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the Third Party\n            Account\u2019s terms of use in your use of the Services. We may receive information from such Third Party Accounts and\n            that information may be imported to the Services (either as a part of your profile or otherwise). We will use all\n            information available through a Third Party Account in accordance with the Third Party Account\u2019s policies and your\n            account privacy settings selected through the Third Party Account, so please consult such policies and\n            settings. \n        You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of your Third Party Account and that it is\n            your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of each Third Party Account. We will not be liable\n            for: (i) the availability or accuracy of your Third Party Account; (ii) the content, products or services on or\n            available on your Third Party Account or (iii) your use of your Third Party Account. \n\n        Information you provide to us:\n        When you use the Services, you may provide us with your audio recordings (\"Audio Recordings\") and any text,\n            images or videos that you upload or provide to us in the context of the Services.\n        We also collect information that you include in your profile, such as your photo and birthday.\n\n        Information you provide us about others:\n        If you choose to collaborate on a task with your co-workers or friends, or refer us to them, you provide us\n            with the email address and contact information of your co-workers or friends.\n\n        If you provide an Audio Recording, this may contain the Personal Information of third parties. Before you do\n            so, please make sure you have the necessary permissions from your co-workers, friends or other third parties\n            before sharing Personal Information or referring them to us.\n\n        Information Collected from Other Sources:\n        We may receive your information from services you integrate with Colibri. If you provide third-party account\n            credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (\"Third Party Account\n            Information\") will be transmitted into your Colibri account, and that Third Party Account Information\n            transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.\n        Further, our products may request permissions to take actions on your behalf using your third-party account\n            credentials. For example, if you choose to integrate Colibri products with your Zoom or Slack account, Colibri\n            products will request authority to read incoming messages and send emails on your behalf. \n\n        Financial Information:\n        We do not collect financial information. However, we receive transaction information from our payment processor Square.\n\n        Other Information:\n        We may collect your phone number and the unique device ID number of the mobile device on which you use the\n            Application. \n        If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any\n            other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. \n        When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional personal information. \n        We also collect other types of personal information that you provide to us voluntarily. \n        If you participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion, we will collect any data you provide in\n            connection with that promotion. \n        We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Services. \n        We may also collect personal information at other points in our Services that state that personal information is\n            being collected. \n\n        IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:\n        \n            When you use our Services, some information is automatically collected. For example, when you use our Services,\n                how you use the Services, information about the type of device you use, your Open Device Identification Number,\n                date/time stamps for your visit, your unique device identifier, your browser type, operating system, Internet\n                Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This information is generally used to help us deliver\n                the most relevant information to you and administer and improve the Services. In addition, in the event our\n                Application crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software\n                version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of\n                our Application.\n            \n            We may gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, including IP addresses, browser type,\n                Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\n                We use this information to improve the content of the Services, market research purposes, to communicate\n                information to visitors and to better tailor our Services to our users\u2019 needs.\n            \n            We use third party analytics services to help analyze how users use the Services. These analytics services use\n                Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Services and we use the information to\n                improve our Services and Services. The analytics services\u2019 ability to use and share information collected by them is\n                restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how\n                these entities use this information.\n            \n            We may collect and create anonymous and/or deidentified data records about how both unregistered and\n                registered users, collectively, use the Services (\"Aggregate Information\"), such as the number and frequency of visitors to\n                the Site or Application. Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. We reserve the right to\n                use Aggregate Information for any purpose and disclose it to third parties in our sole discretion. This\n                Aggregate Information is not Personal Information and we use reasonable efforts to ensure that it cannot be tied\n                back to you, your Account, your web browser or mobile device. We use this anonymous data to enhance the content\n                of our Services and improve the Services, for example by allowing us and third parties authorized by us to\n                figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.\n            \n        \n\n        Email Communications:\n        We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer\n            service. \n        Information Collected Using Cookies:\n        \n            Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser or mobile device\n                when you access a website. The information we gather helps us to better understand how you use the Services in order\n                to improve your user experience and the way the Services operate. Your browser or mobile device stores cookies\n                in a manner associated with each website or application you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to\n                recognize your web browser or mobile device and tell us how and when you use the Services.\n            \n            Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information\n                collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use\n                cookies to identify that your web browser or mobile device has accessed aspects of the Services and may\n                associate that information with your Account if you have one.\n            \n            Most browsers or mobile devices have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your\n                browser or mobile device from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your\n                browser or mobile device software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We\n                strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they may enable you to take advantage of some features\n                of the Services.\n            \n            This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do\n                not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or mobile device. For example, third party\n                websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer or mobile device.\n            \n        \n\n        Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons:\n        We don\u2019t serve advertisements. We may serve it in the future. In that case, this Policy will be amended\n            accordingly. \n        General Uses of Information:\n        We use personal information collected through our Services for purposes described in this Privacy Policy or\n            disclosed to you in connection with our Services. For example, we may use your information to: \n        \n            operate, maintain, and improve our sites, products, and services;\n            process and deliver contest entries and rewards;\n            respond to comments and questions and provide customer service;\n            send information including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and\n                administrative messages;\n            \n            communicate about promotions, upcoming events, and other news about products and services offered by us and our\n                selected partners;\n            \n            link or combine user information with other personal information we get from third parties, to help\n                understand your needs and provide you with better service;\n            \n            protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity;\n            to process orders or otherwise provide and deliver products and services you request;\n            to process and deliver orders for additional services;\n            identify you as a user in our system;\n            facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network; and\n            develop and improve marketing and advertising for the Services and partner services.\n        \n        We may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries. \n        We may get information about you from other sources. We may add this to information we get from the Services. \n        How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared? \n        The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information\n            generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties. \n\n        Public Information about Your Activity on the Services:\n        Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to,\n            content you have posted publicly on the Site or Application or otherwise through the Services. \n        Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts. Unregistered users will not\n            have this association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be\n            tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us. \n        Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the\n            Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be\n            publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our\n            control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think\n            carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information\n            that you submit through the Services. \n\n        IP Address Information:\n        While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however,\n            share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and\n            as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy. \n        User Profile Information:\n        User profile information including your username and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to\n            facilitate user interaction within the Services. We will not directly reveal user email addresses to other\n            users. \n        Financial Information:\n        We do not collect financial information. \n\n        Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:\n        In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one\n            of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go\n            out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by\n            a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue\n            to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may share your Personal\n            Information with our subsidiaries and affiliates. \n\n        Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:\n        We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Personal Information as it reasonably\n            believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this\n            Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect,\n            prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v)\n            protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other\n            companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention. \n\n        Information We Share With Your Consent:\n        We may share your Personal Information to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it, for any other purpose\n            disclosed by us when you provide the information, with your consent, or to third parties designated by you. \n        Is Information About Me Secure?\n        Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent\n            unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately\n            and limiting access to your computer, phone, and browser or other device by signing off after you have finished\n            accessing your Account. \n        We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the\n            security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may\n            compromise the security of user information at any time. \n        We otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information, using industry-standard\n            techniques. We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the\n            integrity and security of Personal Information that we collect and maintain. While we use reasonable efforts\n            to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and we do not guarantee or\n            warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal\n            Information or otherwise.\n        What Information of Mine Can I Access? \n        If you are a registered user, you can access and edit information associated with your Account by logging into the\n            Services. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings. \n\n        California Privacy Rights:\n        Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice\n            identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties\n            for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a\n            California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address:\n            Alterra.ai, Inc., 341 El Carmelo Ave., Palo Alto CA 94306 \n\n        How Long Do You Store My Information?\n        Colibri stores all Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set out in this Policy,\n            or for as long as we are required to do so by law or in order to comply with a regulatory obligation. When\n            deleting Personal Information, we will take measures to render such Personal Information irrecoverable or\n            irreproducible, and the electronic files which contain Personal Information will be permanently deleted.\n\n        How Can I Delete My Account? \n        Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by emailing  info@colibri.ai. If you terminate your\n            Account, any association between your Account and information we store will no longer be accessible through your\n            Account. However, given the nature of sharing on the Services, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion\n            will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the public. We may retain an archived copy of your\n            records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. \n\n        What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information? \n        \n            You can use some of the features of the Services without registering for an Account, thereby limiting the type\n                of information that we collect.\n            \n            You can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take advantage\n                of some of our features.\n            \n            You can delete your Account. Please note that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the\n                Account, and activity generated prior to deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly accessible.\n            \n            You may opt-out of providing your Personal Information to the Application at any time by uninstalling the\n                Application.\n            \n        \n\n        What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy? \n        We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy\n            Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use\n            information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email and will change the Effective\n            Date (below). A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such\n            changes have been first posted. \n        What If I Have Questions or Concerns? \n        If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message to\n            info@colibri.ai.

This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European\n                    data protection law; provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the\n                    User and/or for any precontractual obligations thereof;\n            \n            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Colibri is subject;\n            processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of\n                official authority vested in Colibri;\n            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Colibri or\n                by a third party.\n        \n        In any case, Colibri will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and\n            in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement\n            necessary to enter into a contract.\n\n        Place\n        The Data is processed at Colibri's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in\n            the processing are located.\n        Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country\n            other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check\n            the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.\n\n        Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European\n            Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more\n            countries and about the security measures taken by Colibri to safeguard their Data.\n\n        If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document\n            or inquire with Colibri using the information provided in the contact section.\n\n        Retention time\n        Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.\n        Therefore:\n        \n            Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between Colibri and the\n                User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.\n            Personal Data collected for the purposes of Colibri\u2019s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as\n                needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests\n                pursued by Colibri within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting Colibri.\n        \n        Colibri may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such\n            processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, Colibri may be obliged to retain Personal\n            Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order\n            of an authority.\n\n        Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right\n            to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration\n            of the retention period.\n\n        The purposes of processing\n\n        The Data concerning the Users is collected to allow Colibri to provide its Service, comply with its legal\n            obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of its Users or\n            third parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent activity, as well as the following: Analytics,\n            Infrastructure monitoring, Tag Management, Hosting and backend infrastructure, Managing contacts and sending\n            messages, User database management, Handling payments and Managing support and contact requests.\n        For specific information about the Personal Data used for each purpose, the User may refer to the section\n            \"Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data\".\n\n        Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data\n        Personal Data is collected for the following purposes and using the following third-party service providers (each, a \u201csub-processor\u201d):\n\n        Analytics\n        The services contained in this section enable Colibri to monitor and analyze web traffic and can\n            be used to keep track of User behavior.\n        Google Analytics (Google LLC)\n        Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google LLC (\"Google\").
