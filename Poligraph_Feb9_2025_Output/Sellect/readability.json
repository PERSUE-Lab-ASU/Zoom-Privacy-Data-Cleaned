The European Commission, the UK, and Switzerland have issued or otherwise adopted adequacy decisions or regulations which allow for the transfer of personal information from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, respectively, to certain countries deemed to have adequate protection for personal information.&nbsp;</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Appropriate Safeguards.</strong> Standard contractual clauses (<strong>\u201cSCCs\u201d</strong>) are written commitments between parties that establish data protection safeguards. SCCs can be used as grounds for personal information transfers from the EEA to other countries. You can find the latest version of the approved SCCs, <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914\">here</a>. The European Commission has approved the use of SCCs for personal information transfers from the UK and Switzerland to other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework.</strong> The European Union and the United States reached an agreement that resulted in the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, which includes the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (collectively, the <strong>\u201cDPF\u201d</strong>). The DPF relates to the transfer of personal information from the EEA, UK (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland to the United States. The European Union has issued an adequacy decision, concluding that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection under the DPF. By self-certifying through the DPF, businesses and other entities may transfer personal information to the United States from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland in accordance with the GDPR.

If our business activities bring us within the scope of the GDPR and any of these webservers are physically located in the United States or another country outside of the individual\u2019s residence, the transfer of the personal information will comply with the GDPR on the basis of: (a) an adequacy decision in place that permits such transfer, as described above; (b) SCCs that we have put in place, as described above; or (c) self-certification under the DPF by us or our relevant affiliate, together with a data protection agreement in place between us and our affiliate to the extent required by the DPF.&nbsp;</p><p>\u200d<strong>6.\tMISCELLANEOUS&nbsp;</strong>\u200d</p><p>\u200d<strong>6.1\tDeidentified Information. </strong>With respect to deidentified information derived from your personal information, we retain the right to collect, process, use, store, sell, share, disclose, and distribute the deidentified information in accordance with applicable laws.
