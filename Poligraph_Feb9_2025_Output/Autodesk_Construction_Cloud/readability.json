For example, you may see a just in time privacy notice explaining a particular data collection program, or you may see a just in time privacy notice when registering for an event.\n\nThis Privacy Statement describes how we process personal data for our own purposes.

We do not control the data processing or protection practices of our customers, which may differ from those set out in this Privacy Statement.\nOur Privacy Statement applies only to data collected by Autodesk. We may provide links to third-party websites, but we are not responsible for their privacy practices. When you click on these links, you will be subject to the privacy practices of those websites. We encourage you to review their privacy statements before providing any information.\n\u201cPersonal data\u201d is information that identifies, or can reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to, an identifiable person.

Because we and our service providers maintain servers in global locations, your personal data may be transferred across national borders and stored on the servers outside of your country or region. We will retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary or permitted and proportionate to the purpose for which it was collected. For example, to provide you with the offerings that you are using or have requested, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and as needed to comply with our legal obligations. The criteria that we use to determine our retention period include the duration of our relationship with you, nature and sensitivity of the processed data, whether we have a legal obligation to keep the data, the risk of harm from unauthorized disclosure of data and whether the purpose of processing can be achieved by other means. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time. As described further below, you have the ability to delete information from your account at any time. There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize or de-identify your personal data due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance or other operational reasons.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n  \n    Does Autodesk transfer your personal data across national borders?\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  Because Autodesk is a global company, we transfer personal data across national borders to other countries, in compliance with the laws that apply to that data.\u00a0 For example, if your data is transferred from one of our entities in the European Economic Area (EEA) to the United States, or to another country outside of the EEA that does not provide adequate protection for personal data, as determined by the European Commission, we rely on our EU Binding Corporate Rules\u00a0 approved by the Irish Data Protection Commission in May 2023, which you can find on our website here. If your data is transferred from one of our entities in the United Kingdom or in Switzerland to a country that does not provide adequate protection for personal data (as determined by UK and Swiss Data Protection Laws) we rely on the legal mechanism of Standard Contractual Clauses for such transfers.\nAutodesk complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\u2018EU-U.S. DPF\u2019), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, European Commission, UK Government, and Swiss Federal Administration regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, and their related principles (the \"Data Privacy Framework Principles\"). Autodesk has certified to the U.S. International Trade Administration, within the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles.\u00a0 If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern.\nIn compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, Autodesk commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this policy should first contact at: privacy.help@autodesk.com.\nAutodesk has further committed to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution-American Arbitration Association (\u201cICDR-AAA\u201d), an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the ICDR-AAA DPF independent recourse mechanism. The services of ICDR-AAA are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may have the possibility to engage in binding arbitration to resolve residual disputes. For more information on this option, please see Annex I of the Data Privacy Framework Principles.\nAutodesk\u2019s commitment to subject the personal information described in this Policy to the Data Privacy Framework is subject to the enforcement and investigative powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view our certification, please visit\u00a0 https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.\nAutodesk may share personal information with third parties under certain circumstances described above. Autodesk\u2019s obligations under the Data Privacy Framework Principles extend to third parties acting as agents who help us run our business and provide services, and Autodesk remains liable should a third party acting as our agent process personal information subject to this Policy in a manner inconsistent with this Policy, except where Autodesk is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n  \n    What are Autodesk\u2019s marketing and advertising practices?\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  We use analytics tools and also work with one or more advertising networks and digital advertising partners (our \u201cAd Partners\u201d) that use Cookies to collect information about application visitors, to serve ads, and to help us track results of advertising and marketing campaigns. Partners of our Ad Partners may also use Cookies to collect information from you for these purposes. Through these means, we and/or our Ad Partners and their partners may be able to collect information from application visitors, including websites visited, how and when applications are used, marketing preferences, IP addresses, device IDs, and browser information. This information is used to display personalized advertising in websites and other applications, to calculate and control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, to deliver ads that relate to a visitor\u2019s interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. We process your personal data for the above activities in furtherance of our legitimate interests or, where required, with your consent.\nYou can opt out of the use of your information by certain Ad Partners for online behavioral advertising by using the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s\u00a0Your AdChoices\u00a0tool. The Your AdChoices tool may not work if your browser does not accept third-party Cookies, and if you delete Cookies, use a different browser, or use a different computer, you will need to use the tool again to renew your opt-out.\nIf you reside in the U.S., please see what additional rights you might have in the \"Privacy Rights under U.S. Privacy Laws\" section below.\nAs described above, you can change your Cookie preferences. Cookie choices are generally application-, browser-, and device-specific, so you may need to refresh your choices if you visit a different application, use a new browser or device, or clear your browser\u2019s cookies.\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n  \n    How does Autodesk protect children and student data?\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  At Autodesk, we care deeply about children\u2019s privacy and protecting their data.\nMost of our applications are made for the general public and are designed for adult users. We refer to these applications as \u201cgeneral interest applications.\u201d We do not knowingly collect personal data from children in connection with general interest applications. If you become aware of any unauthorized submission of children's personal information to Autodesk, please inform us by contacting us using the contact information listed below so that we may conduct the necessary investigation which may result in deletion of the data. \u00a0Certain applications are appropriate for and are intended for use by children. We refer to these applications as \u201cChildren\u2019s applications.\u201d\nOur Children\u2019s Privacy Statement applies to personal data collected from certain child and student users of Autodesk offerings, including Children's applications. If there is a conflict between our Children\u2019s Privacy Statement and our Privacy Statement, the Children\u2019s Privacy Statement sets the standard for how we process children\u2019s personal data. For more information, please refer to our Children\u2019s Privacy Statement.\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n  \n    Is the personal data you give us ever displayed publicly?\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  As always, we urge you to be mindful when deciding to disclose personal data, including on our offerings. Our offerings may allow you to post content, including comments and \u201clikes,\u201d that can be visible to the public.\nIn some cases, you can limit who can view or access the information and content you post. In other cases, the information and content might be available to registered members of the offering, or even to the general public. Your name, username, profile image, or email address (particularly if this is your username) may be posted along with any message or other content you post through some of our offerings.\nIf you are posting information you do not want to be disclosed publicly, make sure you are using an offering that allows you to control who sees information you have posted.\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n  \n    Will this Privacy Statement change?\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nWe may change this Privacy Statement to reflect changes in the law, our data handling practices, or the features of our business. The updated Privacy Statement will be available at our Trust Center here. We will show the date the Privacy Statement was last updated to help you know when we change it. If we make material changes to our Privacy Statement, we will endeavor to provide you with notice before such changes take effect, such as through prominent notice on our website or services or by email.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    Privacy Rights under U.S. Privacy Laws\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n  ", "length": 33633, "excerpt": "Autodesk Privacy Statement", "siteName": null, "applied": false}
