These Products and Services are offered under a \u201cSoftware as a Service\u201d model, which is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is centrally hosted and made available to multiple users over a network, including through interacting products (including front-end clients, apps, Web-Interface, plugins, or connectors to third-party applications).\nTo the extent the Data Subject is interacting with the Products and Services (see the then current Products and Services offerings at www.showpad.com/overview), and/or the Customer Content managed thereon, the Data Subject\u2019s engagement therewith is measured, analysed and reported back to the Showpad Customer.\nThe aim is to provide the Showpad Customer through the Products and Services with the information, insights, analytics and tools to help\u00a0the Showpad Customer to streamline and improve interactions by and between their internal collaborators (e.g. sales teams, marketing teams, \u2026) and/or third parties (e.g. potential buyers).\nExcept in the limited cases as explicitly stated in the Showpad Privacy Policy for which Showpad is data \u201cController\u201d (see FAQ B12), Personal Data in respect of the Products and Services is not processed for any other purpose.\nFor avoidance of doubt, under these Privacy Principles, Showpad does NOT process the Personal Data for any other purposes than as described in this FAQ B1.\n            \n          \n        \n              \n          \n            \n              2.

As such, the Products and Services are not aimed towards children and minors, nor should it be used for such purpose.\nThe Products and Services do not knowingly process Personal Data of children and minors.\nIf a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided Personal Data that is processed by the Products and Services without their consent, he or she should contact the Showpad Customer who is the data \u201cController\u201d (see FAQ B12).\n            \n          \n        \n              \n          \n            \n              12.

Should Showpad receive such request directly from a Data Subject, Showpad can legally only pass such request on to the Showpad Customer. Showpad is legally not allowed to respond to such request, unless as instructed by the Showpad Customer.\nSeeing the above, Showpad is only offering the means allowing the Showpad Customer to interact with the Data Subject through the Products and Services, and as Showpad is merely acting upon instructions of the Showpad Customer, this means that Showpad is processing the Data Subject\u2019s Personal Data as a so-called data \u201cProcessor\u201d for and on behalf of the Showpad Customer.\nNotwithstanding the above, in the limited cases as explicitly stated in the Showpad Privacy Policy (see FAQ A3), certain Personal Data resulting from the relationship between Showpad and the Showpad Customer, may be processed by Showpad as being the data \u201c Controller\u201d (e.g. as required for Showpad as a controller to administer the (contractual) relationship between Showpad and its Customer, or, providing support).
