              <p>As a company that finds its roots in the European Union, and that considers compliance to privacy legislation a core principle of its organisation, Showpad has created these Privacy Principles based upon the foundations of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data).</p>
<p>As GDPR currently is the most advanced and elaborate data protection legislation in the world, Showpad uses GDPR as its main benchmark for its companywide privacy program.</p>
<p>Seeing the global activities of Showpad, it goes without saying that with these Privacy Principles, in addition to GDPR, also want to take into account the principles of other applicable data protection laws&nbsp; (such as the California Consumer Privacy act of 2018, or, the Swiss Data Protection act).</p>
<p>The principles of such other data protection legislations have either already been incorporated through GDPR (in most of the cases) or either have specifically been added to these Privacy Principles.</p>

<p>Showpad is acting as “Processor” / “Service Provider” in respect of the operation of the Products and Services and not as data controller (see FAQ B12), which means that the Customer Policy shall always have priority over these Privacy Principles.</p>

These Products and Services are offered under a “Software as a Service” model, which is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is centrally hosted and made available to multiple users over a network, including through interacting products (including front-end clients, apps, Web-Interface, plugins, or connectors to third-party applications).</p>
<p>To the extent the Data Subject is interacting with the Products and Services (see the then current Products and Services offerings at <a href="https://www.showpad.com/overview/">www.showpad.com/overview</a>), and/or the Customer Content managed thereon, the Data Subject’s engagement therewith is measured, analysed and reported back to the Showpad Customer.</p>
<p>The aim is to provide the Showpad Customer through the Products and Services with the information, insights, analytics and tools to help&nbsp;the Showpad Customer to streamline and improve interactions by and between their internal collaborators (e.g. sales teams, marketing teams, …) and/or third parties (e.g. potential buyers).</p>
<p>Except in the limited cases as explicitly stated in the Showpad Privacy Policy for which Showpad is data “Controller” (see FAQ B12), Personal Data in respect of the Products and Services is not processed for any other purpose.</p>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, under these Privacy Principles, Showpad does <u>NOT</u> process the Personal Data for any other purposes than as described in this FAQ B1.</p>

<li>Contact information (e.g. name, email address, telephone number, …)</li>
<li>Account information (e.g. password, profile picture, role, device information, logon information, Language preference from the browser…)</li>

<li>Connection information (e.g. IP address, geolocation, …)</li>
<li>Customer Content (e.g. documents, presentations, audio, video, … as uploaded onto and managed by the Products and Services)</li>
<li>Communications (e.g. Chat content, reviews, comments, Admin announcements, …)</li>
<li>Information from third party integrations (connected calendars, CRM data, Marketing data, …)</li>

<p>The Products and Services process Personal Data for and on behalf of Showpad Customer. It is the Showpad Customer who is acting as data “Controller” (see FAQ B12) and therefore who determines what Personal Data of which Data Subject to process.</p>
<p>This information is also made available to the Showpad Customer via the privacy settings within the Administrator part of the Products and Services.

<ul>
<li>Manages user accounts to the Products and Services (e.g. password reset, access rights, third-party integrations, suspending accounts, grouping users, assigning channels, …);</li>
<li>Manages the Customer Content being made available through the Products and Services;</li>
<li>Determines which Data Subjects to interact with through the Products and Services (and thus whose Personal Data are to be processed);</li>
<li>Determines for which purpose the Products and Services are to be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is therefore&nbsp;the Showpad Customer who legally is acting as the so-called data “Controller”.</p>
<p>Therefore, all inquiries the Data Subject may have, or rights the Data Subject may want to exercise with regard to the processing of one’s Personal Data through the Products and Services, need to be addressed to the Showpad Customer (see FAQ E2). Should Showpad receive such request directly from a Data Subject, Showpad can legally only pass such request on to the Showpad Customer. Showpad is legally not allowed to respond to such request, unless as instructed by the Showpad Customer.</p>
<p>Seeing the above, Showpad is only offering the means allowing the Showpad Customer to interact with the Data Subject through the Products and Services, and as Showpad is merely acting upon instructions of the Showpad Customer, this means that Showpad is processing the Data Subject’s Personal Data as a so-called data “Processor” for and on behalf of the Showpad Customer.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, in the limited cases as explicitly stated in the Showpad Privacy Policy (see FAQ A3), certain Personal Data resulting from the relationship between Showpad and the Showpad Customer, may be processed by Showpad as being the data “ Controller” (e.g. as required for Showpad as a controller to administer the (contractual) relationship between Showpad and its Customer, or, providing support).

<p>The legal basis for processing Third-Party Data Subject’s Personal Data is dependent on the privacy setting (as determined by the Showpad Customer), for example, where processing of Third-Party Data Subject’s Personal Data uses the setting of:</p>
<p>=&gt; Seeking prior consent from the Third-Party Data Subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>consent will be sought at the moment of first interaction with the Products and Services or the Customer Content made available thereon (except for virtual human interactions (e.g. online meetings)).</li>

</ul>
<p>=&gt; Informing the Third-Party Data Subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>an information banner can be made to appear at the moment of first interaction with the Products and Services or the Customer Content made available thereon (except for virtual human interactions (e.g. online meetings)), referring such Third-Party Data Subject to an applicable privacy policy.</li>
<li>An information footer can be enabled in the emails that are send out of the Products and Services to a Third-Party Data Subject.</li>

<p>In respect of EEA residents, consent is an allowed basis for the lawful processing of Personal Data (see section 6,1 (a) GDPR). Additionally, certain Personal Data is processed based on legitimate interest (e.g. see section 6,1 (f) GDPR) because:</p>

<ul>
<li>IP address is used to determine origin of the request resulting in certain privacy settings becoming applicable or not;</li>
<li>email address of a (re-shared) Third-Party Data Subject is used for the technical aspects of delivering the message to the recipient under an SMTP protocol;</li>
<li>email pixel is incorporated in emails sent out (without reporting back if outside of policy coverage);</li>
